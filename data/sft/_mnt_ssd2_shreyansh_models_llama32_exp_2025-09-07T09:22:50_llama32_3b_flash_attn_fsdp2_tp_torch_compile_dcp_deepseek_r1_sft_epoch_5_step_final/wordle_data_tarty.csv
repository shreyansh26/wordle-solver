We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.",Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.

Like ""R_____"" but note we don\'t know the other letters.\n\n Let\'s consider common words:\n\n Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\n But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? \n   However, we must check the positions: \n   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn\'t tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? \n\n However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.\n\n But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn\'t prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a \'-\' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don\'t know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a \'-\' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? \n\n Actually, the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning:\n   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.\n\n So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it\'s not there. We can try A in a different position.\n\n Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.\n\n So for our next guess, we can try:\n   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don\'t know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? \n\n But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? \n\n However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Common words: \n   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it\'s not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n We can try:\n   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.\n\n Let me try to list some words:\n\n Option: ""RAPID"" -> \n   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. \n   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). \n\n But we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> \n   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n How about ""TRAIL""? \n   T, R, A, I, L -> \n   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same as before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words:\n\n   ""PARTY"": \n      P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). \n        Positions: \n          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n\n   This seems good: \n        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that\'s a new position and we can test it.\n        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.\n\n   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.\n\n   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.\n\n   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.\n\n   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": \n        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. \n\n   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n   Let me compare:\n      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don\'t know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don\'t know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.\n\n      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.\n\n   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": \n        Position 1: P (new)\n        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)\n        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)\n        Position 4: T (new)\n        Position 5: Y (new)\n\n   This seems efficient.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> \n        S, T, A, M, P -> \n        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.\n\n   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""TAROT""? -> \n        T, A, R, O, T -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n        But it has two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\n   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.\n\n   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> \n        R, A, L, L, Y -> \n        R at position 1? \n        A at position 2? \n        Then L at positions 3 and 4? \n        But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   However, we are testing L.\n\n   But note: we are using two L\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\n   How about ""RAPID""? \n        R, A, P, I, D -> \n        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the secret word has P, I, D.\n\n   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.\n\n   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. \n\n   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven\'t tried and also test new letters.\n\n   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:\n        R at position 1, and A at position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.\n\n   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A\'s? and M? \n        D, R, A, M, A -> \n        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n   So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""HARPY""? \n        H, A, R, P, Y -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? \n        Positions: \n          1: H (new)\n          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)\n          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tried position 3 for R -> good)\n          4: P (new)\n          5: Y (new)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".\n\n   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven\'t tried H, P, Y.\n\n   However, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n   Let me see the frequency: \n        In English, S is very common.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

From Guess 2:
  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). 
  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y

We know the word is: ? A R T Y

We also know from Guess 1 that:
  R is in the word but not at position 2? Actually, in the secret word, R is at position 3? So that's consistent? Because in Guess 1, R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Now we see R is at position 3? So that matches.

Additionally, we know:
  - The letter A is at position 2? But in Guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we see A is at position 2? So that's a contradiction? Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? 
In Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? 

But the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? 

Wait, how does that align? 
  - The secret word has A at position 2? 
  - So the word is: _ A R T Y

Now, what about the first guess: 
  - We had R at position 2? But now we know R is at position 3? So the secret word does not have R at position 2? That's consistent.

Also, we know:
  - The secret word does not contain C, N, E (from Guess 1) and does not contain P (from Guess 2).

So the secret word is: [not C,N,E,P] A R T Y

We need to find a letter for the first position? It must be a letter that:
  - Is not C, N, E, P
  - Forms a valid English word with ""ARTY""

What are the possibilities? 
  - We can have: 
        B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be ""ARTY"" + one letter? Actually, the word is ""ARTY"" followed by one letter? 

Common words: 
  - ""PARTY"" we already tried? But that was our guess? We are not the word? 
  - ""ARTY"" is not a word? So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? 

Actually, the word is: ?ARTY

So we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". 

Common words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven't tested D? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? 
  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? 

But also: 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? 
  - ""EARTY""? E is not allowed? 
  - ""FARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""HARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""IARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""JARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

Wait, what about ""DAIRY""? 
  - D is not forbidden? We haven't eliminated D? 
  - ""DAIRY"" is a word? Yes, meaning something that belongs to a dairy? 

But also, ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"", ""LAIRY"" (but not common), ""MAIRY"" (not common), ""RAIRY"" (not common), ""WAIRY"" (not common). 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter must not be one of the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P.

So possible words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> D is allowed? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F is allowed? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H is allowed? 

But wait: in the second guess, we got A(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 4, Y(✓) at position 5. So the word must end with ""ARTY"". 

And we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? 

Also, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that's consistent? 

What about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? 

So the secret word is: [letter]ARTY

What letters can we put at the beginning? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). 

Also, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven't seen D, F, H, etc. 

But note: we haven't tested D, F, H, etc. 

So the candidates are: 
  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? 

But also: are there other words? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

What about ""ARTY"" itself? But that's 5 letters? ""ARTY"" is 5 letters? But we are putting an extra letter? 

Wait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY

We have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". 

But also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
""UARTY""? Not a word? 
""VARTY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". 

However, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? 

But we can try one of these? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence? 

But in the pattern, the first letter is separate? 

So we can try ""DAIRY"". 

But let me double-check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That's consistent? Because A is at position 2? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, '-' is consistent? 

Now, what about the second guess: ""party""? 
  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? 

And T and Y were also ✓? 

So the pattern holds: _ A R T Y

Therefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

But also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? 

Or ""UARTY""? No. 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven't thought of? 

We can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? 

But we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? 

But we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? 

We can try ""HAIRY"" next? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's a change? 

But the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:
  D at position 1? 
  A at position 2? (we know it's correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? 

But note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? 

Similarly, R at position 3? We know it's correct? 

So if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:
  D: ? 
  A: ✓ (position 2)
  R: ✓ (position 3)
  T: ✓ (position 4)
  Y: ✓ (position 5)

So the only unknown is the first letter? 

But we don't have any information about D? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven't used D, F, H? 

So we can choose any? 

But we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

We can try ""dairy"" because it's a common word? 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? 

We can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That's correct? 

And A at position 2? Correct? 

So we are hoping that D is the first letter? 

But if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? 

But we don't have any information about F or H? 

So we can choose ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven't? But we know T is at position 4? 

Similarly, Y at position 5? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we can guess ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

I think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it's common? 

But we don't know? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? 

So we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In Guess 1: 
  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that's consistent? 

R was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: 
  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that's what we have? 

So the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY

We can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". 

But we have no information about D, F, H? 

So we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

So I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? 

But let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? 

So we guess ""dairy"". 

But note: we are on the third guess? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""dairy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".
3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).

### Strategy:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

So I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? 

But let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? 

So we guess ""dairy"". 

But note: we are on the third guess? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".
3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).

### Strategy:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.

<guess>party</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

From Guess 2:
  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). 
  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y

We know the word is: ? A R T Y

We also know from Guess 1 that:
  R is in the word but not at position 2? Actually, in the secret word, R is at position 3? So that's consistent? Because in Guess 1, R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Now we see R is at position 3? So that matches.

Additionally, we know:
  - The letter A is at position 2? But in Guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we see A is at position 2? So that's a contradiction? Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? 
In Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? 

But the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? 

Wait, how does that align? 
  - The secret word has A at position 2? 
  - So the word is: _ A R T Y

Now, what about the first guess: 
  - We had R at position 2? But now we know R is at position 3? So the secret word does not have R at position 2? That's consistent.

Also, we know:
  - The secret word does not contain C, N, E (from Guess 1) and does not contain P (from Guess 2).

So the secret word is: [not C,N,E,P] A R T Y

We need to find a letter for the first position? It must be a letter that:
  - Is not C, N, E, P
  - Forms a valid English word with ""ARTY""

What are the possibilities? 
  - We can have: 
        B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be ""ARTY"" + one letter? Actually, the word is ""ARTY"" followed by one letter? 

Common words: 
  - ""PARTY"" we already tried? But that was our guess? We are not the word? 
  - ""ARTY"" is not a word? So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? 

Actually, the word is: ?ARTY

So we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". 

Common words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven't tested D? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? 
  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? 

But also: 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? 
  - ""EARTY""? E is not allowed? 
  - ""FARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""HARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""IARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""JARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

Wait, what about ""DAIRY""? 
  - D is not forbidden? We haven't eliminated D? 
  - ""DAIRY"" is a word? Yes, meaning something that belongs to a dairy? 

But also, ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"", ""LAIRY"" (but not common), ""MAIRY"" (not common), ""RAIRY"" (not common), ""WAIRY"" (not common). 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter must not be one of the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P.

So possible words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> D is allowed? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F is allowed? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H is allowed? 

But wait: in the second guess, we got A(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 4, Y(✓) at position 5. So the word must end with ""ARTY"". 

And we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? 

Also, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that's consistent? 

What about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? 

So the secret word is: [letter]ARTY

What letters can we put at the beginning? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). 

Also, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven't seen D, F, H, etc. 

But note: we haven't tested D, F, H, etc. 

So the candidates are: 
  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? 

But also: are there other words? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

What about ""ARTY"" itself? But that's 5 letters? ""ARTY"" is 5 letters? But we are putting an extra letter? 

Wait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY

We have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". 

But also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
""UARTY""? Not a word? 
""VARTY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". 

However, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? 

But we can try one of these? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence? 

But in the pattern, the first letter is separate? 

So we can try ""DAIRY"". 

But let me double-check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That's consistent? Because A is at position 2? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, '-' is consistent? 

Now, what about the second guess: ""party""? 
  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? 

And T and Y were also ✓? 

So the pattern holds: _ A R T Y

Therefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

But also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? 

Or ""UARTY""? No. 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven't thought of? 

We can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? 

But we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? 

But we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? 

We can try ""HAIRY"" next? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's a change? 

But the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:
  D at position 1? 
  A at position 2? (we know it's correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? 

But note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? 

Similarly, R at position 3? We know it's correct? 

So if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:
  D: ? 
  A: ✓ (position 2)
  R: ✓ (position 3)
  T: ✓ (position 4)
  Y: ✓ (position 5)

So the only unknown is the first letter? 

But we don't have any information about D? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven't used D, F, H? 

So we can choose any? 

But we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

We can try ""dairy"" because it's a common word? 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? 

We can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That's correct? 

And A at position 2? Correct? 

So we are hoping that D is the first letter? 

But if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? 

But we don't have any information about F or H? 

So we can choose ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven't? But we know T is at position 4? 

Similarly, Y at position 5? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we can guess ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

I think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it's common? 

But we don't know? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? 

So we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In Guess 1: 
  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that's consistent? 

R was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: 
  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that's what we have? 

So the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY

We can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". 

But we have no information about D, F, H? 

So we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

So I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? 

But let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? 

So we guess ""dairy"". 

But note: we are on the third guess? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".
3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).

### Strategy:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.

Does not include C, N, E.\n\n Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\n We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.\n\n We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.\n\n Example: \n   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don\'t know the other letters.\n\n Let\'s consider common words:\n\n Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\n But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? \n   However, we must check the positions: \n   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn\'t tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? \n\n However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.\n\n But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn\'t prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a \'-\' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don\'t know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a \'-\' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? \n\n Actually, the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning:\n   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.\n\n So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it\'s not there. We can try A in a different position.\n\n Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.\n\n So for our next guess, we can try:\n   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don\'t know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? \n\n But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? \n\n However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Common words: \n   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it\'s not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n We can try:\n   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.\n\n Let me try to list some words:\n\n Option: ""RAPID"" -> \n   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. \n   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). \n\n But we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> \n   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n How about ""TRAIL""? \n   T, R, A, I, L -> \n   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same as before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words:\n\n   ""PARTY"": \n      P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). \n        Positions: \n          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n\n   This seems good: \n        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that\'s a new position and we can test it.\n        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.\n\n   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.\n\n   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.\n\n   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.\n\n   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": \n        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. \n\n   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n   Let me compare:\n      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don\'t know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don\'t know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.\n\n      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.\n\n   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": \n        Position 1: P (new)\n        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)\n        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)\n        Position 4: T (new)\n        Position 5: Y (new)\n\n   This seems efficient.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> \n        S, T, A, M, P -> \n        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.\n\n   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""TAROT""? -> \n        T, A, R, O, T -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n        But it has two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\n   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.\n\n   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> \n        R, A, L, L, Y -> \n        R at position 1? \n        A at position 2? \n        Then L at positions 3 and 4? \n        But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   However, we are testing L.\n\n   But note: we are using two L\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\n   How about ""RAPID""? \n        R, A, P, I, D -> \n        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the secret word has P, I, D.\n\n   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.\n\n   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. \n\n   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven\'t tried and also test new letters.\n\n   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:\n        R at position 1, and A at position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.\n\n   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A\'s? and M? \n        D, R, A, M, A -> \n        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n   So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""HARPY""? \n        H, A, R, P, Y -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? \n        Positions: \n          1: H (new)\n          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)\n          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tried position 3 for R -> good)\n          4: P (new)\n          5: Y (new)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".\n\n   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven\'t tried H, P, Y.\n\n   However, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n   Let me see the frequency: \n        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.\n\n   But we don\'t know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.\n\n   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S\'s? and we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? \n\n   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.\n\n   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.\n\n   So we must avoid N.\n\n   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:\n        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried for A).\n        - It introduces S, P, Y.\n\n   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": \n        P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.\n\n   This seems equally good.\n\n   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.\n\n   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n   So my next guess: ""PARTY""\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n   But note: we are going to get feedback on:\n        P at position 1 -> if it\'s in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.\n        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we\'ll get feedback on whether it\'s at position 2? Or if it\'s elsewhere.\n\n   This is going to give us more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> \n        F, L, A, I, R -> \n        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.\n\n   How about ""ALARM""? -> \n        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? \n\n   We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.\n\n   But we are using two A\'s? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.\n\n   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""PARTY""\n\n   Guess: ""party""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.\n- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.\n2. Exclude C, N, and E.\n3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""party""** because:\n- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).\n- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, not at position 2)\n  A: - (in word, not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). \n  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y\n\nWe know the word is: ?

Not a word? \n""UARTY""? Not a word? \n""VARTY""? Not a word? \n\nAnother possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? \n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". \n\nHowever, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? \n\nBut we can try one of these? \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any evidence? \n\nBut in the pattern, the first letter is separate? \n\nSo we can try ""DAIRY"". \n\nBut let me double-check: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That\'s consistent? Because A is at position 2? \n\nSimilarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, \'-\' is consistent? \n\nNow, what about the second guess: ""party""? \n  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? \n\nAnd T and Y were also ✓? \n\nSo the pattern holds: _ A R T Y\n\nTherefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nBut also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? \n\nOr ""UARTY""? No. \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven\'t thought of? \n\nWe can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? \n\nBut we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? \n\nBut we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? \n\nWe can try ""HAIRY"" next? \n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That\'s a change? \n\nBut the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:\n  D at position 1? \n  A at position 2? (we know it\'s correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? \n\nBut note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? \n\nSimilarly, R at position 3? We know it\'s correct? \n\nSo if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:\n  D: ? \n  A: ✓ (position 2)\n  R: ✓ (position 3)\n  T: ✓ (position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo the only unknown is the first letter? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about D? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven\'t used D, F, H? \n\nSo we can choose any? \n\nBut we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nWe can try ""dairy"" because it\'s a common word? \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? \n\nWe can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me confirm: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That\'s correct? \n\nAnd A at position 2? Correct? \n\nSo we are hoping that D is the first letter? \n\nBut if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut note: we have to make a guess? \n\nAnother candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about F or H? \n\nSo we can choose ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven\'t? But we know T is at position 4? \n\nSimilarly, Y at position 5? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? \n\nSo we can guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nI think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it\'s common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? \n\nSo we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: \n\nIn Guess 1: \n  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that\'s consistent? \n\nR was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? \n\nIn Guess 2: \n  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that\'s what we have? \n\nSo the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY\n\nWe can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". \n\nBut we have no information about D, F, H? \n\nSo we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? \n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nSo I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? \n\nBut let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo we guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are on the third guess? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nTherefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.\n- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).\n2. The first letter must:\n   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).\n   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".\n3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).\n\n### Strategy:\n- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 3? because we have R at position 3 in the secret word? But wait, in ""dairy"", R is at position 3? And we got '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position 3? That would be inconsistent because we know R is at position 3? 

Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we have A at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓). So the secret word has A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

But in Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We put D at position 1: x (not in word)
  A at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x (not in word)
  R at position 4: - (in word but not at position 4? because we know R is at position 3? So R should be at position 3? Not 4? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - Actually, we already knew R was at position 3 from Guess 2? So why are we getting '-' for R at position 4? 

This is confusing? 

Let me check the positions:

In the secret word, the positions are:
  Position 1: ? (we don't know)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: T (fixed)
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We have:
    Position 1: D -> x (so D is not the first letter)
    Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
    Position 3: I -> x (I is not in the word)
    Position 4: R -> - (but we know R is at position 3? So this R at position 4 is wrong? And we know R is in the word? So why are we getting '-'? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 is '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we already know R is at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

But then why in ""dairy"" we have R at position 4? And we get '-'? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? But we know it has R at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

So the pattern is fixed: the secret word is [letter] A R T Y

Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that is not C, N, E, P, D, I? (because we have eliminated these letters: C, N, E, P, D, I)

And the word must be a valid English word.

So what are the possibilities? 

We need to find a letter for the first position that makes a valid 5-letter word with ""ARTY"".

Common words: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning?

Also, less common: 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But we have to check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, A is at position 2? So that's consistent? 

And R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> consistent? 

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> we had R at position 4? (but we know R is at position 3? So position 4 is not R? And we get '-' for R at position 4? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? Which is consistent because R is fixed at position 3? 

So the secret word is either ""fairy"" or ""hairy"".

But we have to confirm: 

We know the secret word has R at position 3? So in ""fairy"" and ""hairy"", R is at position 3? 

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, D, I.

So ""fairy"" and ""hairy"" are both possible? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess ""fairy"" next? 

But we have two options? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? 

We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have 4 guesses left? 

So we can do that? 

But we can also try to use a word that tests both possibilities? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

So we must choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> we don't know about F? 
  A (fixed at position 2)
  R (fixed at position 3)
  T (fixed at position 4)
  Y (fixed at position 5)

So if we guess ""fairy"", we are testing F at position 1? 

If F is correct? Then we have the word? 

If F is wrong? Then the word must be ""hairy""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So I'll go with ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already excluded? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- The first letter must be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
- The only common words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Deductions:
1. **FAIRY** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested). 
2. **HAIRY** tests the letter **H** (not previously tested).
3. Neither word contains any excluded letters (C, N, E, P, D, I).

### Strategy:
- Since only the first letter is unknown, we can test one candidate at a time. 
- ""FAIRY"" is a more common word than ""HAIRY"", so it is prioritized.
- If ""FAIRY"" is incorrect, the answer must be ""HAIRY"" (unless uncommon words exist, but ""FAIRY"" is a valid English word).

<guess>fairy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""party"")**: A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2–5. P is absent.
- **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**: A, R, T, Y remain correct in positions 2–5. D and I are absent. 

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A R T Y` (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter **not** in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
3. The only common English words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested).
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.

<guess>fairy</guess>",fairy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we have A at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓). So the secret word has A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

But in Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We put D at position 1: x (not in word)
  A at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x (not in word)
  R at position 4: - (in word but not at position 4? because we know R is at position 3? So R should be at position 3? Not 4? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - Actually, we already knew R was at position 3 from Guess 2? So why are we getting '-' for R at position 4? 

This is confusing? 

Let me check the positions:

In the secret word, the positions are:
  Position 1: ? (we don't know)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: T (fixed)
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We have:
    Position 1: D -> x (so D is not the first letter)
    Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
    Position 3: I -> x (I is not in the word)
    Position 4: R -> - (but we know R is at position 3? So this R at position 4 is wrong? And we know R is in the word? So why are we getting '-'? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 is '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we already know R is at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

But then why in ""dairy"" we have R at position 4? And we get '-'? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? But we know it has R at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

So the pattern is fixed: the secret word is [letter] A R T Y

Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that is not C, N, E, P, D, I? (because we have eliminated these letters: C, N, E, P, D, I)

And the word must be a valid English word.

So what are the possibilities? 

We need to find a letter for the first position that makes a valid 5-letter word with ""ARTY"".

Common words: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning?

Also, less common: 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But we have to check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, A is at position 2? So that's consistent? 

And R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> consistent? 

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> we had R at position 4? (but we know R is at position 3? So position 4 is not R? And we get '-' for R at position 4? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? Which is consistent because R is fixed at position 3? 

So the secret word is either ""fairy"" or ""hairy"".

But we have to confirm: 

We know the secret word has R at position 3? So in ""fairy"" and ""hairy"", R is at position 3? 

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, D, I.

So ""fairy"" and ""hairy"" are both possible? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess ""fairy"" next? 

But we have two options? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? 

We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have 4 guesses left? 

So we can do that? 

But we can also try to use a word that tests both possibilities? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

So we must choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> we don't know about F? 
  A (fixed at position 2)
  R (fixed at position 3)
  T (fixed at position 4)
  Y (fixed at position 5)

So if we guess ""fairy"", we are testing F at position 1? 

If F is correct? Then we have the word? 

If F is wrong? Then the word must be ""hairy""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So I'll go with ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already excluded? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- The first letter must be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
- The only common words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Deductions:
1. **FAIRY** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested). 
2. **HAIRY** tests the letter **H** (not previously tested).
3. Neither word contains any excluded letters (C, N, E, P, D, I).

### Strategy:
- Since only the first letter is unknown, we can test one candidate at a time. 
- ""FAIRY"" is a more common word than ""HAIRY"", so it is prioritized.
- If ""FAIRY"" is incorrect, the answer must be ""HAIRY"" (unless uncommon words exist, but ""FAIRY"" is a valid English word).

<guess>fairy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""party"")**: A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2–5. P is absent.
- **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**: A, R, T, Y remain correct in positions 2–5. D and I are absent. 

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A R T Y` (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter **not** in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
3. The only common English words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested).
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.",Guess 4: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.

<guess>party</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

From Guess 2:
  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). 
  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y

We know the word is: ? A R T Y

We also know from Guess 1 that:
  R is in the word but not at position 2? Actually, in the secret word, R is at position 3? So that's consistent? Because in Guess 1, R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Now we see R is at position 3? So that matches.

Additionally, we know:
  - The letter A is at position 2? But in Guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we see A is at position 2? So that's a contradiction? Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? 
In Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? 

But the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? 

Wait, how does that align? 
  - The secret word has A at position 2? 
  - So the word is: _ A R T Y

Now, what about the first guess: 
  - We had R at position 2? But now we know R is at position 3? So the secret word does not have R at position 2? That's consistent.

Also, we know:
  - The secret word does not contain C, N, E (from Guess 1) and does not contain P (from Guess 2).

So the secret word is: [not C,N,E,P] A R T Y

We need to find a letter for the first position? It must be a letter that:
  - Is not C, N, E, P
  - Forms a valid English word with ""ARTY""

What are the possibilities? 
  - We can have: 
        B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be ""ARTY"" + one letter? Actually, the word is ""ARTY"" followed by one letter? 

Common words: 
  - ""PARTY"" we already tried? But that was our guess? We are not the word? 
  - ""ARTY"" is not a word? So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? 

Actually, the word is: ?ARTY

So we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". 

Common words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven't tested D? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? 
  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? 

But also: 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? 
  - ""EARTY""? E is not allowed? 
  - ""FARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""HARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""IARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""JARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

Wait, what about ""DAIRY""? 
  - D is not forbidden? We haven't eliminated D? 
  - ""DAIRY"" is a word? Yes, meaning something that belongs to a dairy? 

But also, ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"", ""LAIRY"" (but not common), ""MAIRY"" (not common), ""RAIRY"" (not common), ""WAIRY"" (not common). 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter must not be one of the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P.

So possible words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> D is allowed? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F is allowed? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H is allowed? 

But wait: in the second guess, we got A(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 4, Y(✓) at position 5. So the word must end with ""ARTY"". 

And we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? 

Also, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that's consistent? 

What about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? 

So the secret word is: [letter]ARTY

What letters can we put at the beginning? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). 

Also, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven't seen D, F, H, etc. 

But note: we haven't tested D, F, H, etc. 

So the candidates are: 
  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? 

But also: are there other words? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

What about ""ARTY"" itself? But that's 5 letters? ""ARTY"" is 5 letters? But we are putting an extra letter? 

Wait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY

We have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". 

But also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
""UARTY""? Not a word? 
""VARTY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". 

However, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? 

But we can try one of these? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence? 

But in the pattern, the first letter is separate? 

So we can try ""DAIRY"". 

But let me double-check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That's consistent? Because A is at position 2? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, '-' is consistent? 

Now, what about the second guess: ""party""? 
  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? 

And T and Y were also ✓? 

So the pattern holds: _ A R T Y

Therefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

But also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? 

Or ""UARTY""? No. 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven't thought of? 

We can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? 

But we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? 

But we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? 

We can try ""HAIRY"" next? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's a change? 

But the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:
  D at position 1? 
  A at position 2? (we know it's correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? 

But note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? 

Similarly, R at position 3? We know it's correct? 

So if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:
  D: ? 
  A: ✓ (position 2)
  R: ✓ (position 3)
  T: ✓ (position 4)
  Y: ✓ (position 5)

So the only unknown is the first letter? 

But we don't have any information about D? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven't used D, F, H? 

So we can choose any? 

But we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

We can try ""dairy"" because it's a common word? 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? 

We can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That's correct? 

And A at position 2? Correct? 

So we are hoping that D is the first letter? 

But if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? 

But we don't have any information about F or H? 

So we can choose ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven't? But we know T is at position 4? 

Similarly, Y at position 5? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we can guess ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

I think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it's common? 

But we don't know? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? 

So we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In Guess 1: 
  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that's consistent? 

R was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: 
  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that's what we have? 

So the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY

We can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". 

But we have no information about D, F, H? 

So we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

So I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? 

But let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? 

So we guess ""dairy"". 

But note: we are on the third guess? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".
3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).

### Strategy:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.

<guess>dairy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 3? because we have R at position 3 in the secret word? But wait, in ""dairy"", R is at position 3? And we got '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position 3? That would be inconsistent because we know R is at position 3? 

Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we have A at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓). So the secret word has A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

But in Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We put D at position 1: x (not in word)
  A at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x (not in word)
  R at position 4: - (in word but not at position 4? because we know R is at position 3? So R should be at position 3? Not 4? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - Actually, we already knew R was at position 3 from Guess 2? So why are we getting '-' for R at position 4? 

This is confusing? 

Let me check the positions:

In the secret word, the positions are:
  Position 1: ? (we don't know)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: T (fixed)
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We have:
    Position 1: D -> x (so D is not the first letter)
    Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
    Position 3: I -> x (I is not in the word)
    Position 4: R -> - (but we know R is at position 3? So this R at position 4 is wrong? And we know R is in the word? So why are we getting '-'? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 is '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we already know R is at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

But then why in ""dairy"" we have R at position 4? And we get '-'? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? But we know it has R at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

So the pattern is fixed: the secret word is [letter] A R T Y

Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that is not C, N, E, P, D, I? (because we have eliminated these letters: C, N, E, P, D, I)

And the word must be a valid English word.

So what are the possibilities? 

We need to find a letter for the first position that makes a valid 5-letter word with ""ARTY"".

Common words: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning?

Also, less common: 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But we have to check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, A is at position 2? So that's consistent? 

And R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> consistent? 

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> we had R at position 4? (but we know R is at position 3? So position 4 is not R? And we get '-' for R at position 4? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? Which is consistent because R is fixed at position 3? 

So the secret word is either ""fairy"" or ""hairy"".

But we have to confirm: 

We know the secret word has R at position 3? So in ""fairy"" and ""hairy"", R is at position 3? 

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, D, I.

So ""fairy"" and ""hairy"" are both possible? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess ""fairy"" next? 

But we have two options? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? 

We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have 4 guesses left? 

So we can do that? 

But we can also try to use a word that tests both possibilities? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

So we must choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> we don't know about F? 
  A (fixed at position 2)
  R (fixed at position 3)
  T (fixed at position 4)
  Y (fixed at position 5)

So if we guess ""fairy"", we are testing F at position 1? 

If F is correct? Then we have the word? 

If F is wrong? Then the word must be ""hairy""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So I'll go with ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already excluded? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- The first letter must be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
- The only common words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Deductions:
1. **FAIRY** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested). 
2. **HAIRY** tests the letter **H** (not previously tested).
3. Neither word contains any excluded letters (C, N, E, P, D, I).

### Strategy:
- Since only the first letter is unknown, we can test one candidate at a time. 
- ""FAIRY"" is a more common word than ""HAIRY"", so it is prioritized.
- If ""FAIRY"" is incorrect, the answer must be ""HAIRY"" (unless uncommon words exist, but ""FAIRY"" is a valid English word).

<guess>fairy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""party"")**: A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2–5. P is absent.
- **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**: A, R, T, Y remain correct in positions 2–5. D and I are absent. 

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A R T Y` (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter **not** in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
3. The only common English words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested).
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.

Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\n But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? \n   However, we must check the positions: \n   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn\'t tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? \n\n However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.\n\n But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn\'t prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a \'-\' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don\'t know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a \'-\' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? \n\n Actually, the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning:\n   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.\n\n So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess?

But note: we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don\'t know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? \n\n But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? \n\n However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Common words: \n   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it\'s not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n We can try:\n   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.\n\n Let me try to list some words:\n\n Option: ""RAPID"" -> \n   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. \n   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). \n\n But we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> \n   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n How about ""TRAIL""? \n   T, R, A, I, L -> \n   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same as before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words:\n\n   ""PARTY"": \n      P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). \n        Positions: \n          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n\n   This seems good: \n        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that\'s a new position and we can test it.\n        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.\n\n   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.\n\n   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.\n\n   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.\n\n   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": \n        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. \n\n   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n   Let me compare:\n      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don\'t know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don\'t know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.\n\n      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.\n\n   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": \n        Position 1: P (new)\n        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)\n        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)\n        Position 4: T (new)\n        Position 5: Y (new)\n\n   This seems efficient.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> \n        S, T, A, M, P -> \n        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.\n\n   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""TAROT""? -> \n        T, A, R, O, T -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n        But it has two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\n   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.\n\n   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> \n        R, A, L, L, Y -> \n        R at position 1? \n        A at position 2? \n        Then L at positions 3 and 4? \n        But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   However, we are testing L.\n\n   But note: we are using two L\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\n   How about ""RAPID""? \n        R, A, P, I, D -> \n        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the secret word has P, I, D.\n\n   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.\n\n   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. \n\n   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven\'t tried and also test new letters.\n\n   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:\n        R at position 1, and A at position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.\n\n   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A\'s? and M? \n        D, R, A, M, A -> \n        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n   So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""HARPY""? \n        H, A, R, P, Y -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? \n        Positions: \n          1: H (new)\n          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)\n          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tried position 3 for R -> good)\n          4: P (new)\n          5: Y (new)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".\n\n   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven\'t tried H, P, Y.\n\n   However, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n   Let me see the frequency: \n        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.\n\n   But we don\'t know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.\n\n   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S\'s? and we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? \n\n   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.\n\n   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.\n\n   So we must avoid N.\n\n   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:\n        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried for A).\n        - It introduces S, P, Y.\n\n   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": \n        P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.\n\n   This seems equally good.\n\n   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.\n\n   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n   So my next guess: ""PARTY""\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n   But note: we are going to get feedback on:\n        P at position 1 -> if it\'s in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.\n        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we\'ll get feedback on whether it\'s at position 2? Or if it\'s elsewhere.\n\n   This is going to give us more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> \n        F, L, A, I, R -> \n        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.\n\n   How about ""ALARM""? -> \n        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? \n\n   We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.\n\n   But we are using two A\'s? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.\n\n   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""PARTY""\n\n   Guess: ""party""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.\n- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.\n2. Exclude C, N, and E.\n3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""party""** because:\n- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).\n- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, not at position 2)\n  A: - (in word, not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). \n  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y\n\nWe know the word is: ? A R T Y\n\nWe also know from Guess 1 that:\n  R is in the word but not at position 2? Actually, in the secret word, R is at position 3? So that\'s consistent? Because in Guess 1, R was at position 2 and we got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Now we see R is at position 3? So that matches.\n\nAdditionally, we know:\n  - The letter A is at position 2? But in Guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got \'-\', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we see A is at position 2? So that\'s a contradiction? Wait, let me reexamine:\n\nIn Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? \nIn Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? \n\nBut the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? \n\nWait, how does that align? \n  - The secret word has A at position 2? \n  - So the word is: _ A R T Y\n\nNow, what about the first guess: \n  - We had R at position 2? But now we know R is at position 3? So the secret word does not have R at position 2? That\'s consistent.\n\nAlso, we know:\n  - The secret word does not contain C, N, E (from Guess 1) and does not contain P (from Guess 2).\n\nSo the secret word is: [not C,N,E,P] A R T Y\n\nWe need to find a letter for the first position? It must be a letter that:\n  - Is not C, N, E, P\n  - Forms a valid English word with ""ARTY""\n\nWhat are the possibilities? \n  - We can have: \n        B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nBut note: the word must be ""ARTY"" + one letter? Actually, the word is ""ARTY"" followed by one letter? \n\nCommon words: \n  - ""PARTY"" we already tried? But that was our guess? We are not the word? \n  - ""ARTY"" is not a word? So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? \n\nActually, the word is: ?ARTY\n\nSo we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". \n\nCommon words: \n  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven\'t tested D? \n  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? \n  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? \n  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? \n\nBut also: \n  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? \n  - ""EARTY""? E is not allowed? \n  - ""FARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""HARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""IARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""JARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? \n\nWait, what about ""DAIRY""? \n  - D is not forbidden? We haven\'t eliminated D? \n  - ""DAIRY"" is a word? Yes, meaning something that belongs to a dairy? \n\nBut also, ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"", ""LAIRY"" (but not common), ""MAIRY"" (not common), ""RAIRY"" (not common), ""WAIRY"" (not common). \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the first letter must not be one of the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P.\n\nSo possible words: \n  - ""DAIRY"" -> D is allowed? \n  - ""FAIRY"" -> F is allowed? \n  - ""HAIRY"" -> H is allowed? \n\nBut wait: in the second guess, we got A(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 4, Y(✓) at position 5. So the word must end with ""ARTY"". \n\nAnd we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? \n\nAlso, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that\'s consistent? \n\nWhat about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? \n\nSo the secret word is: [letter]ARTY\n\nWhat letters can we put at the beginning? \n\nWe know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). \n\nAlso, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven\'t seen D, F, H, etc. \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested D, F, H, etc. \n\nSo the candidates are: \n  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? \n  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? \n  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? \n\nBut also: are there other words? \n  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? \n\nWhat about ""ARTY"" itself? But that\'s 5 letters? ""ARTY"" is 5 letters? But we are putting an extra letter? \n\nWait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY\n\nWe have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". \n\nBut also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? \n""UARTY""? Not a word? \n""VARTY""? Not a word? \n\nAnother possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? \n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". \n\nHowever, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? \n\nBut we can try one of these? \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any evidence? \n\nBut in the pattern, the first letter is separate? \n\nSo we can try ""DAIRY"". \n\nBut let me double-check: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That\'s consistent? Because A is at position 2? \n\nSimilarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, \'-\' is consistent? \n\nNow, what about the second guess: ""party""? \n  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? \n\nAnd T and Y were also ✓? \n\nSo the pattern holds: _ A R T Y\n\nTherefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nBut also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? \n\nOr ""UARTY""? No. \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven\'t thought of? \n\nWe can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? \n\nBut we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? \n\nBut we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? \n\nWe can try ""HAIRY"" next? \n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That\'s a change? \n\nBut the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:\n  D at position 1? \n  A at position 2? (we know it\'s correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? \n\nBut note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? \n\nSimilarly, R at position 3? We know it\'s correct? \n\nSo if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:\n  D: ? \n  A: ✓ (position 2)\n  R: ✓ (position 3)\n  T: ✓ (position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo the only unknown is the first letter? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about D? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven\'t used D, F, H? \n\nSo we can choose any? \n\nBut we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nWe can try ""dairy"" because it\'s a common word? \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? \n\nWe can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me confirm: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That\'s correct? \n\nAnd A at position 2? Correct? \n\nSo we are hoping that D is the first letter? \n\nBut if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut note: we have to make a guess? \n\nAnother candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about F or H? \n\nSo we can choose ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven\'t? But we know T is at position 4? \n\nSimilarly, Y at position 5? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? \n\nSo we can guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nI think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it\'s common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? \n\nSo we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: \n\nIn Guess 1: \n  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that\'s consistent? \n\nR was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? \n\nIn Guess 2: \n  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that\'s what we have? \n\nSo the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY\n\nWe can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". \n\nBut we have no information about D, F, H? \n\nSo we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? \n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nSo I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? \n\nBut let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo we guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are on the third guess? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nTherefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.\n- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).\n2. The first letter must:\n   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).\n   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".\n3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).\n\n### Strategy:\n- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

  - C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""party"" -> P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓), Y(✓)
  - A, R, T, Y are in the word and at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
  - P is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> D(x), A(✓), I(x), R(-), Y(✓)
  - A, R, T, Y are still correct at positions 2,3,4,5.
  - D and I are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not at position 4? Because we got '-' for R at position 4? But we already know R is at position 3? So this means the secret word has R at position 3 and not at position 4? But we already knew that? 

Actually, the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we know from Guess 2 that R is at position 3? So this confirms: R is fixed at position 3? 

But wait, the pattern is: position 3 is R? So in ""dairy"", we have R at position 4? And we got '-' meaning R is not at position 4? Which is consistent? Because we know R is at position 3? 

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

We now know that the first letter is not C, N, E, P, D, I? 

Because we have excluded:
  From Guess 1: C, N, E
  From Guess 2: P
  From Guess 3: D, I

So excluded letters: C, N, E, P, D, I

We have two common candidates: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY""? 

But also: are there others? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word?

  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But note: we have to confirm that these words exist? 

We know the secret word has the pattern: _ A R T Y

And we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at position 1? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at position 1?

We have no further feedback? So we must choose one? 

But we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"", and it's correct? We win? 

If it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have two possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But we can also consider: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we must guess one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> if we get ✓ for F? Then we have the word? 
  A (✓), R (✓), T (✓), Y (✓) -> which will be ✓ if fairy is correct? 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and the word is ""hairy"", then we get:
  F: x (because H is the correct first letter? And we know F is not in the word? Actually, if the word is ""hairy"", then F is not in the word? So we get x for F? And then we know the word must be ""hairy""? 

So we can do that? 

But we have two possibilities? So we choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a more common word? So I'll guess ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid any excluded letters? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word pattern is `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- Excluded letters: **C, N, E, P, D, I** (from previous feedback).
- The only remaining common words are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested) at position 1. 
- If correct, the solution is confirmed. 
- If incorrect, the solution must be ""hairy"" (H at position 1).

- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, D, I (absent from the word).
- **Possible candidates**: Only **FAIRY** and **HAIRY** are common English words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters.

### Strategy:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested) at position 1.
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.

Actually, the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we know from Guess 2 that R is at position 3? So this confirms: R is fixed at position 3? 

But wait, the pattern is: position 3 is R? So in ""dairy"", we have R at position 4? And we got '-' meaning R is not at position 4? Which is consistent? Because we know R is at position 3?

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 06 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R must be in the word but not at position 2. So we can try R in a different position, say position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A must be in the word but not at position 3. So we can try A in a different position.

 We also want to avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and also includes some new common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try putting R at the beginning? Like ""R_____"" but note we don't know the other letters.

 Let's consider common words:

 Option 1: ""ROAST"" -> but we have E? No, we cannot use E. Also, we have S and T which are new.

 But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? 
   However, we must check the positions: 
   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That's allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.

 But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? 

 However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.

 But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn't prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a '-' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don't know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a '-' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? 

 Actually, the feedback for A was '-' meaning:
   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.

 So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it's not there. We can try A in a different position.

 Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.

 So for our next guess, we can try:
   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don't know if R can be at position 1? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

 Let's try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don't know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don't know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? 

 But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? 

 However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Common words: 
   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it's not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 We can try:
   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.

 Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

 Let me try to list some words:

 Option: ""RAPID"" -> 
   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). 

 But we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.

 Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> 
   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.

 How about ""TRAIL""? 
   T, R, A, I, L -> 
   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.

 So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as before? And we know it's not there. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words:

   ""PARTY"": 
      P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). 
        Positions: 
          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)

   This seems good: 
        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that's a new position and we can test it.
        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.

   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.

   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.

   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.

   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": 
        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That's acceptable.

   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. 

   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A's? And we don't know if the secret word has two A's? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.

   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.

   Let me compare:
      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don't know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don't know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.

      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.

   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": 
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)
        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: Y (new)

   This seems efficient.

   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> 
        S, T, A, M, P -> 
        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.

   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""TAROT""? -> 
        T, A, R, O, T -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That's acceptable? 
        But it has two T's? And we don't know if T is in the word.

   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.

   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.

   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? 

   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that's invalid.

   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> 
        R, A, L, L, Y -> 
        R at position 1? 
        A at position 2? 
        Then L at positions 3 and 4? 
        But we don't know if L is in the word.

   However, we are testing L.

   But note: we are using two L's? That might be inefficient.

   How about ""RAPID""? 
        R, A, P, I, D -> 
        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.

   But we don't know if the secret word has P, I, D.

   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.

   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. 

   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don't know.

   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven't tried and also test new letters.

   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:
        R at position 1, and A at position 4? 

   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.

   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A's? and M? 
        D, R, A, M, A -> 
        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

   So we must avoid position 2 for R.

   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.

   How about ""HARPY""? 
        H, A, R, P, Y -> 
        A at position 2? and R at position 3? 
        Positions: 
          1: H (new)
          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)
          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for R -> good)
          4: P (new)
          5: Y (new)

   This is acceptable.

   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".

   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven't tried H, P, Y.

   However, we also want to cover more common letters.

   Let me see the frequency: 
        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.

   But we don't know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.

   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S's? and we don't know if S is in the word.

   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? 

   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.

   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.

   So we must avoid N.

   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:
        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven't tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven't tried for A).
        - It introduces S, P, Y.

   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.

   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": 
        P, A, R, T, Y -> 
        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.

   This seems equally good.

   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are using distinct letters.

   I think I'll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.

   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.

   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.

   So my next guess: ""PARTY""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are going to get feedback on:
        P at position 1 -> if it's in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.
        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we'll get feedback on whether it's at position 2? Or if it's elsewhere.

   This is going to give us more information.

   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.

   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> 
        F, L, A, I, R -> 
        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.

   How about ""ALARM""? -> 
        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.
        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? 

   We don't know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.

   But we are using two A's? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.

   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.

   So I'll go with ""PARTY""

   Guess: ""party""

   We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn't have any of these.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.
- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude C, N, and E.
3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.

I chose **""party""** because:
- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).
- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.

<guess>party</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

From Guess 2:
  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). 
  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y

We know the word is: ? A R T Y

We also know from Guess 1 that:
  R is in the word but not at position 2? Actually, in the secret word, R is at position 3? So that's consistent? Because in Guess 1, R was at position 2 and we got '-', meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Now we see R is at position 3? So that matches.

Additionally, we know:
  - The letter A is at position 2? But in Guess 1, A was at position 3 and we got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we see A is at position 2? So that's a contradiction? Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? 
In Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? 

But the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? 

Wait, how does that align? 
  - The secret word has A at position 2? 
  - So the word is: _ A R T Y

Now, what about the first guess: 
  - We had R at position 2? But now we know R is at position 3? So the secret word does not have R at position 2? That's consistent.

Also, we know:
  - The secret word does not contain C, N, E (from Guess 1) and does not contain P (from Guess 2).

So the secret word is: [not C,N,E,P] A R T Y

We need to find a letter for the first position? It must be a letter that:
  - Is not C, N, E, P
  - Forms a valid English word with ""ARTY""

What are the possibilities? 
  - We can have: 
        B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z

But note: the word must be ""ARTY"" + one letter? Actually, the word is ""ARTY"" followed by one letter? 

Common words: 
  - ""PARTY"" we already tried? But that was our guess? We are not the word? 
  - ""ARTY"" is not a word? So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? 

Actually, the word is: ?ARTY

So we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". 

Common words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven't tested D? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? 
  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? 

But also: 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? 
  - ""EARTY""? E is not allowed? 
  - ""FARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""HARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""IARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""JARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

Wait, what about ""DAIRY""? 
  - D is not forbidden? We haven't eliminated D? 
  - ""DAIRY"" is a word? Yes, meaning something that belongs to a dairy? 

But also, ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"", ""LAIRY"" (but not common), ""MAIRY"" (not common), ""RAIRY"" (not common), ""WAIRY"" (not common). 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter must not be one of the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P.

So possible words: 
  - ""DAIRY"" -> D is allowed? 
  - ""FAIRY"" -> F is allowed? 
  - ""HAIRY"" -> H is allowed? 

But wait: in the second guess, we got A(✓) at position 2, R(✓) at position 3, T(✓) at position 4, Y(✓) at position 5. So the word must end with ""ARTY"". 

And we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? 

Also, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that's consistent? 

What about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? 

So the secret word is: [letter]ARTY

What letters can we put at the beginning? 

We know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). 

Also, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven't seen D, F, H, etc. 

But note: we haven't tested D, F, H, etc. 

So the candidates are: 
  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? 

But also: are there other words? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

What about ""ARTY"" itself? But that's 5 letters? ""ARTY"" is 5 letters? But we are putting an extra letter? 

Wait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY

We have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". 

But also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
""UARTY""? Not a word? 
""VARTY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? 

But note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". 

However, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? 

But we can try one of these? 

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence? 

But in the pattern, the first letter is separate? 

So we can try ""DAIRY"". 

But let me double-check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That's consistent? Because A is at position 2? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, '-' is consistent? 

Now, what about the second guess: ""party""? 
  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? 

And T and Y were also ✓? 

So the pattern holds: _ A R T Y

Therefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

But also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? 

Or ""UARTY""? No. 

But note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven't thought of? 

We can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? 

But we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? 

But we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? 

We can try ""HAIRY"" next? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's a change? 

But the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:
  D at position 1? 
  A at position 2? (we know it's correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? 

But note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? 

Similarly, R at position 3? We know it's correct? 

So if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:
  D: ? 
  A: ✓ (position 2)
  R: ✓ (position 3)
  T: ✓ (position 4)
  Y: ✓ (position 5)

So the only unknown is the first letter? 

But we don't have any information about D? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven't used D, F, H? 

So we can choose any? 

But we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? 

We can try ""dairy"" because it's a common word? 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? 

We can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

But note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me confirm: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That's correct? 

And A at position 2? Correct? 

So we are hoping that D is the first letter? 

But if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? 

But note: we have to make a guess? 

Another candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? 

But we don't have any information about F or H? 

So we can choose ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven't? But we know T is at position 4? 

Similarly, Y at position 5? 

So we can try ""dairy"". 

But let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we can guess ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? 

But we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? 

I think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it's common? 

But we don't know? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? 

So we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

But let me double-check the feedback: 

In Guess 1: 
  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that's consistent? 

R was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: 
  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that's what we have? 

So the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY

We can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". 

But we have no information about D, F, H? 

So we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to make a new guess? 

So I'll go with ""dairy"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven't? So we have to guess? 

So I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? 

But let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? 

So we guess ""dairy"". 

But note: we are on the third guess? 

So the next guess is ""dairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:
- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".
3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).

### Strategy:
- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.

<guess>dairy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""party""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  T: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Guess 3: ""dairy""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  I: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, but not at position 3? because we have R at position 3 in the secret word? But wait, in ""dairy"", R is at position 3? And we got '-' meaning R is in the word but not at position 3? That would be inconsistent because we know R is at position 3? 

Wait, let me reexamine:

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we have A at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓). So the secret word has A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5? 

But in Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We put D at position 1: x (not in word)
  A at position 2: ✓ (correct)
  I at position 3: x (not in word)
  R at position 4: - (in word but not at position 4? because we know R is at position 3? So R should be at position 3? Not 4? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - Actually, we already knew R was at position 3 from Guess 2? So why are we getting '-' for R at position 4? 

This is confusing? 

Let me check the positions:

In the secret word, the positions are:
  Position 1: ? (we don't know)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: T (fixed)
  Position 5: Y (fixed)

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> 
  We have:
    Position 1: D -> x (so D is not the first letter)
    Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
    Position 3: I -> x (I is not in the word)
    Position 4: R -> - (but we know R is at position 3? So this R at position 4 is wrong? And we know R is in the word? So why are we getting '-'? 

Wait, no: the feedback for R in Guess 3 is '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we already know R is at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

But then why in ""dairy"" we have R at position 4? And we get '-'? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? But we know it has R at position 3? So the secret word must have R at position 3? 

So the pattern is fixed: the secret word is [letter] A R T Y

Therefore, the first letter must be a letter that is not C, N, E, P, D, I? (because we have eliminated these letters: C, N, E, P, D, I)

And the word must be a valid English word.

So what are the possibilities? 

We need to find a letter for the first position that makes a valid 5-letter word with ""ARTY"".

Common words: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning?

Also, less common: 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But we have to check: 
  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, A is at position 2? So that's consistent? 

And R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, consistent? 

In Guess 2: ""party"" -> we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> consistent? 

In Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> we had R at position 4? (but we know R is at position 3? So position 4 is not R? And we get '-' for R at position 4? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? Which is consistent because R is fixed at position 3? 

So the secret word is either ""fairy"" or ""hairy"".

But we have to confirm: 

We know the secret word has R at position 3? So in ""fairy"" and ""hairy"", R is at position 3? 

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, D, I.

So ""fairy"" and ""hairy"" are both possible? 

But we have to choose one? 

We can guess ""fairy"" next? 

But we have two options? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? 

We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have 4 guesses left? 

So we can do that? 

But we can also try to use a word that tests both possibilities? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? 

So we must choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> we don't know about F? 
  A (fixed at position 2)
  R (fixed at position 3)
  T (fixed at position 4)
  Y (fixed at position 5)

So if we guess ""fairy"", we are testing F at position 1? 

If F is correct? Then we have the word? 

If F is wrong? Then the word must be ""hairy""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

So I'll go with ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already excluded? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- The first letter must be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
- The only common words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Deductions:
1. **FAIRY** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested). 
2. **HAIRY** tests the letter **H** (not previously tested).
3. Neither word contains any excluded letters (C, N, E, P, D, I).

### Strategy:
- Since only the first letter is unknown, we can test one candidate at a time. 
- ""FAIRY"" is a more common word than ""HAIRY"", so it is prioritized.
- If ""FAIRY"" is incorrect, the answer must be ""HAIRY"" (unless uncommon words exist, but ""FAIRY"" is a valid English word).

<guess>fairy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""party"")**: A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2–5. P is absent.
- **Guess 3 (""dairy"")**: A, R, T, Y remain correct in positions 2–5. D and I are absent. 

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[?] A R T Y` (positions 2–5 are confirmed).
2. The first letter must:
   - Be a valid English letter **not** in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).
3. The only common English words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested).
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.

<guess>fairy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓)
Guess 4: fairy -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
  - R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively.
  - C, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""party"" -> P(x), A(✓), R(✓), T(✓), Y(✓)
  - A, R, T, Y are in the word and at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.
  - P is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> D(x), A(✓), I(x), R(-), Y(✓)
  - A, R, T, Y are still correct at positions 2,3,4,5.
  - D and I are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not at position 4? Because we got '-' for R at position 4? But we already know R is at position 3? So this means the secret word has R at position 3 and not at position 4? But we already knew that? 

Actually, the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we know from Guess 2 that R is at position 3? So this confirms: R is fixed at position 3? 

But wait, the pattern is: position 3 is R? So in ""dairy"", we have R at position 4? And we got '-' meaning R is not at position 4? Which is consistent? Because we know R is at position 3? 

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

We now know that the first letter is not C, N, E, P, D, I? 

Because we have excluded:
  From Guess 1: C, N, E
  From Guess 2: P
  From Guess 3: D, I

So excluded letters: C, N, E, P, D, I

We have two common candidates: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY""? 

But also: are there others? 
  - ""OARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""MARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""GARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""KARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""LARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""QARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""SARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""WARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? 
  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? 

So only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? 

But note: we have to confirm that these words exist? 

We know the secret word has the pattern: _ A R T Y

And we have two strong candidates: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at position 1? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at position 1?

We have no further feedback? So we must choose one? 

But we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? 

So we can guess ""fairy"". 

But if we guess ""fairy"", and it's correct? We win? 

If it's wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? 

But we have two possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? We haven't? So we can choose either? 

But we can also consider: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one letter missing? 

So we must guess one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I'll go with that? 

But let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That's fixed? 

Similarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? 

So ""fairy"" is: 
  F (new) -> if we get ✓ for F? Then we have the word? 
  A (✓), R (✓), T (✓), Y (✓) -> which will be ✓ if fairy is correct? 

But if we guess ""fairy"" and the word is ""hairy"", then we get:
  F: x (because H is the correct first letter? And we know F is not in the word? Actually, if the word is ""hairy"", then F is not in the word? So we get x for F? And then we know the word must be ""hairy""? 

So we can do that? 

But we have two possibilities? So we choose one? 

I think ""fairy"" is a more common word? So I'll guess ""fairy"". 

But note: we have to avoid any excluded letters? We haven't excluded F? 

So the next guess is ""fairy"". 

Therefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:
- The secret word pattern is `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).
- Excluded letters: **C, N, E, P, D, I** (from previous feedback).
- The only remaining common words are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.

### Next Guess:
- **""fairy""** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested) at position 1. 
- If correct, the solution is confirmed. 
- If incorrect, the solution must be ""hairy"" (H at position 1).

<guess>fairy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 are fixed as **A**, **R**, **T**, **Y**).
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, D, I (absent from the word).
- **Possible candidates**: Only **FAIRY** and **HAIRY** are common English words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters.

### Strategy:
- **""fairy""** is prioritized because:
  - It tests the letter **F** (not previously tested) at position 1.
  - It is a more common word than ""hairy"".
  - If incorrect, ""hairy"" (with H at position 1) will be the next logical guess.

Also, we have S and T which are new.\n\n But wait: ""roast"" has O, A, S, T? And R at the start. However, we have to avoid E, which we are. But note: we also know that the word does not have C, N, E. So ""roast"" is acceptable? \n   However, we must check the positions: \n   In ""crane"", R was at position 2 and now in ""roast"" R is at position 1. That\'s allowed because the feedback only said R is not at position 2.\n\n But wait: the feedback for R was (-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn\'t tell us about position 1. So we can try R at position 1? \n\n However, we also have A in ""crane"" at position 3. In ""roast"", A is at position 3? That would be the same position. But the feedback said A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback was for the third letter (A) of ""crane"" being not correct. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""roast"", A is at position 3? Then we should avoid putting A at position 3 again? Actually, we can try a different position.\n\n But note: we are allowed to put A at position 3 again? The feedback only said that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. It doesn\'t prevent us from putting A at position 3 in our next guess? However, if we put A at position 3 again, and if the secret word has A at a different position, then we might get a \'-\' again? But we already know A is not at position 3? Actually, we don\'t know that for sure: the feedback only told us that in the word ""crane"", the A at position 3 was wrong. But the secret word might have A at position 3? Wait, no: because if the secret word had A at position 3, then in ""crane"" we would have had a ✓ for A at position 3. But we had a \'-\' meaning that A is in the word but not at that position. So the secret word does not have A at position 3? \n\n Actually, the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning:\n   - The letter A is in the word, but not at the third position.\n\n So we should avoid putting A at position 3 in our next guess? Because we know it\'s not there. We can try A in a different position.\n\n Similarly, we know R is not at position 2.\n\n So for our next guess, we can try:\n   R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note: we don\'t know if R can be at position 1? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n   We can try ""RADIO"" -> but that has D, I, O and also A at position 2? And R at position 1. But we don\'t know if D, I, O are in the word? Also, we have to avoid E? Yes.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Another idea: ""PARTY"" -> has P, A, R, T, Y. But we don\'t know about P, T, Y. Also, A is at position 2? and R at position 3? \n\n But note: we must avoid the letters that are not in the word: C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable? \n\n However, we have two letters we know: R and A. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has R and A and also includes other common consonants and vowels.\n\n Common words: \n   ""ROAST"" -> R at 1, A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid putting A at position 3? Because we already know it\'s not there. So we can try ""ROAST"" but then A is at position 3? That would be a waste because we know A is not at position 3.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n We can try:\n   A at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? and R at position 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\n Also, we want to avoid using the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.\n\n Let me try to list some words:\n\n Option: ""RAPID"" -> \n   R at 1, A at 2, P, I, D. \n   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). \n\n But we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""BRAVE"" -> \n   B, R, A, V, E -> but E is not allowed? We know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""BRAVE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n How about ""TRAIL""? \n   T, R, A, I, L -> \n   R is at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2? Because we already know that position 2 is not R.\n\n So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, in ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same as before? And we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""RAIL""? -> 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words:\n\n   ""PARTY"": \n      P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        R is at position 3? (which is new) and A is at position 2? (which is new for A). \n        Positions: \n          P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n\n   This seems good: \n        R was in position 2 in the first guess and now we are putting it at position 3 -> that\'s a new position and we can test it.\n        A was in position 3 in the first guess, now we put it at position 2 -> a new position.\n\n   Also, we are introducing P, T, Y.\n\n   But note: we are not using the fact that we know R and A are in the word? Yes, we are.\n\n   However, we must check if the word is valid: ""party"" is a valid English word.\n\n   But wait: we also know that the secret word does not have C, N, E. So ""party"" is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RASPY"": \n        R at 1, A at 2, S, P, Y -> but then A is at position 2? and R at position 1? That\'s acceptable.\n\n   But note: we are trying to get as much information as possible. Using ""party"" uses the letters: P, A, R, T, Y. \n\n   Another alternative: ""RADAR"" -> but that has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? Also, we have R at position 1 and 4? and A at position 2 and 4? That might be confusing.\n\n   We want to maximize the number of new letters we test.\n\n   Let me compare:\n      ""PARTY"": tests P, A, R, T, Y -> but we already know A and R? Actually, we don\'t know the positions of R and A? We know they are in the word, but we don\'t know the positions. So we are testing two new positions for R and A.\n\n      ""RASPY"": tests R, A, S, P, Y -> same idea.\n\n   But note: we also have the constraint that R cannot be at position 2? And in ""party"": \n        Position 1: P (new)\n        Position 2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3? Now we try at position 2 -> good)\n        Position 3: R (we know R is in the word, but not at position 2 -> now we try at position 3 -> good)\n        Position 4: T (new)\n        Position 5: Y (new)\n\n   This seems efficient.\n\n   However, we must consider: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""STAMP"" -> \n        S, T, A, M, P -> \n        A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we should avoid that.\n\n   So ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""TAROT""? -> \n        T, A, R, O, T -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? That\'s acceptable? \n        But it has two T\'s? And we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\n   However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n   But note: we have only 5 letters to work with.\n\n   Let me choose ""RASPY"" because it has S and P which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have two vowels? Actually, A and Y? \n\n   Alternatively, we can choose ""RAISE"" -> but we cannot use E? So that\'s invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""RALLY"" -> \n        R, A, L, L, Y -> \n        R at position 1? \n        A at position 2? \n        Then L at positions 3 and 4? \n        But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\n   However, we are testing L.\n\n   But note: we are using two L\'s? That might be inefficient.\n\n   How about ""RAPID""? \n        R, A, P, I, D -> \n        R at 1, A at 2 -> acceptable.\n\n   But we don\'t know if the secret word has P, I, D.\n\n   I think ""RASPY"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters S, P, and Y.\n\n   However, let me check: we know the secret word has R and A. We are putting R at position 1 and A at position 2. \n\n   But what if the secret word has R at position 1 and A at position 2? Then we get two ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to put R and A in positions we haven\'t tried and also test new letters.\n\n   Another idea: we know R is not at position 2 and A is not at position 3. So we can try:\n        R at position 1, and A at position 4? \n\n   Example: ""CRAMP"" -> but C is not allowed? We know C is not in the word.\n\n   How about ""DRAMA""? -> but that has two A\'s? and M? \n        D, R, A, M, A -> \n        R at position 2? But we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n   So we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n   Therefore, in ""DRAMA"", R is at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n   How about ""HARPY""? \n        H, A, R, P, Y -> \n        A at position 2? and R at position 3? \n        Positions: \n          1: H (new)\n          2: A (we know A is in the word, but not at position 3 -> now we try at position 2 -> good)\n          3: R (we know R is in the word, and we haven\'t tried position 3 for R -> good)\n          4: P (new)\n          5: Y (new)\n\n   This is acceptable.\n\n   But we have two candidates: ""RASPY"", ""PARTY"", ""HARPY"".\n\n   I think ""HARPY"" is a good choice because it uses H, A, R, P, Y. We haven\'t tried H, P, Y.\n\n   However, we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n   Let me see the frequency: \n        In English, S is very common. So ""RASPY"" has S and P.\n\n   But we don\'t know if S is in the word? So maybe we should include S.\n\n   How about ""RASPS""? -> but that has two S\'s? and we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n   Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not a word? \n\n   Another word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is at position 3? No, we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid A at position 3.\n\n   How about ""ROBIN""? -> but N is not allowed? We know N is not in the word.\n\n   So we must avoid N.\n\n   After considering, I think ""RASPY"" is a good choice because:\n        - It has R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried) and A at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried for A).\n        - It introduces S, P, Y.\n\n   But note: we are using Y? That might be less common.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PARTY"": \n        P, A, R, T, Y -> \n        A at position 2? (new) and R at position 3? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: P, A, R, T, Y -> all new except A and R? Actually, we are testing R at position 3 and A at position 2.\n\n   This seems equally good.\n\n   However, we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are using distinct letters.\n\n   I think I\'ll go with ""PARTY"" because it uses P, T, Y which are common.\n\n   But wait: we have already eliminated C, N, E. So we have 21 letters left? Actually, 26 - 5 = 21? But we are using 5: P, A, R, T, Y.\n\n   Let me check if ""party"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n   So my next guess: ""PARTY""\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n   But note: we are going to get feedback on:\n        P at position 1 -> if it\'s in the word and if so, whether at position 1 or not.\n        A at position 2 -> we know A is in the word, so we\'ll get feedback on whether it\'s at position 2? Or if it\'s elsewhere.\n\n   This is going to give us more information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try ""RAINS"" -> but N is not allowed? So invalid.\n\n   Another word: ""FLAIR"" -> \n        F, L, A, I, R -> \n        A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3? So we avoid.\n\n   How about ""ALARM""? -> \n        A at position 1? (new) and R at position 4? (new) -> acceptable.\n        Letters: A, L, A, R, M -> duplicate A? \n\n   We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters? So we can try.\n\n   But we are using two A\'s? That might be confusing? Also, we are testing L and M.\n\n   I think ""party"" is a solid choice.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""PARTY""\n\n   Guess: ""party""\n\n   We\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\n   But note: we must not use the forbidden letters: C, N, E. ""party"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""party"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, N, and E are **not** in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but **not** in position 2.\n- A is in the word but **not** in position 3.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing R at position 2 or A at position 3.\n2. Exclude C, N, and E.\n3. Test new common letters (e.g., P, T, Y) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""party""** because:\n- It places R at position 3 (a new position for R) and A at position 2 (a new position for A).\n- It introduces three new common letters: P, T, and Y.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and positions (R not at 2, A not at 3).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing new letters.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, not at position 2)\n  A: - (in word, not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  T: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n  A is at position 2 (✓), R at position 3 (✓), T at position 4 (✓), Y at position 5 (✓). \n  This means the secret word has the form: _ A R T Y\n\nWe know the word is: ?

Wait, let me reexamine:\n\nIn Guess 1: ""crane"" -> A was at position 3? \nIn Guess 2: ""party"" -> A is at position 2? \n\nBut the feedback for Guess 1 said A is in the word but not at position 3? So we thought A must be at position 1,4, or 5? But now we have A at position 2? \n\nWait, how does that align? \n  - The secret word has A at position 2? \n  - So the word is: _ A R T Y\n\nNow, what about the first guess: \n  - We had R at position 2?

So we need a word that starts with an letter and then ""ARTY""? \n\nActually, the word is: ?ARTY\n\nSo we are looking for words that end with ""ARTY""? But note: the pattern is: first letter + ""ARTY"". \n\nCommon words: \n  - ""DAIRY"" -> but we know D? We haven\'t tested D? \n  - ""FAIRY"" -> F? \n  - ""HAIRY"" -> H? \n  - ""LAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""MAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""RAIRY""? Not a word? \n  - ""WAIRY""? Not a word? \n\nBut also: \n  - ""BARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""CARTY""? C is not allowed? \n  - ""EARTY""?

So the word must end with ""ARTY"". \n\nAnd we know the first letter cannot be C, N, E, P? \n\nAlso, we know from Guess 1: the letter R was present? But now we have R at position 3? So that\'s consistent? \n\nWhat about the first guess: A was at position 3? But now we have A at position 2? \n\nSo the secret word is: [letter]ARTY\n\nWhat letters can we put at the beginning? \n\nWe know the word does not contain: C, N, E, P (from previous feedback). \n\nAlso, we have to avoid: any letter that we have seen and know is not present? We haven\'t seen D, F, H, etc. \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested D, F, H, etc. \n\nSo the candidates are: \n  - ""DAIRY"": D at the beginning? \n  - ""FAIRY"": F at the beginning? \n  - ""HAIRY"": H at the beginning? \n\nBut also: are there other words? \n  - ""WARTY""?

But we are putting an extra letter? \n\nWait, the word is: first letter + ""ARTY"". So the word must be: [letter]ARTY\n\nWe have ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", ""HAIRY"". \n\nBut also: ""OARTY""? Not a word? \n""UARTY""? Not a word? \n""VARTY""? Not a word? \n\nAnother possibility: ""WARTY""? Not a word? \n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might be ""DAIRY"", ""FAIRY"", or ""HAIRY"". \n\nHowever, we have only 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses? So we have 4 more? \n\nBut we can try one of these? \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any evidence? \n\nBut in the pattern, the first letter is separate? \n\nSo we can try ""DAIRY"". \n\nBut let me double-check: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, if it is ""dairy"", then A is at position 2? So in ""crane"", A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? That\'s consistent? Because A is at position 2? \n\nSimilarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, \'-\' is consistent? \n\nNow, what about the second guess: ""party""? \n  We had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that matches the pattern? \n\nAnd T and Y were also ✓? \n\nSo the pattern holds: _ A R T Y\n\nTherefore, the secret word is one of: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nBut also: what about ""OARTY""? No, not a word? \n\nOr ""UARTY""? No. \n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the first letter might be a letter we haven\'t thought of? \n\nWe can try ""DAIRY"" as a guess? \n\nBut we want to be efficient? We have three possibilities? We can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? \n\nBut we know the forbidden letters: C, N, E, P. So D, F, H are all possible? \n\nWe can try ""HAIRY"" next? \n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That\'s a change? \n\nBut the word ""dairy"" has A at position 2? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are testing:\n  D at position 1? \n  A at position 2? (we know it\'s correct? Actually, we already know A is at position 2? So we expect ✓ for A? But wait, in the pattern? \n\nBut note: the feedback for A in Guess 1 was \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we are putting A at position 2? So we should get ✓? \n\nSimilarly, R at position 3? We know it\'s correct? \n\nSo if we guess ""dairy"", we can expect:\n  D: ? \n  A: ✓ (position 2)\n  R: ✓ (position 3)\n  T: ✓ (position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo the only unknown is the first letter? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about D? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present? We haven\'t used D, F, H? \n\nSo we can choose any? \n\nBut we have three candidates: DAIRY, FAIRY, HAIRY? \n\nWe can try ""dairy"" because it\'s a common word? \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Or ""hairy""? \n\nWe can also consider: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nBut note: we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we already know the last four letters? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me confirm: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had R at position 2? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So when we guess ""dairy"", we are putting R at position 3? That\'s correct? \n\nAnd A at position 2? Correct? \n\nSo we are hoping that D is the first letter? \n\nBut if we are wrong? Then we get feedback? \n\nBut note: we have to make a guess? \n\nAnother candidate: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are also possible? \n\nBut we don\'t have any information about F or H? \n\nSo we can choose ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested the letter T? We haven\'t? But we know T is at position 4? \n\nSimilarly, Y at position 5? \n\nSo we can try ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me check: the word ""dairy"" is valid? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are not sure? But we have to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter missing? \n\nSo we can guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""hairy""? Then we get it wrong? \n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? So we can try one? \n\nI think ""dairy"" is a good guess because it\'s common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that has the last four letters fixed? But we already have them? \n\nSo we must guess a word that ends with ""ARTY"" and has a first letter that is not C, N, E, P? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nBut let me double-check the feedback: \n\nIn Guess 1: \n  ""crane"": A was at position 3? And we got \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3? Now we have A at position 2? So that\'s consistent? \n\nR was at position 2? But now we have R at position 3? So again, consistent? \n\nIn Guess 2: \n  ""party"": we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> that\'s what we have? \n\nSo the secret word is: [first letter]ARTY\n\nWe can try ""dairy"", ""fairy"", or ""hairy"". \n\nBut we have no information about D, F, H? \n\nSo we choose ""dairy"" as the next guess? \n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""dairy"". \n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""fairy""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested any letter that might be the first letter? We haven\'t? So we have to guess? \n\nSo I think ""dairy"" is the best guess? \n\nBut let me check: is ""dairy"" a valid word? Yes? \n\nSo we guess ""dairy"". \n\nBut note: we are on the third guess? \n\nSo the next guess is ""dairy"". \n\nTherefore, the guess is ""dairy"".Based on the feedback:\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""): R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively. C, N, E are absent.\n- From Guess 2 (""party""): A, R, T, Y are correct and in positions 2, 3, 4, 5. P is absent.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R T Y` (since A, R, T, Y are confirmed at positions 2–5).\n2. The first letter must:\n   - Be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P} (excluded from previous feedback).\n   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""ARTY"".\n3. Possible candidates: **DAIRY**, **FAIRY**, **HAIRY** (common words fitting the pattern, excluding options with forbidden letters (e.g., ""OARTY"" or ""UARTY"" are invalid).\n\n### Strategy:\n- With only the first letter unknown, the most efficient approach is to test a plausible candidate. ""DAIRY"" is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and narrow to FAIRY or HAIRY in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>dairy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: dairy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(x) R(-) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, but not at position 2)\n  A: - (in word, but not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n  P: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct at position 3)\n  T: ✓ (correct at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)\n\nGuess 3: ""dairy""\n  D: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct at position 2)\n  I: x (not in word)\n  R: - (in word, but not at position 3? because we have R at position 3 in the secret word?

Not a word? \n  - ""UARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""VARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""XARTY""? Not a word? \n  - ""ZARTY""? Not a word? \n\nSo only ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY"" are common? \n\nBut we have to check: \n  In Guess 1: ""crane"" -> we had A at position 3? But in the secret word, A is at position 2? So that\'s consistent? \n\nAnd R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But in the secret word, R is at position 3? So again, consistent? \n\nIn Guess 2: ""party"" -> we had A at position 2? (✓) and R at position 3? (✓) -> consistent? \n\nIn Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> we had R at position 4? (but we know R is at position 3? So position 4 is not R? And we get \'-\' for R at position 4? That means the secret word does not have R at position 4? Which is consistent because R is fixed at position 3? \n\nSo the secret word is either ""fairy"" or ""hairy"".\n\nBut we have to confirm: \n\nWe know the secret word has R at position 3? So in ""fairy"" and ""hairy"", R is at position 3? \n\nAlso, we know the secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, D, I.\n\nSo ""fairy"" and ""hairy"" are both possible? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nWe can guess ""fairy"" next? \n\nBut we have two options? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: have we tested F or H? \n\nWe haven\'t? So we can choose either? \n\nBut note: we have 3 guesses left? (after this one? \n\nSo we can guess ""fairy"". \n\nBut if we guess ""fairy"" and it\'s wrong? Then we know it must be ""hairy""? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? \n\nSo we can do that? \n\nBut we can also try to use a word that tests both possibilities? But we don\'t have a word that fits the pattern and tests both? \n\nSo we must choose one? \n\nI think ""fairy"" is a common word? So I\'ll go with that? \n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3? And now we have A at position 2? That\'s fixed? \n\nSimilarly, R was at position 2 in ""crane""? But now we have R at position 3? \n\nSo ""fairy"" is: \n  F (new) -> we don\'t know about F? \n  A (fixed at position 2)\n  R (fixed at position 3)\n  T (fixed at position 4)\n  Y (fixed at position 5)\n\nSo if we guess ""fairy"", we are testing F at position 1? \n\nIf F is correct? Then we have the word? \n\nIf F is wrong? Then the word must be ""hairy""? \n\nBut we have to make a guess? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""fairy"". \n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters that are already excluded? We haven\'t excluded F? \n\nSo the next guess is ""fairy"". \n\nTherefore, the guess is ""fairy"".Based on the feedback:\n- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ A R T Y` (positions 2–5 confirmed).\n- The first letter must be a valid English letter not in {C, N, E, P, D, I} (excluded from previous feedback).\n- The only common words fitting this pattern are **FAIRY** and **HAIRY**.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **FAIRY** tests the letter **F** (not previously tested). \n2. **HAIRY** tests the letter **H** (not previously tested).\n3. Neither word contains any excluded letters (C, N, E, P, D, I).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Since only the first letter is unknown, we can test one candidate at a time. \n- ""FAIRY"" is a more common word than ""HAIRY"", so it is prioritized.\n- If ""FAIRY"" is incorrect, the answer must be ""HAIRY"" (unless uncommon words exist, but ""FAIRY"" is a valid English word).\n\n<guess>fairy</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R and A are in the word, but not at positions 2 and 3 respectively.

  - P is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""dairy"" -> D(x), A(✓), I(x), R(-), Y(✓)
  - A, R, T, Y remain correct at positions 2,3,4,5.
  - D and I are not in the word.
  - R is in the word but not at position 4? Because we got '-' for R at position 4? But we already know R is at position 3? So this means the secret word has R at position 3 and not at position 4? But we already knew that? 

Actually, the feedback for R in Guess 3 was '-' meaning:
  - The letter R is in the word, but not at position 4? 
  - But we know from Guess 2 that R is at position 3? So this confirms: R is fixed at position 3? 

But wait, the pattern is: position 3 is R? So in ""dairy"", we have R at position 4? And we get '-' meaning R is not at position 4? Which is consistent? Because R is at position 3? 

So the secret word is: [letter] A R T Y

We know the first letter cannot be: C, N, E, P, D, I? 

Because we have excluded these letters? 

So excluded letters: C, N, E, P, D, I

We have two common candidates: ""FAIRY"" and ""HAIRY""? 

But note: we have to confirm that these words exist? 

We know the word must be: _ A R T Y

So the first letter must be a letter that forms a valid English word? 

We can list possible first letters? 

Excluded letters: C, N, E, P, D, I

So available letters: A, B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But note: Y is at position 5? So if we put Y at position 1? But we have Y at position 5? So the word would be ""Y A R T Y""? That's not a word? 

Similarly, we cannot have Y at position 1? Because then the word would be ""YARTY""? Which is not a word? 

So the first letter must be a consonant? 

Common words: 
  - ""FAIRY"": F at position 1? 
  - ""HAIRY"": H at position 1?
