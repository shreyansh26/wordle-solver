 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we avoid those.

 Common vowels: We know A is in the word. Other vowels could be I, O, U (but note that E is out).
 Common consonants: We can use S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't say that the word must have distinct letters, but in practice, Wordle words often have distinct letters. However, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters. But for now, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 But in our case, we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and we know A is present. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can try to pick a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position (but not third).

 Also, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A already known, but we want to test new letters.
 - Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has E which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new) -> but note: we don't know if O, U, B, etc. are in the word.
 - A in the second position: e.g., ""PASTA"" (but has S, T, and two A's) -> but we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's try to pick a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3) and includes other common letters.

 Idea: ""PASTA"" is 5 letters, but it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, it uses P, A, S, T, A. But we know A is in the word, so we can test P, S, T.

 But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in ""PASTA"" would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters to get clearer feedback.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and 4 other new letters, all distinct and avoiding C, R, N, E.

 Example: ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, and A in the third position? Wait, we cannot put A in the third position because we know that in the first guess (position 3) was A and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But we can try A in a different position.

 How about ""PASTY""? But that has S, T, Y and A. But note: we don't know about S, T, Y. Also, A is in the second position? Let's check: 
 P A S T Y -> A is at position 2.

 But wait, we have to avoid E, which we are. Also, no C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is not possible because it has E.

 Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but has O and L, but also N (which we know is eliminated) -> so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try: ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y. A is at position 2. This avoids C, R, N, E.

 But is ""PALSY"" a valid word? Yes, it means a friend or companion.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. A at position 2. Avoids C, R, N, E.

 However, we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another common word: ""OASIS"" -> but has two S's and A at position 2. But we don't know about O, S, I.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the number of new letters.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:
 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's and we don't know if two A's exist. Also, A is at position 2 and 4? Actually: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D. But we know A is in the word, so we test S, L, D and the two A's? But the feedback might be confusing.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with A in position 1: 
   A _ _ _ _ 
 Without C, R, N, E.

 Examples: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that's good.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.

 So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y, but that's okay.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn't have two A's. But we can try.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

 Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:
   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it's not at 1 either).
   - It introduces B, O, U, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.

 How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.

 Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.

 Positions for A: we haven't tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.

 We can try:
   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)
   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)
   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an 'x' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be 'x' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as 'x' because it's not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an 'x' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.

 However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be 'x'. So we can avoid that.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's avoid position 3.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven't tested any of these letters.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.

 Which one is better? Both are good.

 Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.

 We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an 'x' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it's in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn't get information about position 2 until we test.

 Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also tests other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 So let's go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.

The word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.

<guess>audio</guess>",audio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)

 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that's good.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.

 So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y, but that's okay.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn't have two A's. But we can try.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

 Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:
   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it's not at 1 either).
   - It introduces B, O, U, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.

 How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.

 Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.

 Positions for A: we haven't tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.

 We can try:
   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)
   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)
   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an 'x' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be 'x' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as 'x' because it's not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an 'x' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.

 However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be 'x'. So we can avoid that.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's avoid position 3.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven't tested any of these letters.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.

 Which one is better? Both are good.

 Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.

 We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an 'x' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it's in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn't get information about position 2 until we test.

 Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also tests other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 So let's go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.

The word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.",Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we avoid those.

 Common vowels: We know A is in the word. Other vowels could be I, O, U (but note that E is out).
 Common consonants: We can use S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't say that the word must have distinct letters, but in practice, Wordle words often have distinct letters. However, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters. But for now, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 But in our case, we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and we know A is present. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can try to pick a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position (but not third).

 Also, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A already known, but we want to test new letters.
 - Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has E which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new) -> but note: we don't know if O, U, B, etc. are in the word.
 - A in the second position: e.g., ""PASTA"" (but has S, T, and two A's) -> but we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's try to pick a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3) and includes other common letters.

 Idea: ""PASTA"" is 5 letters, but it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, it uses P, A, S, T, A. But we know A is in the word, so we can test P, S, T.

 But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in ""PASTA"" would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters to get clearer feedback.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and 4 other new letters, all distinct and avoiding C, R, N, E.

 Example: ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, and A in the third position? Wait, we cannot put A in the third position because we know that in the first guess (position 3) was A and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But we can try A in a different position.

 How about ""PASTY""? But that has S, T, Y and A. But note: we don't know about S, T, Y. Also, A is in the second position? Let's check: 
 P A S T Y -> A is at position 2.

 But wait, we have to avoid E, which we are. Also, no C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is not possible because it has E.

 Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but has O and L, but also N (which we know is eliminated) -> so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try: ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y. A is at position 2. This avoids C, R, N, E.

 But is ""PALSY"" a valid word? Yes, it means a friend or companion.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. A at position 2. Avoids C, R, N, E.

 However, we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another common word: ""OASIS"" -> but has two S's and A at position 2. But we don't know about O, S, I.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the number of new letters.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:
 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's and we don't know if two A's exist. Also, A is at position 2 and 4? Actually: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D. But we know A is in the word, so we test S, L, D and the two A's? But the feedback might be confusing.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with A in position 1: 
   A _ _ _ _ 
 Without C, R, N, E.

 Examples: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that's good.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.

 So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y, but that's okay.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn't have two A's. But we can try.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

 Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:
   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it's not at 1 either).
   - It introduces B, O, U, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.

 How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.

 Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.

 Positions for A: we haven't tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.

 We can try:
   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)
   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)
   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an 'x' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be 'x' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as 'x' because it's not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an 'x' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.

 However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be 'x'. So we can avoid that.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's avoid position 3.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven't tested any of these letters.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.

 Which one is better? Both are good.

 Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.

 We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an 'x' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it's in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn't get information about position 2 until we test.

 Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also tests other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 So let's go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.

The word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.

Actually, the rules don\'t say that the word must have distinct letters, but in practice, Wordle words often have distinct letters. However, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters. But for now, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\n But in our case, we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and we know A is present. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n We can try to pick a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position (but not third).\n\n Also, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have A already known, but we want to test new letters.\n - Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has E which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E, so let\'s avoid any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n - A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new) -> but note: we don\'t know if O, U, B, etc. are in the word.\n - A in the second position: e.g., ""PASTA"" (but has S, T, and two A\'s) -> but we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s try to pick a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried (so not position 3) and includes other common letters.\n\n Idea: ""PASTA"" is 5 letters, but it has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, it uses P, A, S, T, A. But we know A is in the word, so we can test P, S, T.\n\n But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in ""PASTA"" would get an \'x\'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it\'s in the word) and the second A might be marked as \'x\' if the word doesn\'t have two A\'s.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters to get clearer feedback.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has A and 4 other new letters, all distinct and avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\n Example: ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, and A in the third position? Wait, we cannot put A in the third position because we know that in the first guess (position 3) was A and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But we can try A in a different position.\n\n How about ""PASTY""? But that has S, T, Y and A. But note: we don\'t know about S, T, Y. Also, A is in the second position? Let\'s check: \n P A S T Y -> A is at position 2.\n\n But wait, we have to avoid E, which we are. Also, no C, R, N.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is not possible because it has E.\n\n Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but has O and L, but also N (which we know is eliminated) -> so we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n Let me try: ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y. A is at position 2. This avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n But is ""PALSY"" a valid word? Yes, it means a friend or companion.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. A at position 2. Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n However, we don\'t know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""OASIS"" -> but has two S\'s and A at position 2. But we don\'t know about O, S, I.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the number of new letters.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:\n - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A\'s and we don\'t know if two A\'s exist. Also, A is at position 2 and 4? Actually: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D. But we know A is in the word, so we test S, L, D and the two A\'s? But the feedback might be confusing.\n\n Alternatively, ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Therefore, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to form a word with A in position 1: \n   A _ _ _ _ \n Without C, R, N, E.\n\n Examples: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. \n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.\n\n ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that\'s good.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.\n\n So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.\n\n How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.\n\n ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has Y, but that\'s okay.\n\n However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.\n\n How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn\'t have two A\'s. But we can try.\n\n But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)\n\n But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don\'t know. We just know it\'s not in position 3.\n\n Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it\'s correct.\n\n But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.\n\n However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:\n   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it\'s not at 1 either).\n   - It introduces B, O, U, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.\n\n Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don\'t know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.\n\n Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we must include A.\n\n Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.\n\n Positions for A: we haven\'t tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n We can try:\n   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)\n   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)\n   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an \'x\' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be \'x\' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as \'x\' because it\'s not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an \'x\' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.\n\n However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be \'x\'. So we can avoid that.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven\'t tested any of these letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.\n\n Which one is better? Both are good.\n\n Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.\n\n We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an \'x\' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it\'s in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn\'t get information about position 2 until we test.\n\n Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also tests other common letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\n If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test U, D, I, O.\n\n So let\'s go with ""AUDIO"".\n\n But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".\n\n<guess>audio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.\n- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n\nThis guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since it was in position 1 and got ""-""]
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4? Because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter)
- O: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The letter I is in the word and is in the correct position. That position is the fourth letter (because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter and got a check).

2. The letter A is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is now known to be I. So A cannot be in position 4 because that letter is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.

3. We have eliminated the following letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from both guesses: all marked x).

4. We know that the word contains A and I (with I in position 4) and the letters we haven't tested yet.

Now, let's list the knowns:
- Position 4: I
- A is in the word, but not in pos 1,3,4 -> so must be in 2 or 5.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have I in position 4 (because we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Must include A, but in position 2 or 5 (since it can't be in 1,3,4).
- Avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Additionally, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,U,D,I,O. So eliminated: C,R,N,E,U,D,O.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know A is in the word and I is in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ I _

And A must be in position 2 or 5.

We can consider two cases: A in position 2 or A in position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to test both possibilities by including A in one of them and testing other letters for the remaining positions.

However, we must keep in mind that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2).

Let me think of words that have I in the fourth position and A in either position 2 or 5.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> pattern: _ A _ I _
Case 2: A in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ I A

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern, so we might choose a word that has A in position 5 to test that case? Or position 2?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that might be hard.

We can also consider that if we put A in position 5, then we can test the pattern _ _ _ I A.

Similarly, if we put A in position 2, we test _ A _ I _.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to find words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

First, if A is in position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A.

Possible words: 
- ""PITIA"" -> but that has T, I, A. But we don't know about T and the first three letters. However, note that we have I fixed at position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ I A.

But ""PITIA"" is not a word? Actually, ""PITIA"" is not a valid English word. 

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> but has M, A, N, I, A. But N is eliminated (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E (eliminated) and M, E, D (eliminated).
- ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

How about ""TAXIA""? But that has two A's and X. Also, A at position 2 and 5? But we don't know about X. However, ""TAXIA"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? But typically, we avoid proper nouns. So let's avoid.

Another: ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A. This has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know about M, F. Also, note that we have I at position 4. So pattern: _ A _ I A.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word. However, it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's? But that's okay because we can get feedback on the A's.

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in our guess might be marked as 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

But we are trying to test the position of A. So if we put A in position 2 and 5, then we can get feedback on both.

But we also have to consider that we are testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at position 5 to test the other case? But we might get more information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and then test that pattern? Or position 5?

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct.

For example, let's try to form a word with A in position 5 and I in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless we think there might be two A's? But we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1,2,3: new letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""SPLAT"" -> but that has P, L, A, T. But note: we are putting A at position 5? Actually, ""SPLAT"" has A at position 3? Let's spell: S-P-L-A-T -> A is at position 4? No: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: L
Position 4: A? -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I. So the word must be: _ _ _ I A

So the first three letters are unknown, then I, then A.

Example: ""PANIA"" -> but N is eliminated. 
""MANIA"" -> N eliminated.
""MEDIA"" -> E and D eliminated.

How about ""TAXI""? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

""TAXIA"" -> but that has two A's? And X. Also, it's 5 letters: T-A-X-I-A. But we have I at position 4 and A at position 5. So that fits the pattern. But is it valid? It's a proper noun, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are allowed? Typically, they are not, so we avoid.

Another: ""BASIA"" -> not a word? 
""CHAOS"" -> has C and O (eliminated).

It's hard to find a word with _ _ _ I A.

Try ""SPRIG"" -> but has R (eliminated) and S, P, R, I, G -> R is eliminated.

How about ""SLIMY""? But no A? We must include A.

We need to include A in the word.

So pattern: _ _ _ I A

Possible words: 
- ""FLIA""? Not 5 letters.
- ""BONIA""? Not a word and has O (eliminated).
- ""KAPPA""? Not 5 distinct letters? And has P and A, but also two P's? And no I? We need I at position 4.

Actually, we need the fourth letter to be I and fifth to be A.

So: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.

Examples: 
- ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word? 
- ""PAMIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> has N (eliminated).
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E and D (eliminated).

Another: ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""TAIGA""? Not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe A is in position 2?

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless two A's? but we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 1: new letter
- Position 2: A (if we are testing the A in position 2 case)
- Position 3: new letter
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter? Or A? But if we put A at position 5, then we are testing the A in position 5 case.

But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that has A at position 2 to test that case? Or position 5?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 to see if that is correct.

But let's think of common words that have I in the fourth position.

We know that position 4 is I, so the word ends with ""IA"" or something similar.

But not all words end with IA.

Another idea: ""PLAID"" -> but has D (eliminated) and L, A, I, D -> D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" -> has R (eliminated) and A, I, R -> R eliminated.

""STAID"" -> has D (eliminated) and S, T, A, I, D -> D eliminated.

""SHAIR"" -> has R (eliminated).

It's challenging.

Perhaps we don't have to fix the pattern? We can just include A in the word and see the feedback.

But we must have I at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]I[letter5] and include A in either position 2 or 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if it's wrong, we know A must be in position 2.

Or vice versa.

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be wasteful because we know A is in the word. So we should include A to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include A in the word, either at position 2 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A (meaning A is not at position 5), then we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we put A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

But we can also get a check if we put A at a position we haven't tried? But we haven't tried position 2 or 5 for A.

We tried A only in position 3 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""audio""). So we haven't tried position 2 and 5.

So we can try A in position 2 in this guess? Or position 5?

Let me try to find a word with I in the fourth position and A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Possible words:
- ""BASIS"" -> has S, but also two S's? And no A? Wait, ""BASIS"" has A at position 2? Let's see: B-A-S-I-S -> A at position 2. But then we have S at positions 3 and 5. But we don't know about S. Also, the word has two S's? But that's okay.

But ""BASIS"" has S at positions 3 and 5. And we haven't tested S.

But note: we are avoiding eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> but S is new, so okay.

But is ""BASIS"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have I at position 4 and A at position 2.

So this word tests:
- B at position 1
- A at position 2 (if A is actually at position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know A must be at position 5)
- S at position 3
- S at position 5 (but actually position 5 is A in this pattern? No, in this pattern we are putting A at position 2, so position 5 is S. But we are testing position 2 for A.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLAID"" but D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" has R.

""STAID"" has D.

""SHAIR"" has R.

Another word: ""MASTI"" -> M, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5? We need I at position 4. So ""MASTI"" has I at position 5, not 4.

We need I at position 4.

So let's think of words that have the fourth letter as I.

For example: 
- ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but D is eliminated.
- ""RADII"" -> has R and D (eliminated) and A, D, I, I -> D eliminated.
- ""BACILLUS"" -> too long.

5-letter words with I in the fourth position:

- ""BASIS"" -> as above: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S -> but two S's? And we are testing A at position 2.

But we are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't prohibit it, but we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are also testing A at position 2.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" -> T, A, X, I, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S. This avoids eliminated letters. And A is at position 2.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But we are testing T, X, S.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" -> has N (eliminated) and C (eliminated).

""ALIBI"" -> A at position 1? But we know A is not at position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback: A in position 1 got a minus). So we cannot put A at position 1 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at position 1, so it would be a waste of a position? We would get a minus for A at position 1 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 1, so we shouldn't put A at position 1.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at positions we know it's not: 1 and 3.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we have:
- Position 1: cannot be A (we know A isn't at 1) and cannot be eliminated letter.
- Position 2: can be A? Yes, if we are testing A at position 2.
- Position 3: new letter.
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter (or A if we are testing position 5).

But we don't know if A is at position 2 or 5.

So ""TAXIS"" has A at position 2 and S at 5. We test T, X, S.

But X is not very common.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but then I is not at position 4? We need I at position 4.

""BALMY"" has no I.

We need I at position 4.

So let's search for words that end with ""IA"" or have I as the fourth letter.

Words ending with ""IA"": 
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""MANGA"" -> has N (eliminated) and A at position 3? But we know A isn't at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""MANGA"", A is at position 3? That would be invalid because we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we are putting A at position 2 (which is allowed) and position 5 (which is allowed). But we are not putting A at position 3.

So let's try to find words that have A at position 2 and position 5? No, one word can't have A at both.

So we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 5 and no A at position 2? But then we test only one position.

But we don't have to test both at once.

We can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A, we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we test A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

So we can choose either.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me try to find a word with I at position 4 and A at position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

Examples:
- ""PITIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAXIA"" -> not a word? Actually, ""TAXIA"" is a word? It's a surname, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed. So avoid.
- ""BONIA"" -> has O (eliminated) and not a common word.
- ""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit: we need I at 4 and A at 5? K-A-P-P-A -> positions: 1:K, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:A -> so position 4 is P, not I. So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So: _ _ _ I A

""FLIA"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

""FLIGA""? Not a word.

""SPRIG"" has R.

""SWAGI"" -> not a word.

""SAVIA"" -> not a word.

""SEVIA"" -> not a word and has E.

""SHILY"" -> no A.

It's hard. Maybe ""BASIA"" is not a word.

Another: ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's easier to test the other case: put A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Examples:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But it has two S's. And we are testing A at position 2 and S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice? That might not be efficient.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same as above, but with T and X.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But X is not very common.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A is at position 2, we get a check for A at position 2? And if the word has two A's, we might get a check for the A at position 5? But if the word has only one A, then the A at position 5 might be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the word has A only at position 2, then the A at position 5 would be marked as 'x'? But wait, the feedback: if the secret word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one A would be marked as 'x' if it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so one of the A's might be marked as 'x' if we put it in a position that is not the correct one.

But actually, the feedback is per letter. For the first A (position 2): if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a check. If not, and if the word has A, then the second A (position 5) might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have a second A? But we don't know if the word has one or two A's.

This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at position 2 or 5? But we know A is in the word, so we must have A in either position 2 or 5? Or could A be in position 4? But position 4 is I, so A cannot be at position 4.

So only position 2 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A at position 5.

For example, ""TAXIS"": T, A, X, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""TAXIS"": 
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: X
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""TAXIS"": 
    T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 5.

But X is not a common letter.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

""JAZZY"" -> no I.

""PANIC"" -> has N and C.

How about ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word.

""MANIA"" -> has N.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a check for A at position 2 and a minus for the second A at position 5? Or if the word has two A's, we might get checks for both? But we don't know.

But we are also testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 2 and then if we get a check for A at position 2, then we know A is at 2, and the fifth letter is something else.

But we don't know the fifth letter.

Another word: ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But again, two S's.

We can try ""BASIS"", but we are testing S twice.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> all are new (except A and I) and not eliminated.

But we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

If we get feedback that A at position 2 is correct, then we know A is at 2. And if the word has two S's, we might get feedback for S at 3 and 5.

But we are limited by the words.

Another common word: ""PLAID"" is invalid because of D.

""BLAST"" -> has S, T, but no I? We need I at position 4.

""BLAST"" is B-L-A-S-T -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the pattern _ A _ I _ (with A at position 2) or _ _ A I A (with A at position 5).

Let me try for A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A

Words:
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at position 3? S-T-A-I-R -> A at position 3 -> invalid.
- ""SHAIR"" has R.
- ""SMITH"" -> S, M, I, T, H -> but no A? We must have A in the word. So we cannot use ""SMITH"".

We must include A.

So for A at position 5: 
- ""TAXIA"" -> not common.
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's difficult. So maybe A is more likely at position 2?

So let's try A at position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not eliminated and not A (unless two A's).

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Words:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but position 4 is I? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then we know the word is _ A _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.
- If A at position 2 is not correct (minus), then we know A must be at position 5, and then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.

So we can get information.

But we are also testing the other positions.

Another word: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": 
  P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So back to ""MAFIA"" or ""BASIS"" or ""TAXIS"".

But ""MAFIA"" has two A's and M, F, I, A.

""TAXIS"" has T, A, X, I, S.

""BAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" MAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" PAKER"" -> has E and R.

I think ""TAXIS"" is a valid choice, even though X is uncommon.

But let's see: ""TAXIS"" tests T at position 1, A at position 2, X at position 3, I at position 4 (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for I at 4), and S at position 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and for I (since I is fixed at 4, we get a check). And we test T, X, S.

If A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A must be at 5. And we test T, X, S.

So we can get information.

But we are testing X, which is uncommon.

Alternatively, ""BASIS"" has S at 3 and 5, and B at 1.

But B is common.

Another word: ""PASTA"" -> but has A at position 2 and 5? P, A, S, T, A -> but we have I at position 4? No, ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I[5]

And we want to test A at position 2 or 5.

Let me try for A at position 5: [1][2][3]I A

Examples:
- ""FLIA"" is 4 letters.
- ""BLIA"" -> not a word.
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at 3.
- ""SHIAR"" -> not a word.

""SWIAT"" -> not a word.

""SWIGA"" -> not a word.

""TAWIA"" -> not a word.

""TAIGA"" -> not a word.

""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but U is eliminated (from ""audio"": U was x). So we cannot use U.

""QUAIL"" has U.

""RAILS"" has R and A at 3? R-A-I-L-S -> A at 2? Actually, R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 3. So no.

We need I at position 4.

So for A at position 5: the word must end with ""IA"", like ""PIZZA"" but that's 5 letters? P-I-Z-Z-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 2. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be I.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I A

Examples: 
- ""BONIA"" -> not a word and has O.
- ""CONIA"" -> has O and C.
- ""DONIA"" -> has D and O.

None work.

""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit.

I think it's challenging. So maybe A is more likely at position 2.

So let's go with a word that has A at position 2 and I at position 4.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We have to choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

We can choose common letters.

For example: ""BASIS"" (if we allow repeated S, but we don't know if S is in the word) -> but we are testing S at 3 and 5.

""TAXIS"" (T, A, X, I, S) -> testing T, X, S.

""MAFIA"" (M, A, F, I, A) -> testing M, F, and two A's.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> L(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And we test L, B, and the two A's.

""LABIA"" is a valid word (meaning the lips of a person).

So we have ""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A.

This tests:
- L at position 1
- A at position 2
- B at position 3
- I at position 4 (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for I at 4).
- A at position 5

We test L, B, and the second A.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then the A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check if it's in the correct position? But we don't know.

But we are also testing L and B.

Alternatively, we can try ""BASIS"": B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). We test B, S, and the second S.

But S is tested only once because the second S is at position 5.

We can choose ""BASIS"" to test B and S.

But we are testing S at position 3 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, then we get a check and then we know the word is _ A S I A? But then we have S at position 3. But we don't know if S is in the word.

But we are testing S at 3 and 5.

Another word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is T. So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So let's choose ""BASIS"".

But ""BASIS"" has two S's. If the secret word has only one S, then the second S at position 5 might be marked as 'x'. But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters.

For example, ""BASIS"" has repeated S.

""TAXIS"" has repeated X.

""MAFIA"" has repeated A.

""PALIS"" -> P, A, L, I, S -> but then position 5 is S, but we are not testing A at position 5? In ""PALIS"": P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And no repeated letters.

""PALIS"" is a valid word (meaning to pale or become pale).

This tests:
- P at position 1
- A at position 2
- L at position 3
- I at position 4 (will be a check)
- S at position 5

We test P, L, and S.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and I at 4 is check. Then we know the word is _ A L I S? But we have L at position 3 and S at 5. So if the word is _ A L I S, then we have to find position 1.

But if A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A must be at position 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have P, L, S to test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2. But we test S at 1 and 5.

But again, repeated S.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2 (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A.

And we test P, L, S.

If we get a check for A at 2, then we know A is at 2 and I at 4, and then we have P, L, S to test.

So that's good.

We can also consider ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is M. So no.

""PALIS"" seems good.

Another option: ""SAVOR"" -> but has R and O (eliminated).

I think ""PALIS"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXIS"" is not common.

""MAFIA"" is acceptable: M, A, F, I, A -> but we have I at position 4? In ""MAFIA"": 
  M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check.

But we don't know.

""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

But we are using A twice, which might not be efficient.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, in ""PALIS"", we have A at position 2. If the secret word has A at position 5, then the A at position 2 will be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A, then the A at position 2 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not in the word at that position? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 2 and it's not the correct position, we get a minus. If the secret word has A at position 5, then we get a minus for A at position 2 and then we know A is at 5. And we test P, L, S.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and tests other letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

"" T A X I S "" -> ""TAXIS"" is 5 letters? T-A-X-I-S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S -> so A at 2 and I at 4.

But X is not common.

"" P A L I S "" -> ""PALIS"" is better.

But ""PALIS"" has S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

Another word: ""PANIS"" -> has N.

I think ""PALIS"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" is not a word.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> ""PAMIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" -> ""PALIS"" is the best so far.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SAVOR""? No, because no I at 4.

"" P A L I S "" is the best.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A is at 5. Then we can look for words with A at 5 and I at 4.

But we are also testing L at position 3 and S at 5.

If we get a minus for A at 2, then we know A is at 5, and then we can try to find words with I at 4 and A at 5.

But we have to test position 1 and 3.

So ""PALIS"" seems good.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a valid word and tests P, L, S.

Therefore, I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a 5-letter word meaning pale or become pale.

Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

We are testing S at 3 and 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' if S is not in the word? But we don't know about S.

But we are also testing P and L.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But wait, what if the secret word has A at position 2? Then we get a check for A at 2, and then we know the word is _ A _ I A? Then we have to find position 1 and 3.

But we are testing P at 1, L at 3, and S at 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, we get feedback.
- A at 2: check (if correct) or minus (if not, but then we know A is at 5)
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check (fixed)
- S at 5: test.

If A is not at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, minus or check.
- A at 2: minus (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5.
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check.
- S at 5: test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses distinct letters except for the I and A, which are already known.

But I is known to be at position 4, so we are only testing new letters: P, L, S.

So we can use ""PALIS"".

But is there a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters? 

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I A"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the best.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2.

But we are testing S at 1 and 5.

I think ""PALIS"" is better because it tests P, L, S.

So I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""PASTI"" -> P, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5, not 4. So no.

"" P A S I T "" -> ""PASIT"" not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""PALIS""

<guess>palis</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **First guess ""crane""**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E. Confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Second guess ""audio""**: Eliminated letters U, D, O. Confirmed I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4. Confirmed A is still in the word but not in position 1.

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed at position 4**.
2. **A must be in position 2 or 5** (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test A in position 2**: If A is correct at position 2, we lock in the first part of the word. If A is misplaced, it must be in position 5.
- **Prioritize new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, P) to maximize information.
- **Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A**.

The word **""PALIS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new, tests position 1).
- **A** (tests position 2).
- **L** (new, tests position 3).
- **I** (fixed at position 4, so expected ✓).
- **S** (new, tests position 5).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A and confirm the pattern `_ A _ I _`.
- If A is not at position 2, we get a `-` for A (confirming A is at position 5) and reveal positions 1 and 3.

<guess>palis</guess>",palis,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since it was in position 1 and got ""-""]
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4? Because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter)
- O: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The letter I is in the word and is in the correct position. That position is the fourth letter (because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter and got a check).

2. The letter A is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is now known to be I. So A cannot be in position 4 because that letter is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.

3. We have eliminated the following letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from both guesses: all marked x).

4. We know that the word contains A and I (with I in position 4) and the letters we haven't tested yet.

Now, let's list the knowns:
- Position 4: I
- A is in the word, but not in pos 1,3,4 -> so must be in 2 or 5.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have I in position 4 (because we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Must include A, but in position 2 or 5 (since it can't be in 1,3,4).
- Avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Additionally, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,U,D,I,O. So eliminated: C,R,N,E,U,D,O.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know A is in the word and I is in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ I _

And A must be in position 2 or 5.

We can consider two cases: A in position 2 or A in position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to test both possibilities by including A in one of them and testing other letters for the remaining positions.

However, we must keep in mind that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2).

Let me think of words that have I in the fourth position and A in either position 2 or 5.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> pattern: _ A _ I _
Case 2: A in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ I A

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern, so we might choose a word that has A in position 5 to test that case? Or position 2?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that might be hard.

We can also consider that if we put A in position 5, then we can test the pattern _ _ _ I A.

Similarly, if we put A in position 2, we test _ A _ I _.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to find words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

First, if A is in position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A.

Possible words: 
- ""PITIA"" -> but that has T, I, A. But we don't know about T and the first three letters. However, note that we have I fixed at position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ I A.

But ""PITIA"" is not a word? Actually, ""PITIA"" is not a valid English word. 

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> but has M, A, N, I, A. But N is eliminated (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E (eliminated) and M, E, D (eliminated).
- ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

How about ""TAXIA""? But that has two A's and X. Also, A at position 2 and 5? But we don't know about X. However, ""TAXIA"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? But typically, we avoid proper nouns. So let's avoid.

Another: ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A. This has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know about M, F. Also, note that we have I at position 4. So pattern: _ A _ I A.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word. However, it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's? But that's okay because we can get feedback on the A's.

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in our guess might be marked as 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

But we are trying to test the position of A. So if we put A in position 2 and 5, then we can get feedback on both.

But we also have to consider that we are testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at position 5 to test the other case? But we might get more information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and then test that pattern? Or position 5?

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct.

For example, let's try to form a word with A in position 5 and I in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless we think there might be two A's? But we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1,2,3: new letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""SPLAT"" -> but that has P, L, A, T. But note: we are putting A at position 5? Actually, ""SPLAT"" has A at position 3? Let's spell: S-P-L-A-T -> A is at position 4? No: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: L
Position 4: A? -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I. So the word must be: _ _ _ I A

So the first three letters are unknown, then I, then A.

Example: ""PANIA"" -> but N is eliminated. 
""MANIA"" -> N eliminated.
""MEDIA"" -> E and D eliminated.

How about ""TAXI""? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

""TAXIA"" -> but that has two A's? And X. Also, it's 5 letters: T-A-X-I-A. But we have I at position 4 and A at position 5. So that fits the pattern. But is it valid? It's a proper noun, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are allowed? Typically, they are not, so we avoid.

Another: ""BASIA"" -> not a word? 
""CHAOS"" -> has C and O (eliminated).

It's hard to find a word with _ _ _ I A.

Try ""SPRIG"" -> but has R (eliminated) and S, P, R, I, G -> R is eliminated.

How about ""SLIMY""? But no A? We must include A.

We need to include A in the word.

So pattern: _ _ _ I A

Possible words: 
- ""FLIA""? Not 5 letters.
- ""BONIA""? Not a word and has O (eliminated).
- ""KAPPA""? Not 5 distinct letters? And has P and A, but also two P's? And no I? We need I at position 4.

Actually, we need the fourth letter to be I and fifth to be A.

So: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.

Examples: 
- ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word? 
- ""PAMIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> has N (eliminated).
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E and D (eliminated).

Another: ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""TAIGA""? Not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe A is in position 2?

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless two A's? but we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 1: new letter
- Position 2: A (if we are testing the A in position 2 case)
- Position 3: new letter
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter? Or A? But if we put A at position 5, then we are testing the A in position 5 case.

But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that has A at position 2 to test that case? Or position 5?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 to see if that is correct.

But let's think of common words that have I in the fourth position.

We know that position 4 is I, so the word ends with ""IA"" or something similar.

But not all words end with IA.

Another idea: ""PLAID"" -> but has D (eliminated) and L, A, I, D -> D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" -> has R (eliminated) and A, I, R -> R eliminated.

""STAID"" -> has D (eliminated) and S, T, A, I, D -> D eliminated.

""SHAIR"" -> has R (eliminated).

It's challenging.

Perhaps we don't have to fix the pattern? We can just include A in the word and see the feedback.

But we must have I at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]I[letter5] and include A in either position 2 or 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if it's wrong, we know A must be in position 2.

Or vice versa.

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be wasteful because we know A is in the word. So we should include A to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include A in the word, either at position 2 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A (meaning A is not at position 5), then we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we put A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

But we can also get a check if we put A at a position we haven't tried? But we haven't tried position 2 or 5 for A.

We tried A only in position 3 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""audio""). So we haven't tried position 2 and 5.

So we can try A in position 2 in this guess? Or position 5?

Let me try to find a word with I in the fourth position and A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Possible words:
- ""BASIS"" -> has S, but also two S's? And no A? Wait, ""BASIS"" has A at position 2? Let's see: B-A-S-I-S -> A at position 2. But then we have S at positions 3 and 5. But we don't know about S. Also, the word has two S's? But that's okay.

But ""BASIS"" has S at positions 3 and 5. And we haven't tested S.

But note: we are avoiding eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> but S is new, so okay.

But is ""BASIS"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have I at position 4 and A at position 2.

So this word tests:
- B at position 1
- A at position 2 (if A is actually at position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know A must be at position 5)
- S at position 3
- S at position 5 (but actually position 5 is A in this pattern? No, in this pattern we are putting A at position 2, so position 5 is S. But we are testing position 2 for A.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLAID"" but D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" has R.

""STAID"" has D.

""SHAIR"" has R.

Another word: ""MASTI"" -> M, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5? We need I at position 4. So ""MASTI"" has I at position 5, not 4.

We need I at position 4.

So let's think of words that have the fourth letter as I.

For example: 
- ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but D is eliminated.
- ""RADII"" -> has R and D (eliminated) and A, D, I, I -> D eliminated.
- ""BACILLUS"" -> too long.

5-letter words with I in the fourth position:

- ""BASIS"" -> as above: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S -> but two S's? And we are testing A at position 2.

But we are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't prohibit it, but we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are also testing A at position 2.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" -> T, A, X, I, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S. This avoids eliminated letters. And A is at position 2.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But we are testing T, X, S.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" -> has N (eliminated) and C (eliminated).

""ALIBI"" -> A at position 1? But we know A is not at position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback: A in position 1 got a minus). So we cannot put A at position 1 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at position 1, so it would be a waste of a position? We would get a minus for A at position 1 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 1, so we shouldn't put A at position 1.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at positions we know it's not: 1 and 3.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we have:
- Position 1: cannot be A (we know A isn't at 1) and cannot be eliminated letter.
- Position 2: can be A? Yes, if we are testing A at position 2.
- Position 3: new letter.
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter (or A if we are testing position 5).

But we don't know if A is at position 2 or 5.

So ""TAXIS"" has A at position 2 and S at 5. We test T, X, S.

But X is not very common.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but then I is not at position 4? We need I at position 4.

""BALMY"" has no I.

We need I at position 4.

So let's search for words that end with ""IA"" or have I as the fourth letter.

Words ending with ""IA"": 
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""MANGA"" -> has N (eliminated) and A at position 3? But we know A isn't at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""MANGA"", A is at position 3? That would be invalid because we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we are putting A at position 2 (which is allowed) and position 5 (which is allowed). But we are not putting A at position 3.

So let's try to find words that have A at position 2 and position 5? No, one word can't have A at both.

So we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 5 and no A at position 2? But then we test only one position.

But we don't have to test both at once.

We can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A, we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we test A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

So we can choose either.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me try to find a word with I at position 4 and A at position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

Examples:
- ""PITIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAXIA"" -> not a word? Actually, ""TAXIA"" is a word? It's a surname, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed. So avoid.
- ""BONIA"" -> has O (eliminated) and not a common word.
- ""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit: we need I at 4 and A at 5? K-A-P-P-A -> positions: 1:K, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:A -> so position 4 is P, not I. So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So: _ _ _ I A

""FLIA"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

""FLIGA""? Not a word.

""SPRIG"" has R.

""SWAGI"" -> not a word.

""SAVIA"" -> not a word.

""SEVIA"" -> not a word and has E.

""SHILY"" -> no A.

It's hard. Maybe ""BASIA"" is not a word.

Another: ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's easier to test the other case: put A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Examples:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But it has two S's. And we are testing A at position 2 and S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice? That might not be efficient.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same as above, but with T and X.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But X is not very common.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A is at position 2, we get a check for A at position 2? And if the word has two A's, we might get a check for the A at position 5? But if the word has only one A, then the A at position 5 might be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the word has A only at position 2, then the A at position 5 would be marked as 'x'? But wait, the feedback: if the secret word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one A would be marked as 'x' if it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so one of the A's might be marked as 'x' if we put it in a position that is not the correct one.

But actually, the feedback is per letter. For the first A (position 2): if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a check. If not, and if the word has A, then the second A (position 5) might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have a second A? But we don't know if the word has one or two A's.

This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at position 2 or 5? But we know A is in the word, so we must have A in either position 2 or 5? Or could A be in position 4? But position 4 is I, so A cannot be at position 4.

So only position 2 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A at position 5.

For example, ""TAXIS"": T, A, X, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""TAXIS"": 
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: X
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""TAXIS"": 
    T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 5.

But X is not a common letter.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

""JAZZY"" -> no I.

""PANIC"" -> has N and C.

How about ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word.

""MANIA"" -> has N.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a check for A at position 2 and a minus for the second A at position 5? Or if the word has two A's, we might get checks for both? But we don't know.

But we are also testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 2 and then if we get a check for A at position 2, then we know A is at 2, and the fifth letter is something else.

But we don't know the fifth letter.

Another word: ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But again, two S's.

We can try ""BASIS"", but we are testing S twice.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> all are new (except A and I) and not eliminated.

But we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

If we get feedback that A at position 2 is correct, then we know A is at 2. And if the word has two S's, we might get feedback for S at 3 and 5.

But we are limited by the words.

Another common word: ""PLAID"" is invalid because of D.

""BLAST"" -> has S, T, but no I? We need I at position 4.

""BLAST"" is B-L-A-S-T -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the pattern _ A _ I _ (with A at position 2) or _ _ A I A (with A at position 5).

Let me try for A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A

Words:
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at position 3? S-T-A-I-R -> A at position 3 -> invalid.
- ""SHAIR"" has R.
- ""SMITH"" -> S, M, I, T, H -> but no A? We must have A in the word. So we cannot use ""SMITH"".

We must include A.

So for A at position 5: 
- ""TAXIA"" -> not common.
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's difficult. So maybe A is more likely at position 2?

So let's try A at position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not eliminated and not A (unless two A's).

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Words:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but position 4 is I? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then we know the word is _ A _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.
- If A at position 2 is not correct (minus), then we know A must be at position 5, and then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.

So we can get information.

But we are also testing the other positions.

Another word: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": 
  P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So back to ""MAFIA"" or ""BASIS"" or ""TAXIS"".

But ""MAFIA"" has two A's and M, F, I, A.

""TAXIS"" has T, A, X, I, S.

""BAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" MAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" PAKER"" -> has E and R.

I think ""TAXIS"" is a valid choice, even though X is uncommon.

But let's see: ""TAXIS"" tests T at position 1, A at position 2, X at position 3, I at position 4 (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for I at 4), and S at position 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and for I (since I is fixed at 4, we get a check). And we test T, X, S.

If A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A must be at 5. And we test T, X, S.

So we can get information.

But we are testing X, which is uncommon.

Alternatively, ""BASIS"" has S at 3 and 5, and B at 1.

But B is common.

Another word: ""PASTA"" -> but has A at position 2 and 5? P, A, S, T, A -> but we have I at position 4? No, ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I[5]

And we want to test A at position 2 or 5.

Let me try for A at position 5: [1][2][3]I A

Examples:
- ""FLIA"" is 4 letters.
- ""BLIA"" -> not a word.
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at 3.
- ""SHIAR"" -> not a word.

""SWIAT"" -> not a word.

""SWIGA"" -> not a word.

""TAWIA"" -> not a word.

""TAIGA"" -> not a word.

""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but U is eliminated (from ""audio"": U was x). So we cannot use U.

""QUAIL"" has U.

""RAILS"" has R and A at 3? R-A-I-L-S -> A at 2? Actually, R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 3. So no.

We need I at position 4.

So for A at position 5: the word must end with ""IA"", like ""PIZZA"" but that's 5 letters? P-I-Z-Z-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 2. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be I.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I A

Examples: 
- ""BONIA"" -> not a word and has O.
- ""CONIA"" -> has O and C.
- ""DONIA"" -> has D and O.

None work.

""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit.

I think it's challenging. So maybe A is more likely at position 2.

So let's go with a word that has A at position 2 and I at position 4.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We have to choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

We can choose common letters.

For example: ""BASIS"" (if we allow repeated S, but we don't know if S is in the word) -> but we are testing S at 3 and 5.

""TAXIS"" (T, A, X, I, S) -> testing T, X, S.

""MAFIA"" (M, A, F, I, A) -> testing M, F, and two A's.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> L(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And we test L, B, and the two A's.

""LABIA"" is a valid word (meaning the lips of a person).

So we have ""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A.

This tests:
- L at position 1
- A at position 2
- B at position 3
- I at position 4 (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for I at 4).
- A at position 5

We test L, B, and the second A.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then the A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check if it's in the correct position? But we don't know.

But we are also testing L and B.

Alternatively, we can try ""BASIS"": B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). We test B, S, and the second S.

But S is tested only once because the second S is at position 5.

We can choose ""BASIS"" to test B and S.

But we are testing S at position 3 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, then we get a check and then we know the word is _ A S I A? But then we have S at position 3. But we don't know if S is in the word.

But we are testing S at 3 and 5.

Another word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is T. So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So let's choose ""BASIS"".

But ""BASIS"" has two S's. If the secret word has only one S, then the second S at position 5 might be marked as 'x'. But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters.

For example, ""BASIS"" has repeated S.

""TAXIS"" has repeated X.

""MAFIA"" has repeated A.

""PALIS"" -> P, A, L, I, S -> but then position 5 is S, but we are not testing A at position 5? In ""PALIS"": P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And no repeated letters.

""PALIS"" is a valid word (meaning to pale or become pale).

This tests:
- P at position 1
- A at position 2
- L at position 3
- I at position 4 (will be a check)
- S at position 5

We test P, L, and S.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and I at 4 is check. Then we know the word is _ A L I S? But we have L at position 3 and S at 5. So if the word is _ A L I S, then we have to find position 1.

But if A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A must be at position 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have P, L, S to test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2. But we test S at 1 and 5.

But again, repeated S.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2 (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A.

And we test P, L, S.

If we get a check for A at 2, then we know A is at 2 and I at 4, and then we have P, L, S to test.

So that's good.

We can also consider ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is M. So no.

""PALIS"" seems good.

Another option: ""SAVOR"" -> but has R and O (eliminated).

I think ""PALIS"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXIS"" is not common.

""MAFIA"" is acceptable: M, A, F, I, A -> but we have I at position 4? In ""MAFIA"": 
  M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check.

But we don't know.

""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

But we are using A twice, which might not be efficient.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, in ""PALIS"", we have A at position 2. If the secret word has A at position 5, then the A at position 2 will be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A, then the A at position 2 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not in the word at that position? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 2 and it's not the correct position, we get a minus. If the secret word has A at position 5, then we get a minus for A at position 2 and then we know A is at 5. And we test P, L, S.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and tests other letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

"" T A X I S "" -> ""TAXIS"" is 5 letters? T-A-X-I-S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S -> so A at 2 and I at 4.

But X is not common.

"" P A L I S "" -> ""PALIS"" is better.

But ""PALIS"" has S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

Another word: ""PANIS"" -> has N.

I think ""PALIS"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" is not a word.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> ""PAMIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" -> ""PALIS"" is the best so far.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SAVOR""? No, because no I at 4.

"" P A L I S "" is the best.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A is at 5. Then we can look for words with A at 5 and I at 4.

But we are also testing L at position 3 and S at 5.

If we get a minus for A at 2, then we know A is at 5, and then we can try to find words with I at 4 and A at 5.

But we have to test position 1 and 3.

So ""PALIS"" seems good.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a valid word and tests P, L, S.

Therefore, I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a 5-letter word meaning pale or become pale.

Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

We are testing S at 3 and 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' if S is not in the word? But we don't know about S.

But we are also testing P and L.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But wait, what if the secret word has A at position 2? Then we get a check for A at 2, and then we know the word is _ A _ I A? Then we have to find position 1 and 3.

But we are testing P at 1, L at 3, and S at 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, we get feedback.
- A at 2: check (if correct) or minus (if not, but then we know A is at 5)
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check (fixed)
- S at 5: test.

If A is not at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, minus or check.
- A at 2: minus (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5.
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check.
- S at 5: test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses distinct letters except for the I and A, which are already known.

But I is known to be at position 4, so we are only testing new letters: P, L, S.

So we can use ""PALIS"".

But is there a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters? 

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I A"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the best.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2.

But we are testing S at 1 and 5.

I think ""PALIS"" is better because it tests P, L, S.

So I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""PASTI"" -> P, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5, not 4. So no.

"" P A S I T "" -> ""PASIT"" not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""PALIS""

<guess>palis</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **First guess ""crane""**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E. Confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Second guess ""audio""**: Eliminated letters U, D, O. Confirmed I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4. Confirmed A is still in the word but not in position 1.

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed at position 4**.
2. **A must be in position 2 or 5** (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test A in position 2**: If A is correct at position 2, we lock in the first part of the word. If A is misplaced, it must be in position 5.
- **Prioritize new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, P) to maximize information.
- **Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A**.

The word **""PALIS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new, tests position 1).
- **A** (tests position 2).
- **L** (new, tests position 3).
- **I** (fixed at position 4, so expected ✓).
- **S** (new, tests position 5).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A and confirm the pattern `_ A _ I _`.
- If A is not at position 2, we get a `-` for A (confirming A is at position 5) and reveal positions 1 and 3.",Guess 3: palis -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3 and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, N, E. So we avoid those.

 Common vowels: We know A is in the word. Other vowels could be I, O, U (but note that E is out).
 Common consonants: We can use S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don't say that the word must have distinct letters, but in practice, Wordle words often have distinct letters. However, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters. But for now, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.

 But in our case, we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and we know A is present. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can try to pick a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position (but not third).

 Also, we want to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SALAD"" but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A already known, but we want to test new letters.
 - Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has E which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.

 Possibilities: 
 - A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new) -> but note: we don't know if O, U, B, etc. are in the word.
 - A in the second position: e.g., ""PASTA"" (but has S, T, and two A's) -> but we don't know if the word has two A's? Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let's try to pick a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (so not position 3) and includes other common letters.

 Idea: ""PASTA"" is 5 letters, but it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's. Also, it uses P, A, S, T, A. But we know A is in the word, so we can test P, S, T.

 But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in ""PASTA"" would get an 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters to get clearer feedback.

 Let me try to find a word that has A and 4 other new letters, all distinct and avoiding C, R, N, E.

 Example: ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, and A in the third position? Wait, we cannot put A in the third position because we know that in the first guess (position 3) was A and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But we can try A in a different position.

 How about ""PASTY""? But that has S, T, Y and A. But note: we don't know about S, T, Y. Also, A is in the second position? Let's check: 
 P A S T Y -> A is at position 2.

 But wait, we have to avoid E, which we are. Also, no C, R, N.

 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is not possible because it has E.

 Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but has O and L, but also N (which we know is eliminated) -> so we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try: ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y. A is at position 2. This avoids C, R, N, E.

 But is ""PALSY"" a valid word? Yes, it means a friend or companion.

 Alternatively, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. A at position 2. Avoids C, R, N, E.

 However, we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another common word: ""OASIS"" -> but has two S's and A at position 2. But we don't know about O, S, I.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the number of new letters.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:
 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's and we don't know if two A's exist. Also, A is at position 2 and 4? Actually: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D. But we know A is in the word, so we test S, L, D and the two A's? But the feedback might be confusing.

 Alternatively, ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 Therefore, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with A in position 1: 
   A _ _ _ _ 
 Without C, R, N, E.

 Examples: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. 
 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that's good.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.

 So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.

 ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.

 But note: we don't know if the word has Y, but that's okay.

 However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.

 Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn't have two A's. But we can try.

 But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:
   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don't know. We just know it's not in position 3.

 Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it's correct.

 But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:
   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it's not at 1 either).
   - It introduces B, O, U, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don't know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.

 How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.

 Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So we must include A.

 Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.

 Positions for A: we haven't tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.

 We can try:
   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)
   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)
   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an 'x' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be 'x' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as 'x' because it's not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an 'x' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.

 However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be 'x'. So we can avoid that.

 Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

 So let's avoid position 3.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven't tested any of these letters.

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.

 Which one is better? Both are good.

 Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.

 How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.

 We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an 'x' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.

 Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it's in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn't get information about position 2 until we test.

 Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also tests other common letters.

 I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.

 If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test U, D, I, O.

 So let's go with ""AUDIO"".

 But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".

<guess>audio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.
- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.

The word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).

This guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.

<guess>audio</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Second guess: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since it was in position 1 and got ""-""]
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4? Because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter)
- O: x (not in the word)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The letter I is in the word and is in the correct position. That position is the fourth letter (because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter and got a check).

2. The letter A is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

   However, note that position 4 is now known to be I. So A cannot be in position 4 because that letter is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.

3. We have eliminated the following letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from both guesses: all marked x).

4. We know that the word contains A and I (with I in position 4) and the letters we haven't tested yet.

Now, let's list the knowns:
- Position 4: I
- A is in the word, but not in pos 1,3,4 -> so must be in 2 or 5.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

We need to make a third guess that:
- Must have I in position 4 (because we know it's correct and fixed there).
- Must include A, but in position 2 or 5 (since it can't be in 1,3,4).
- Avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Additionally, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.

What letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,U,D,I,O. So eliminated: C,R,N,E,U,D,O.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know A is in the word and I is in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ I _

And A must be in position 2 or 5.

We can consider two cases: A in position 2 or A in position 5.

But we don't know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.

Alternatively, we can try to test both possibilities by including A in one of them and testing other letters for the remaining positions.

However, we must keep in mind that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2).

Let me think of words that have I in the fourth position and A in either position 2 or 5.

Case 1: A in position 2 -> pattern: _ A _ I _
Case 2: A in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ I A

We can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern, so we might choose a word that has A in position 5 to test that case? Or position 2?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that might be hard.

We can also consider that if we put A in position 5, then we can test the pattern _ _ _ I A.

Similarly, if we put A in position 2, we test _ A _ I _.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me try to find words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.

First, if A is in position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A.

Possible words: 
- ""PITIA"" -> but that has T, I, A. But we don't know about T and the first three letters. However, note that we have I fixed at position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ I A.

But ""PITIA"" is not a word? Actually, ""PITIA"" is not a valid English word. 

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> but has M, A, N, I, A. But N is eliminated (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E (eliminated) and M, E, D (eliminated).
- ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

How about ""TAXIA""? But that has two A's and X. Also, A at position 2 and 5? But we don't know about X. However, ""TAXIA"" is a valid word? Actually, it's a proper noun, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? But typically, we avoid proper nouns. So let's avoid.

Another: ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A. This has A at position 2 and 5. But we don't know about M, F. Also, note that we have I at position 4. So pattern: _ A _ I A.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word. However, it has two A's. We don't know if the secret word has two A's? But that's okay because we can get feedback on the A's.

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in our guess might be marked as 'x'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it's in the word) and the second A might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have two A's.

But we are trying to test the position of A. So if we put A in position 2 and 5, then we can get feedback on both.

But we also have to consider that we are testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A at position 5 to test the other case? But we might get more information.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and then test that pattern? Or position 5?

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct.

For example, let's try to form a word with A in position 5 and I in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

We need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless we think there might be two A's? But we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: A
- Positions 1,2,3: new letters that are not eliminated.

Eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""SPLAT"" -> but that has P, L, A, T. But note: we are putting A at position 5? Actually, ""SPLAT"" has A at position 3? Let's spell: S-P-L-A-T -> A is at position 4? No: 
Position 1: S
Position 2: P
Position 3: L
Position 4: A? -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I. So the word must be: _ _ _ I A

So the first three letters are unknown, then I, then A.

Example: ""PANIA"" -> but N is eliminated. 
""MANIA"" -> N eliminated.
""MEDIA"" -> E and D eliminated.

How about ""TAXI""? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

""TAXIA"" -> but that has two A's? And X. Also, it's 5 letters: T-A-X-I-A. But we have I at position 4 and A at position 5. So that fits the pattern. But is it valid? It's a proper noun, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are allowed? Typically, they are not, so we avoid.

Another: ""BASIA"" -> not a word? 
""CHAOS"" -> has C and O (eliminated).

It's hard to find a word with _ _ _ I A.

Try ""SPRIG"" -> but has R (eliminated) and S, P, R, I, G -> R is eliminated.

How about ""SLIMY""? But no A? We must include A.

We need to include A in the word.

So pattern: _ _ _ I A

Possible words: 
- ""FLIA""? Not 5 letters.
- ""BONIA""? Not a word and has O (eliminated).
- ""KAPPA""? Not 5 distinct letters? And has P and A, but also two P's? And no I? We need I at position 4.

Actually, we need the fourth letter to be I and fifth to be A.

So: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.

Examples: 
- ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word? 
- ""PAMIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""MANIA"" -> has N (eliminated).
- ""MEDIA"" -> has E and D (eliminated).

Another: ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""TAIGA""? Not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe A is in position 2?

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless two A's? but we don't know).

But we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.

But to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.

So let's try to find a word that has:
- Position 1: new letter
- Position 2: A (if we are testing the A in position 2 case)
- Position 3: new letter
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter? Or A? But if we put A at position 5, then we are testing the A in position 5 case.

But we don't know which case, so we can choose a word that has A at position 2 to test that case? Or position 5?

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 to see if that is correct.

But let's think of common words that have I in the fourth position.

We know that position 4 is I, so the word ends with ""IA"" or something similar.

But not all words end with IA.

Another idea: ""PLAID"" -> but has D (eliminated) and L, A, I, D -> D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" -> has R (eliminated) and A, I, R -> R eliminated.

""STAID"" -> has D (eliminated) and S, T, A, I, D -> D eliminated.

""SHAIR"" -> has R (eliminated).

It's challenging.

Perhaps we don't have to fix the pattern? We can just include A in the word and see the feedback.

But we must have I at position 4.

So let's try to find words that have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]I[letter5] and include A in either position 2 or 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if it's wrong, we know A must be in position 2.

Or vice versa.

But we can also choose a word that doesn't have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be wasteful because we know A is in the word. So we should include A to get more information about its position.

So let's try to include A in the word, either at position 2 or at position 5.

But we don't know which, so we can choose one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A (meaning A is not at position 5), then we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we put A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

But we can also get a check if we put A at a position we haven't tried? But we haven't tried position 2 or 5 for A.

We tried A only in position 3 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""audio""). So we haven't tried position 2 and 5.

So we can try A in position 2 in this guess? Or position 5?

Let me try to find a word with I in the fourth position and A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Possible words:
- ""BASIS"" -> has S, but also two S's? And no A? Wait, ""BASIS"" has A at position 2? Let's see: B-A-S-I-S -> A at position 2. But then we have S at positions 3 and 5. But we don't know about S. Also, the word has two S's? But that's okay.

But ""BASIS"" has S at positions 3 and 5. And we haven't tested S.

But note: we are avoiding eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> but S is new, so okay.

But is ""BASIS"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have I at position 4 and A at position 2.

So this word tests:
- B at position 1
- A at position 2 (if A is actually at position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know A must be at position 5)
- S at position 3
- S at position 5 (but actually position 5 is A in this pattern? No, in this pattern we are putting A at position 2, so position 5 is S. But we are testing position 2 for A.

Alternatively, we can try ""PLAID"" but D is eliminated.

""FLAIR"" has R.

""STAID"" has D.

""SHAIR"" has R.

Another word: ""MASTI"" -> M, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5? We need I at position 4. So ""MASTI"" has I at position 5, not 4.

We need I at position 4.

So let's think of words that have the fourth letter as I.

For example: 
- ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but D is eliminated.
- ""RADII"" -> has R and D (eliminated) and A, D, I, I -> D eliminated.
- ""BACILLUS"" -> too long.

5-letter words with I in the fourth position:

- ""BASIS"" -> as above: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S -> but two S's? And we are testing A at position 2.

But we are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't prohibit it, but we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are also testing A at position 2.

Another word: ""TAXIS"" -> T, A, X, I, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S. This avoids eliminated letters. And A is at position 2.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But we are testing T, X, S.

Alternatively, ""PANIC"" -> has N (eliminated) and C (eliminated).

""ALIBI"" -> A at position 1? But we know A is not at position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback: A in position 1 got a minus). So we cannot put A at position 1 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at position 1, so it would be a waste of a position? We would get a minus for A at position 1 again? Actually, we already know it's not at 1, so we shouldn't put A at position 1.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at positions we know it's not: 1 and 3.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we have:
- Position 1: cannot be A (we know A isn't at 1) and cannot be eliminated letter.
- Position 2: can be A? Yes, if we are testing A at position 2.
- Position 3: new letter.
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: new letter (or A if we are testing position 5).

But we don't know if A is at position 2 or 5.

So ""TAXIS"" has A at position 2 and S at 5. We test T, X, S.

But X is not very common.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but then I is not at position 4? We need I at position 4.

""BALMY"" has no I.

We need I at position 4.

So let's search for words that end with ""IA"" or have I as the fourth letter.

Words ending with ""IA"": 
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""MANGA"" -> has N (eliminated) and A at position 3? But we know A isn't at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""MANGA"", A is at position 3? That would be invalid because we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

So for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we are putting A at position 2 (which is allowed) and position 5 (which is allowed). But we are not putting A at position 3.

So let's try to find words that have A at position 2 and position 5? No, one word can't have A at both.

So we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 5 and no A at position 2? But then we test only one position.

But we don't have to test both at once.

We can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A, we know A must be at position 2.

Similarly, if we test A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.

So we can choose either.

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple new letters.

Let me try to find a word with I at position 4 and A at position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ I A

Examples:
- ""PITIA"" -> not a word.
- ""TAXIA"" -> not a word? Actually, ""TAXIA"" is a word? It's a surname, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed. So avoid.
- ""BONIA"" -> has O (eliminated) and not a common word.
- ""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit: we need I at 4 and A at 5? K-A-P-P-A -> positions: 1:K, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:A -> so position 4 is P, not I. So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So: _ _ _ I A

""FLIA"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

""FLIGA""? Not a word.

""SPRIG"" has R.

""SWAGI"" -> not a word.

""SAVIA"" -> not a word.

""SEVIA"" -> not a word and has E.

""SHILY"" -> no A.

It's hard. Maybe ""BASIA"" is not a word.

Another: ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's easier to test the other case: put A in position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

Examples:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But it has two S's. And we are testing A at position 2 and S at positions 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice? That might not be efficient.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same as above, but with T and X.

""TAXIS"" is a valid word.

But X is not very common.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A is at position 2, we get a check for A at position 2? And if the word has two A's, we might get a check for the A at position 5? But if the word has only one A, then the A at position 5 might be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the word has A only at position 2, then the A at position 5 would be marked as 'x'? But wait, the feedback: if the secret word has only one A and we have two A's in the guess, then one A would be marked as 'x' if it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so one of the A's might be marked as 'x' if we put it in a position that is not the correct one.

But actually, the feedback is per letter. For the first A (position 2): if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a check. If not, and if the word has A, then the second A (position 5) might be marked as 'x' if the word doesn't have a second A? But we don't know if the word has one or two A's.

This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have A at position 2 or 5? But we know A is in the word, so we must have A in either position 2 or 5? Or could A be in position 4? But position 4 is I, so A cannot be at position 4.

So only position 2 or 5.

So we can choose a word that has A at position 5.

For example, ""TAXIS"": T, A, X, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""TAXIS"": 
  Position 1: T
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: X
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""TAXIS"": 
    T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 5.

But X is not a common letter.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

""JAZZY"" -> no I.

""PANIC"" -> has N and C.

How about ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word.

""MANIA"" -> has N.

""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a check for A at position 2 and a minus for the second A at position 5? Or if the word has two A's, we might get checks for both? But we don't know.

But we are also testing M and F.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 2 and then if we get a check for A at position 2, then we know A is at 2, and the fifth letter is something else.

But we don't know the fifth letter.

Another word: ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": 
  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But again, two S's.

We can try ""BASIS"", but we are testing S twice.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> all are new (except A and I) and not eliminated.

But we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.

If we get feedback that A at position 2 is correct, then we know A is at 2. And if the word has two S's, we might get feedback for S at 3 and 5.

But we are limited by the words.

Another common word: ""PLAID"" is invalid because of D.

""BLAST"" -> has S, T, but no I? We need I at position 4.

""BLAST"" is B-L-A-S-T -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3.

So we must avoid position 3 for A.

Therefore, for the pattern _ A _ I _ (with A at position 2) or _ _ A I A (with A at position 5).

Let me try for A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A

Words:
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at position 3? S-T-A-I-R -> A at position 3 -> invalid.
- ""SHAIR"" has R.
- ""SMITH"" -> S, M, I, T, H -> but no A? We must have A in the word. So we cannot use ""SMITH"".

We must include A.

So for A at position 5: 
- ""TAXIA"" -> not common.
- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.
- ""PANIA"" -> has N.

I think it's difficult. So maybe A is more likely at position 2?

So let's try A at position 2.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not eliminated and not A (unless two A's).

But we are avoiding eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.

So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

Words:
- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but position 4 is I? In ""BASIS"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: S
  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": 
    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

But we are testing A at position 2 and S at 3 and 5.

But we are testing S twice.

""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then we know the word is _ A _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.
- If A at position 2 is not correct (minus), then we know A must be at position 5, and then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.

So we can get information.

But we are also testing the other positions.

Another word: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": 
  P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We need position 4 to be I.

So back to ""MAFIA"" or ""BASIS"" or ""TAXIS"".

But ""MAFIA"" has two A's and M, F, I, A.

""TAXIS"" has T, A, X, I, S.

""BAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" MAKER"" -> has E and R.

"" PAKER"" -> has E and R.

I think ""TAXIS"" is a valid choice, even though X is uncommon.

But let's see: ""TAXIS"" tests T at position 1, A at position 2, X at position 3, I at position 4 (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for I at 4), and S at position 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and for I (since I is fixed at 4, we get a check). And we test T, X, S.

If A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A must be at 5. And we test T, X, S.

So we can get information.

But we are testing X, which is uncommon.

Alternatively, ""BASIS"" has S at 3 and 5, and B at 1.

But B is common.

Another word: ""PASTA"" -> but has A at position 2 and 5? P, A, S, T, A -> but we have I at position 4? No, ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I[5]

And we want to test A at position 2 or 5.

Let me try for A at position 5: [1][2][3]I A

Examples:
- ""FLIA"" is 4 letters.
- ""BLIA"" -> not a word.
- ""SPRIG"" has R.
- ""STAIR"" has R and A at 3.
- ""SHIAR"" -> not a word.

""SWIAT"" -> not a word.

""SWIGA"" -> not a word.

""TAWIA"" -> not a word.

""TAIGA"" -> not a word.

""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but U is eliminated (from ""audio"": U was x). So we cannot use U.

""QUAIL"" has U.

""RAILS"" has R and A at 3? R-A-I-L-S -> A at 2? Actually, R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 3. So no.

We need I at position 4.

So for A at position 5: the word must end with ""IA"", like ""PIZZA"" but that's 5 letters? P-I-Z-Z-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 2. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be I.

So the word must be: [1][2][3]I A

Examples: 
- ""BONIA"" -> not a word and has O.
- ""CONIA"" -> has O and C.
- ""DONIA"" -> has D and O.

None work.

""KAPPA"" -> doesn't fit.

I think it's challenging. So maybe A is more likely at position 2.

So let's go with a word that has A at position 2 and I at position 4.

Pattern: _ A _ I _

We have to choose letters for positions 1,3,5.

We can choose common letters.

For example: ""BASIS"" (if we allow repeated S, but we don't know if S is in the word) -> but we are testing S at 3 and 5.

""TAXIS"" (T, A, X, I, S) -> testing T, X, S.

""MAFIA"" (M, A, F, I, A) -> testing M, F, and two A's.

But ""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

Another: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.

""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> L(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And we test L, B, and the two A's.

""LABIA"" is a valid word (meaning the lips of a person).

So we have ""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A.

This tests:
- L at position 1
- A at position 2
- B at position 3
- I at position 4 (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for I at 4).
- A at position 5

We test L, B, and the second A.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then the A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check if it's in the correct position? But we don't know.

But we are also testing L and B.

Alternatively, we can try ""BASIS"": B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). We test B, S, and the second S.

But S is tested only once because the second S is at position 5.

We can choose ""BASIS"" to test B and S.

But we are testing S at position 3 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, then we get a check and then we know the word is _ A S I A? But then we have S at position 3. But we don't know if S is in the word.

But we are testing S at 3 and 5.

Another word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is T. So no.

We must have I at position 4.

So let's choose ""BASIS"".

But ""BASIS"" has two S's. If the secret word has only one S, then the second S at position 5 might be marked as 'x'. But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters.

For example, ""BASIS"" has repeated S.

""TAXIS"" has repeated X.

""MAFIA"" has repeated A.

""PALIS"" -> P, A, L, I, S -> but then position 5 is S, but we are not testing A at position 5? In ""PALIS"": P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And no repeated letters.

""PALIS"" is a valid word (meaning to pale or become pale).

This tests:
- P at position 1
- A at position 2
- L at position 3
- I at position 4 (will be a check)
- S at position 5

We test P, L, and S.

If A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and I at 4 is check. Then we know the word is _ A L I S? But we have L at position 3 and S at 5. So if the word is _ A L I S, then we have to find position 1.

But if A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A must be at position 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have P, L, S to test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2. But we test S at 1 and 5.

But again, repeated S.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a valid word? Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2 (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A.

And we test P, L, S.

If we get a check for A at 2, then we know A is at 2 and I at 4, and then we have P, L, S to test.

So that's good.

We can also consider ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is M. So no.

""PALIS"" seems good.

Another option: ""SAVOR"" -> but has R and O (eliminated).

I think ""PALIS"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXIS"" is not common.

""MAFIA"" is acceptable: M, A, F, I, A -> but we have I at position 4? In ""MAFIA"": 
  M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5) -> yes, position 4 is I.

And we test M, F, and the two A's.

But we are testing A at position 2 and 5.

If we get:
- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A's, then the second A at position 5 might be check.

But we don't know.

""MAFIA"" is a valid word.

But we are using A twice, which might not be efficient.

""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, in ""PALIS"", we have A at position 2. If the secret word has A at position 5, then the A at position 2 will be marked as 'x'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A, then the A at position 2 would be marked as 'x' (because it's not in the word at that position? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 2 and it's not the correct position, we get a minus. If the secret word has A at position 5, then we get a minus for A at position 2 and then we know A is at 5. And we test P, L, S.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and tests other letters.

For example, ""PAPAL"" doesn't work.

""TAXI"" is 4 letters.

"" T A X I S "" -> ""TAXIS"" is 5 letters? T-A-X-I-S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S -> so A at 2 and I at 4.

But X is not common.

"" P A L I S "" -> ""PALIS"" is better.

But ""PALIS"" has S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

Another word: ""PANIS"" -> has N.

I think ""PALIS"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" is not a word.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> ""PAMIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" -> ""PALIS"" is the best so far.

So I choose ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SAVOR""? No, because no I at 4.

"" P A L I S "" is the best.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A is at 5. Then we can look for words with A at 5 and I at 4.

But we are also testing L at position 3 and S at 5.

If we get a minus for A at 2, then we know A is at 5, and then we can try to find words with I at 4 and A at 5.

But we have to test position 1 and 3.

So ""PALIS"" seems good.

Another word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.

"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" -> not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a valid word and tests P, L, S.

Therefore, I choose ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a 5-letter word meaning pale or become pale.

Yes.

So guess: ""PALIS""

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don't know.

We are testing S at 3 and 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' if S is not in the word? But we don't know about S.

But we are also testing P and L.

So let's go with ""PALIS"".

But wait, what if the secret word has A at position 2? Then we get a check for A at 2, and then we know the word is _ A _ I A? Then we have to find position 1 and 3.

But we are testing P at 1, L at 3, and S at 5.

If A is at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, we get feedback.
- A at 2: check (if correct) or minus (if not, but then we know A is at 5)
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check (fixed)
- S at 5: test.

If A is not at position 2, then we get:
- P at 1: if in the word, minus or check.
- A at 2: minus (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5.
- L at 3: test.
- I at 4: check.
- S at 5: test.

So we get information.

Moreover, ""PALIS"" uses distinct letters except for the I and A, which are already known.

But I is known to be at position 4, so we are only testing new letters: P, L, S.

So we can use ""PALIS"".

But is there a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters? 

For example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" not a word.

"" P A L I A"" not a word.

"" P A M I A"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the best.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2.

But we are testing S at 1 and 5.

I think ""PALIS"" is better because it tests P, L, S.

So I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at 5 would be wrong? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""PASTI"" -> P, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5, not 4. So no.

"" P A S I T "" -> ""PASIT"" not a word.

So ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""PALIS""

<guess>palis</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **First guess ""crane""**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E. Confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3.
- **Second guess ""audio""**: Eliminated letters U, D, O. Confirmed I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4. Confirmed A is still in the word but not in position 1.

### Key Insights:
1. **I is fixed at position 4**.
2. **A must be in position 2 or 5** (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 4).
3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.
4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- **Test A in position 2**: If A is correct at position 2, we lock in the first part of the word. If A is misplaced, it must be in position 5.
- **Prioritize new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, P) to maximize information.
- **Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A**.

The word **""PALIS""** fits perfectly:
- **P** (new, tests position 1).
- **A** (tests position 2).
- **L** (new, tests position 3).
- **I** (fixed at position 4, so expected ✓).
- **S** (new, tests position 5).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
- If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A and confirm the pattern `_ A _ I _`.
- If A is not at position 2, we get a `-` for A (confirming A is at position 5) and reveal positions 1 and 3.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n\n Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.\n\n We must choose a word that:\n 1.

Other vowels could be I, O, U (but note that E is out).\n Common consonants: We can use S, T, L, P, M, B, D, G, H, K, etc.\n\n We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, the rules don\'t say that the word must have distinct letters, but in practice, Wordle words often have distinct letters. However, we should consider that the secret word might have repeated letters. But for now, to maximize information, we might prefer a word with distinct letters.\n\n But in our case, we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E) and we know A is present.

Also, we have A already known, but we want to test new letters.\n - Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is a common word, but it has E which we know is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E, so let\'s avoid any of the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Possibilities: \n - A in the first position: e.g., ""ABOUT"", ""ABOVE"", ""AFTER"" (but F and T are new) -> but note: we don\'t know if O, U, B, etc. are in the word.\n - A in the second position: e.g., ""PASTA"" (but has S, T, and two A\'s) -> but we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? Also, we have to avoid eliminated letters.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let\'s try to pick a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried (so not position 3) and includes other common letters.\n\n Idea: ""PASTA"" is 5 letters, but it has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s. Also, it uses P, A, S, T, A. But we know A is in the word, so we can test P, S, T.\n\n But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in ""PASTA"" would get an \'x\'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it\'s in the word) and the second A might be marked as \'x\' if the word doesn\'t have two A\'s.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters to get clearer feedback.\n\n Let me try to find a word that has A and 4 other new letters, all distinct and avoiding C, R, N, E.\n\n Example: ""PLAIT"" -> but that has I and T, and A in the third position? Wait, we cannot put A in the third position because we know that in the first guess (position 3) was A and it was wrong position. So in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But we can try A in a different position.\n\n How about ""PASTY""? But that has S, T, Y and A. But note: we don\'t know about S, T, Y. Also, A is in the second position? Let\'s check: \n P A S T Y -> A is at position 2.\n\n But wait, we have to avoid E, which we are. Also, no C, R, N.\n\n Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is not possible because it has E.\n\n Another idea: ""TALON"" -> but has O and L, but also N (which we know is eliminated) -> so we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n Let me try: ""PALSY"" -> P, A, L, S, Y. A is at position 2. This avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n But is ""PALSY"" a valid word? Yes, it means a friend or companion.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. A at position 2. Avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n However, we don\'t know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""OASIS"" -> but has two S\'s and A at position 2. But we don\'t know about O, S, I.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize the number of new letters.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:\n - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A\'s and we don\'t know if two A\'s exist. Also, A is at position 2 and 4? Actually: positions: 1:S, 2:A, 3:L, 4:A, 5:D. But we know A is in the word, so we test S, L, D and the two A\'s? But the feedback might be confusing.\n\n Alternatively, ""STAMP"": S, T, A, M, P. A is at position 3? But we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A (from the first guess). So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n Therefore, we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to form a word with A in position 1: \n   A _ _ _ _ \n Without C, R, N, E.\n\n Examples: ""ADIEU"" -> but has E and we know E is not in the word. \n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. This avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.\n\n ""AUDIO"" is a valid word and uses A, U, D, I, O. We test U, D, I, O and we already know A is present.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""AUDIO"", A is at position 1, which is a new position. So that\'s good.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A, B, O, U, T -> avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n Another: ""AFTER"": A, F, T, E, R -> but E and R are eliminated? We know R is eliminated (from the first feedback: R was x) and E is eliminated. So we cannot use E or R.\n\n So ""AFTER"" is invalid because it has R and E.\n\n How about ""ALOUD"": A, L, O, U, D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And A is at position 1.\n\n ""ALOUD"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""APTLY"": A, P, T, L, Y -> avoids C, R, N, E.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has Y, but that\'s okay.\n\n However, we want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we have eliminated E, N. So we focus on T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\n Let me consider: ""SLANT"" -> but has N (eliminated) and T, L. So we cannot use N.\n\n Another: ""PLAIT"" -> but A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So avoid.\n\n How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s and we are avoiding E, but P, S, T are new. However, we have A at position 2 and 5. We know A is in the word, so the second A might be redundant if the word doesn\'t have two A\'s. But we can try.\n\n But note: we are only on the second guess, so we can try a word that has A in a new position and tests four new letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate because:\n   - It has A at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   - It introduces U, D, I, O (all new letters)\n\n But wait, the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" is also good: A at position 1, and B, O, U, T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word might have A in position 1? We don\'t know. We just know it\'s not in position 3.\n\n Let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. So the A could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We can try to put A in position 1 to see if it\'s correct.\n\n But note: we have 5 more guesses (since we used one). We can try a word that has A in a different position if needed.\n\n However, to maximize information, we might want to test multiple positions for A? But we can only test one position per guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n I think ""ABOUT"" is a good choice because:\n   - It has A at position 1 (if the A is actually at position 1, we get a check, otherwise we get a minus and know it\'s not at 1 either).\n   - It introduces B, O, U, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has B, O, U, T.\n\n Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for the secret word? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3, but we don\'t know about the other positions). However, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not at position 3? Actually, we can put it at position 3 again? But that would be wasteful because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So ""PLAIT"" has A at position 3 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n How about ""PAINT""? But has N (eliminated) and I, T. So no.\n\n Another: ""LIGHT"" -> no A? We must include A because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So we must include A.\n\n Let me try to list words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E, and put A in a new position.\n\n Positions for A: we haven\'t tried position 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\n We can try:\n   A _ _ _ _   (position 1)\n   _ A _ _ _   (position 2)\n   _ _ A _ _   (position 3) -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But if we put A at position 3, we will get an \'x\' for that A? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A and we put A at position 3, then the feedback would be \'x\' for that A? But wait, the feedback is per letter. If the secret word has A only at position 1, then in a word with A at position 3, the A at position 3 would be marked as \'x\' because it\'s not present in the secret word at that position? Actually, no: the feedback marks the letter independently. But note: if the secret word has only one A, then if we put A in a wrong position, we get an \'x\' for that A. But if we put A in a position that is correct, we get a check.\n\n However, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3, we know that the feedback for that A will be \'x\'. So we can avoid that.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good choice because it tests A at position 1 and introduces U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: the word ""AUDIO"" has A at position 1 and then U, D, I, O. We haven\'t tested any of these letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"" has A at position 1 and then B, O, U, T.\n\n Which one is better? Both are good.\n\n Another word: ""AISLE"" -> but has E (eliminated) and S, L. So we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""ALOUD"": A at 1, then L, O, U, D.\n\n We can also consider: ""STAMP"" is invalid because A is at position 3? Actually, we can choose a word that has A at position 3? But we know that in the secret word, position 3 is not A. So if we put A at position 3, we expect an \'x\' for that position. So we can avoid that and test other positions.\n\n Therefore, I will go with ""AUDIO"".\n\n But wait, what if the secret word has A in position 2? Then by putting A in position 1, we might not get information about position 2? Actually, we will: if the A is in the word but not at position 1, then we get a minus for A. And if it were in position 2, then we would get a minus for A in position 1 and then we know it\'s in position 2? Not necessarily, because we wouldn\'t get information about position 2 until we test.\n\n Alternatively, we can test a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also tests other common letters.\n\n I think ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: the first guess had A in position 3 and got a minus. So the A must be in one of the positions: 1,2,4,5.\n\n If we guess ""AUDIO"", we are testing A at position 1. If we get a check for A, then we know A is at position 1. If we get a minus, then we know A is not at position 1 and must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test U, D, I, O.\n\n So let\'s go with ""AUDIO"".\n\n But note: the word ""AUDIO"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""AUDIO"".\n\n<guess>audio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 3.\n- Exclude **C, R, N, E**.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, I, D**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""AUDIO""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **A** in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: **U, D, I, O**.\n- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E).\n\nThis guess will help locate **A** and test four new letters.\n\n<guess>audio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSecond guess: ""audio""\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since it was in position 1 and got ""-""]\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n- I: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4? Because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The letter I is in the word and is in the correct position. That position is the fourth letter (because in ""audio"", I is the fourth letter and got a check).\n\n2. The letter A is in the word, but it is not in position 1 (from ""audio"") and not in position 3 (from ""crane""). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n   However, note that position 4 is now known to be I. So A cannot be in position 4 because that letter is I. Therefore, A must be in position 2 or 5.\n\n3. We have eliminated the following letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from both guesses: all marked x).\n\n4. We know that the word contains A and I (with I in position 4) and the letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nNow, let\'s list the knowns:\n- Position 4: I\n- A is in the word, but not in pos 1,3,4 -> so must be in 2 or 5.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n- Must have I in position 4 (because we know it\'s correct and fixed there).\n- Must include A, but in position 2 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 1,3,4).\n- Avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have used: C,R,A,N,E,U,D,I,O. So eliminated: C,R,N,E,U,D,O.\n\nRemaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know A is in the word and I is in position 4.\n\nSo the secret word pattern is: _ _ _ I _\n\nAnd A must be in position 2 or 5.\n\nWe can consider two cases: A in position 2 or A in position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we might design a guess that can help us determine that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test both possibilities by including A in one of them and testing other letters for the remaining positions.\n\nHowever, we must keep in mind that we have only 4 guesses left (since we used 2).\n\nLet me think of words that have I in the fourth position and A in either position 2 or 5.\n\nCase 1: A in position 2 -> pattern: _ A _ I _\nCase 2: A in position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ I A\n\nWe can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which pattern, so we might choose a word that has A in position 5 to test that case? Or position 2?\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t commit to one case but tests both? But that might be hard.\n\nWe can also consider that if we put A in position 5, then we can test the pattern _ _ _ I A.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A in position 2, we test _ A _ I _.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nLet me try to find words that fit the pattern and avoid eliminated letters.\n\nFirst, if A is in position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""PITIA"" -> but that has T, I, A. But we don\'t know about T and the first three letters. However, note that we have I fixed at position 4, so the word must be _ _ _ I A.\n\nBut ""PITIA"" is not a word? Actually, ""PITIA"" is not a valid English word. \n\nCommon words: \n- ""MANIA"" -> but has M, A, N, I, A. But N is eliminated (from first guess: N was x). So we cannot use N.\n- ""MEDIA"" -> has E (eliminated) and M, E, D (eliminated).\n- ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.\n\nHow about ""TAXIA""? But that has two A\'s and X. Also, A at position 2 and 5? But we don\'t know about X. However, ""TAXIA"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s a proper noun, but in Wordle, it might be accepted? But typically, we avoid proper nouns. So let\'s avoid.\n\nAnother: ""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A. This has A at position 2 and 5. But we don\'t know about M, F. Also, note that we have I at position 4. So pattern: _ A _ I A.\n\nBut ""MAFIA"" is a valid word. However, it has two A\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two A\'s? But that\'s okay because we can get feedback on the A\'s.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has only one A, then the second A in our guess might be marked as \'x\'? Actually, the feedback would mark the first A (if it\'s in the word) and the second A might be marked as \'x\' if the word doesn\'t have two A\'s.\n\nBut we are trying to test the position of A. So if we put A in position 2 and 5, then we can get feedback on both.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing M and F.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have A at position 5 to test the other case? But we might get more information.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has A in position 2 and then test that pattern? Or position 5?\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we can choose a word that has A in position 5 to see if that is correct.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to form a word with A in position 5 and I in position 4.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ I A\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless we think there might be two A\'s? But we don\'t know).\n\nBut we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that has:\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: A\n- Positions 1,2,3: new letters that are not eliminated.\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.\n\nExample: ""SPLAT"" -> but that has P, L, A, T. But note: we are putting A at position 5? Actually, ""SPLAT"" has A at position 3? Let\'s spell: S-P-L-A-T -> A is at position 4? No: \nPosition 1: S\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: L\nPosition 4: A? -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be I. So the word must be: _ _ _ I A\n\nSo the first three letters are unknown, then I, then A.\n\nExample: ""PANIA"" -> but N is eliminated. \n""MANIA"" -> N eliminated.\n""MEDIA"" -> E and D eliminated.\n\nHow about ""TAXI""? That\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""TAXIA"" -> but that has two A\'s? And X. Also, it\'s 5 letters: T-A-X-I-A. But we have I at position 4 and A at position 5. So that fits the pattern. But is it valid? It\'s a proper noun, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are allowed? Typically, they are not, so we avoid.\n\nAnother: ""BASIA"" -> not a word? \n""CHAOS"" -> has C and O (eliminated).\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with _ _ _ I A.\n\nTry ""SPRIG"" -> but has R (eliminated) and S, P, R, I, G -> R is eliminated.\n\nHow about ""SLIMY""? But no A? We must include A.\n\nWe need to include A in the word.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ _ I A\n\nPossible words: \n- ""FLIA""? Not 5 letters.\n- ""BONIA""? Not a word and has O (eliminated).\n- ""KAPPA""? Not 5 distinct letters? And has P and A, but also two P\'s? And no I? We need I at position 4.\n\nActually, we need the fourth letter to be I and fifth to be A.\n\nSo: letter1, letter2, letter3, I, A.\n\nExamples: \n- ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word? \n- ""PAMIA"" -> not a word.\n- ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MANIA"" -> has N (eliminated).\n- ""MEDIA"" -> has E and D (eliminated).\n\nAnother: ""LEGIA"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""TAIGA""? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe A is in position 2?\n\nPattern: _ A _ I _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,3 with letters that are not eliminated and not A (unless two A\'s? but we don\'t know).\n\nBut we are allowed to use A again? Actually, we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So we can use A again to test.\n\nBut to maximize new letters, we might avoid using A again.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word that has:\n- Position 1: new letter\n- Position 2: A (if we are testing the A in position 2 case)\n- Position 3: new letter\n- Position 4: I (fixed)\n- Position 5: new letter? Or A? But if we put A at position 5, then we are testing the A in position 5 case.\n\nBut we don\'t know which case, so we can choose a word that has A at position 2 to test that case? Or position 5?\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 to see if that is correct.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words that have I in the fourth position.\n\nWe know that position 4 is I, so the word ends with ""IA"" or something similar.\n\nBut not all words end with IA.\n\nAnother idea: ""PLAID"" -> but has D (eliminated) and L, A, I, D -> D is eliminated.\n\n""FLAIR"" -> has R (eliminated) and A, I, R -> R eliminated.\n\n""STAID"" -> has D (eliminated) and S, T, A, I, D -> D eliminated.\n\n""SHAIR"" -> has R (eliminated).\n\nIt\'s challenging.\n\nPerhaps we don\'t have to fix the pattern? We can just include A in the word and see the feedback.\n\nBut we must have I at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have the form: [letter1][letter2][letter3]I[letter5] and include A in either position 2 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if it\'s wrong, we know A must be in position 2.\n\nOr vice versa.\n\nBut we can also choose a word that doesn\'t have A at all? But we know A is in the word, so that would be wasteful because we know A is in the word. So we should include A to get more information about its position.\n\nSo let\'s try to include A in the word, either at position 2 or at position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we can choose one arbitrarily.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A (meaning A is not at position 5), then we know A must be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we put A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.\n\nBut we can also get a check if we put A at a position we haven\'t tried? But we haven\'t tried position 2 or 5 for A.\n\nWe tried A only in position 3 (in ""crane"") and position 1 (in ""audio""). So we haven\'t tried position 2 and 5.\n\nSo we can try A in position 2 in this guess? Or position 5?\n\nLet me try to find a word with I in the fourth position and A in position 2.\n\nPattern: _ A _ I _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BASIS"" -> has S, but also two S\'s? And no A? Wait, ""BASIS"" has A at position 2? Let\'s see: B-A-S-I-S -> A at position 2. But then we have S at positions 3 and 5. But we don\'t know about S. Also, the word has two S\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut ""BASIS"" has S at positions 3 and 5. And we haven\'t tested S.\n\nBut note: we are avoiding eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> but S is new, so okay.\n\nBut is ""BASIS"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we have I at position 4 and A at position 2.\n\nSo this word tests:\n- B at position 1\n- A at position 2 (if A is actually at position 2, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and know A must be at position 5)\n- S at position 3\n- S at position 5 (but actually position 5 is A in this pattern? No, in this pattern we are putting A at position 2, so position 5 is S. But we are testing position 2 for A.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""PLAID"" but D is eliminated.\n\n""FLAIR"" has R.\n\n""STAID"" has D.\n\n""SHAIR"" has R.\n\nAnother word: ""MASTI"" -> M, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5? We need I at position 4. So ""MASTI"" has I at position 5, not 4.\n\nWe need I at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that have the fourth letter as I.\n\nFor example: \n- ""VALID"" -> V, A, L, I, D -> but D is eliminated.\n- ""RADII"" -> has R and D (eliminated) and A, D, I, I -> D eliminated.\n- ""BACILLUS"" -> too long.\n\n5-letter words with I in the fourth position:\n\n- ""BASIS"" -> as above: positions: 1:B, 2:A, 3:S, 4:I, 5:S -> but two S\'s? And we are testing A at position 2.\n\nBut we are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don\'t prohibit it, but we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.\n\nBut we are also testing A at position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""TAXIS"" -> T, A, X, I, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S. This avoids eliminated letters. And A is at position 2.\n\n""TAXIS"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are testing T, X, S.\n\nAlternatively, ""PANIC"" -> has N (eliminated) and C (eliminated).\n\n""ALIBI"" -> A at position 1? But we know A is not at position 1 (from ""audio"" feedback: A in position 1 got a minus). So we cannot put A at position 1 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at position 1, so it would be a waste of a position? We would get a minus for A at position 1 again? Actually, we already know it\'s not at 1, so we shouldn\'t put A at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A at positions we know it\'s not: 1 and 3.\n\nSo for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we have:\n- Position 1: cannot be A (we know A isn\'t at 1) and cannot be eliminated letter.\n- Position 2: can be A? Yes, if we are testing A at position 2.\n- Position 3: new letter.\n- Position 4: I (fixed)\n- Position 5: new letter (or A if we are testing position 5).\n\nBut we don\'t know if A is at position 2 or 5.\n\nSo ""TAXIS"" has A at position 2 and S at 5. We test T, X, S.\n\nBut X is not very common.\n\nAnother word: ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but then I is not at position 4? We need I at position 4.\n\n""BALMY"" has no I.\n\nWe need I at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s search for words that end with ""IA"" or have I as the fourth letter.\n\nWords ending with ""IA"": \n- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.\n- ""MANGA"" -> has N (eliminated) and A at position 3? But we know A isn\'t at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in ""MANGA"", A is at position 3? That would be invalid because we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we cannot put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo for the pattern _ _ _ I A, we are putting A at position 2 (which is allowed) and position 5 (which is allowed). But we are not putting A at position 3.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words that have A at position 2 and position 5? No, one word can\'t have A at both.\n\nSo we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 5 and no A at position 2? But then we test only one position.\n\nBut we don\'t have to test both at once.\n\nWe can choose a word that has A at position 5 and then if we get a minus for A, we know A must be at position 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we test A at position 2 and get a minus, then A must be at position 5.\n\nSo we can choose either.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose a word that tests multiple new letters.\n\nLet me try to find a word with I at position 4 and A at position 5.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ I A\n\nExamples:\n- ""PITIA"" -> not a word.\n- ""TAXIA"" -> not a word? Actually, ""TAXIA"" is a word? It\'s a surname, but in Wordle, sometimes proper nouns are not allowed. So avoid.\n- ""BONIA"" -> has O (eliminated) and not a common word.\n- ""KAPPA"" -> doesn\'t fit: we need I at 4 and A at 5? K-A-P-P-A -> positions: 1:K, 2:A, 3:P, 4:P, 5:A -> so position 4 is P, not I. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be I.\n\nSo: _ _ _ I A\n\n""FLIA"" is 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""FLIGA""? Not a word.\n\n""SPRIG"" has R.\n\n""SWAGI"" -> not a word.\n\n""SAVIA"" -> not a word.\n\n""SEVIA"" -> not a word and has E.\n\n""SHILY"" -> no A.\n\nIt\'s hard. Maybe ""BASIA"" is not a word.\n\nAnother: ""TAMIA"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""PANIA"" -> has N.\n\nI think it\'s easier to test the other case: put A in position 2.\n\nPattern: _ A _ I _\n\nExamples:\n- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": \n    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.\n\nBut it has two S\'s. And we are testing A at position 2 and S at positions 3 and 5.\n\nBut we are testing S twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same as above, but with T and X.\n\n""TAXIS"" is a valid word.\n\nBut X is not very common.\n\n""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A\'s.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If A is at position 2, we get a check for A at position 2? And if the word has two A\'s, we might get a check for the A at position 5? But if the word has only one A, then the A at position 5 might be marked as \'x\'? Actually, no: if the word has A only at position 2, then the A at position 5 would be marked as \'x\'? But wait, the feedback: if the secret word has only one A and we have two A\'s in the guess, then one A would be marked as \'x\' if it\'s not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so one of the A\'s might be marked as \'x\' if we put it in a position that is not the correct one.\n\nBut actually, the feedback is per letter. For the first A (position 2): if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a check. If not, and if the word has A, then the second A (position 5) might be marked as \'x\' if the word doesn\'t have a second A? But we don\'t know if the word has one or two A\'s.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have A at position 2 or 5? But we know A is in the word, so we must have A in either position 2 or 5? Or could A be in position 4? But position 4 is I, so A cannot be at position 4.\n\nSo only position 2 or 5.\n\nSo we can choose a word that has A at position 5.\n\nFor example, ""TAXIS"": T, A, X, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""TAXIS"": \n  Position 1: T\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: X\n  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""TAXIS"": \n    T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and S at 5.\n\nBut X is not a common letter.\n\nAnother word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.\n\n""JAZZY"" -> no I.\n\n""PANIC"" -> has N and C.\n\nHow about ""LAMIA"" -> not a common word.\n\n""MANIA"" -> has N.\n\n""MAFIA"" -> M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A\'s.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If the secret word has A at position 2, then we get a check for A at position 2 and a minus for the second A at position 5? Or if the word has two A\'s, we might get checks for both? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are also testing M and F.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A at position 2 and then if we get a check for A at position 2, then we know A is at 2, and the fifth letter is something else.\n\nBut we don\'t know the fifth letter.\n\nAnother word: ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but we have I at position 4? In ""BASIS"": \n  B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.\n\nBut again, two S\'s.\n\nWe can try ""BASIS"", but we are testing S twice.\n\nBut we have to avoid eliminated letters: B, A, S, I, S -> all are new (except A and I) and not eliminated.\n\nBut we are testing S at positions 3 and 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that A at position 2 is correct, then we know A is at 2. And if the word has two S\'s, we might get feedback for S at 3 and 5.\n\nBut we are limited by the words.\n\nAnother common word: ""PLAID"" is invalid because of D.\n\n""BLAST"" -> has S, T, but no I? We need I at position 4.\n\n""BLAST"" is B-L-A-S-T -> A at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\nSo we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern _ A _ I _ (with A at position 2) or _ _ A I A (with A at position 5).\n\nLet me try for A at position 5: pattern _ _ _ I A\n\nWords:\n- ""SPRIG"" has R.\n- ""STAIR"" has R and A at position 3? S-T-A-I-R -> A at position 3 -> invalid.\n- ""SHAIR"" has R.\n- ""SMITH"" -> S, M, I, T, H -> but no A? We must have A in the word. So we cannot use ""SMITH"".\n\nWe must include A.\n\nSo for A at position 5: \n- ""TAXIA"" -> not common.\n- ""BASIA"" -> not a word.\n- ""PANIA"" -> has N.\n\nI think it\'s difficult. So maybe A is more likely at position 2?\n\nSo let\'s try A at position 2.\n\nPattern: _ A _ I _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,3,5 with letters not eliminated and not A (unless two A\'s).\n\nBut we are avoiding eliminated letters: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.\n\nSo available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.\n\nWords:\n- ""BASIS"" -> B, A, S, I, S -> but position 4 is I? In ""BASIS"": \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: S\n  Position 4: I? No, position 4 is I? Actually, ""BASIS"": \n    B (1), A (2), S (3), I (4), S (5) -> yes, position 4 is I.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and S at 3 and 5.\n\nBut we are testing S twice.\n\n""TAXIS"": T (1), A (2), X (3), I (4), S (5) -> same.\n\n""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> M at 1, A at 2, F at 3, I at 4, A at 5. This avoids eliminated letters. And we test M, F, and the two A\'s.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then we know the word is _ A _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.\n- If A at position 2 is not correct (minus), then we know A must be at position 5, and then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have to find position 1 and 3.\n\nSo we can get information.\n\nBut we are also testing the other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": \n  P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be I.\n\nSo back to ""MAFIA"" or ""BASIS"" or ""TAXIS"".\n\nBut ""MAFIA"" has two A\'s and M, F, I, A.\n\n""TAXIS"" has T, A, X, I, S.\n\n""BAKER"" -> has E and R.\n\n"" MAKER"" -> has E and R.\n\n"" PAKER"" -> has E and R.\n\nI think ""TAXIS"" is a valid choice, even though X is uncommon.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""TAXIS"" tests T at position 1, A at position 2, X at position 3, I at position 4 (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for I at 4), and S at position 5.\n\nIf A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and for I (since I is fixed at 4, we get a check). And we test T, X, S.\n\nIf A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A must be at 5. And we test T, X, S.\n\nSo we can get information.\n\nBut we are testing X, which is uncommon.\n\nAlternatively, ""BASIS"" has S at 3 and 5, and B at 1.\n\nBut B is common.\n\nAnother word: ""PASTA"" -> but has A at position 2 and 5? P, A, S, T, A -> but we have I at position 4? No, ""PASTA"": P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.\n\nWe must have I at position 4.\n\nSo the word must be: [1][2][3]I[5]\n\nAnd we want to test A at position 2 or 5.\n\nLet me try for A at position 5: [1][2][3]I A\n\nExamples:\n- ""FLIA"" is 4 letters.\n- ""BLIA"" -> not a word.\n- ""SPRIG"" has R.\n- ""STAIR"" has R and A at 3.\n- ""SHIAR"" -> not a word.\n\n""SWIAT"" -> not a word.\n\n""SWIGA"" -> not a word.\n\n""TAWIA"" -> not a word.\n\n""TAIGA"" -> not a word.\n\n""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L -> but U is eliminated (from ""audio"": U was x). So we cannot use U.\n\n""QUAIL"" has U.\n\n""RAILS"" has R and A at 3? R-A-I-L-S -> A at 2? Actually, R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5) -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 3. So no.\n\nWe need I at position 4.\n\nSo for A at position 5: the word must end with ""IA"", like ""PIZZA"" but that\'s 5 letters? P-I-Z-Z-A -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:Z, 4:Z, 5:A -> but we need I at position 4? Here I is at position 2. So no.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be I.\n\nSo the word must be: [1][2][3]I A\n\nExamples: \n- ""BONIA"" -> not a word and has O.\n- ""CONIA"" -> has O and C.\n- ""DONIA"" -> has D and O.\n\nNone work.\n\n""KAPPA"" -> doesn\'t fit.\n\nI think it\'s challenging. So maybe A is more likely at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s go with a word that has A at position 2 and I at position 4.\n\nPattern: _ A _ I _\n\nWe have to choose letters for positions 1,3,5.\n\nWe can choose common letters.\n\nFor example: ""BASIS"" (if we allow repeated S, but we don\'t know if S is in the word) -> but we are testing S at 3 and 5.\n\n""TAXIS"" (T, A, X, I, S) -> testing T, X, S.\n\n""MAFIA"" (M, A, F, I, A) -> testing M, F, and two A\'s.\n\nBut ""MAFIA"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""PAPAL"" -> P, A, P, A, L -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is A? Actually, ""PAPAL"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need position 4 to be I? So no.\n\n""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> L(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And we test L, B, and the two A\'s.\n\n""LABIA"" is a valid word (meaning the lips of a person).\n\nSo we have ""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A.\n\nThis tests:\n- L at position 1\n- A at position 2\n- B at position 3\n- I at position 4 (we know it\'s correct, so we expect a check for I at 4).\n- A at position 5\n\nWe test L, B, and the second A.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then the A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A\'s, then the second A at position 5 might be check if it\'s in the correct position? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are also testing L and B.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BASIS"": B(1), A(2), S(3), I(4), S(5). We test B, S, and the second S.\n\nBut S is tested only once because the second S is at position 5.\n\nWe can choose ""BASIS"" to test B and S.\n\nBut we are testing S at position 3 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If A at position 2 is correct, then we get a check and then we know the word is _ A S I A? But then we have S at position 3. But we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\nBut we are testing S at 3 and 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PASTY"" -> P, A, S, T, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is T. So no.\n\nWe must have I at position 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BASIS"".\n\nBut ""BASIS"" has two S\'s. If the secret word has only one S, then the second S at position 5 might be marked as \'x\'. But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word without repeated letters.\n\nFor example, ""BASIS"" has repeated S.\n\n""TAXIS"" has repeated X.\n\n""MAFIA"" has repeated A.\n\n""PALIS"" -> P, A, L, I, S -> but then position 5 is S, but we are not testing A at position 5? In ""PALIS"": P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). This avoids eliminated letters. And no repeated letters.\n\n""PALIS"" is a valid word (meaning to pale or become pale).\n\nThis tests:\n- P at position 1\n- A at position 2\n- L at position 3\n- I at position 4 (will be a check)\n- S at position 5\n\nWe test P, L, and S.\n\nIf A is at position 2, then we get a check for A and I at 4 is check. Then we know the word is _ A L I S? But we have L at position 3 and S at 5. So if the word is _ A L I S, then we have to find position 1.\n\nBut if A is not at position 2, then we get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A must be at position 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A, and we have P, L, S to test.\n\nSo we get information.\n\nMoreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2. But we test S at 1 and 5.\n\nBut again, repeated S.\n\n""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.\n\nSo I choose ""PALIS"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nSo guess: ""PALIS""\n\nBut note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2 (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5. Then the word is _ _ _ I A.\n\nAnd we test P, L, S.\n\nIf we get a check for A at 2, then we know A is at 2 and I at 4, and then we have P, L, S to test.\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nWe can also consider ""BALMY"" -> B, A, L, M, Y -> but no I at position 4? Position 4 is M. So no.\n\n""PALIS"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""SAVOR"" -> but has R and O (eliminated).\n\nI think ""PALIS"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.\n\nFor example, ""PAPAL"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""TAXIS"" is not common.\n\n""MAFIA"" is acceptable: M, A, F, I, A -> but we have I at position 4? In ""MAFIA"": \n  M(1), A(2), F(3), I(4), A(5) -> yes, position 4 is I.\n\nAnd we test M, F, and the two A\'s.\n\nBut we are testing A at position 2 and 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If A at position 2 is correct, we get a check and then A at position 5 might be x if the word has only one A? But if the word has two A\'s, then the second A at position 5 might be check.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\n""MAFIA"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we are using A twice, which might not be efficient.\n\n""PALIS"" is better because it has distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S.\n\nSo I choose ""PALIS"".\n\nBut wait, in ""PALIS"", we have A at position 2. If the secret word has A at position 5, then the A at position 2 will be marked as \'x\'? Actually, no: if the secret word has only one A, then the A at position 2 would be marked as \'x\' (because it\'s not in the word at that position? But we know A is in the word, so if we put A at position 2 and it\'s not the correct position, we get a minus. If the secret word has A at position 5, then we get a minus for A at position 2 and then we know A is at 5. And we test P, L, S.\n\nSo we get information.\n\nMoreover, ""PALIS"" uses common letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has A at position 5 and tests other letters.\n\nFor example, ""PAPAL"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""TAXI"" is 4 letters.\n\n"" T A X I S "" -> ""TAXIS"" is 5 letters? T-A-X-I-S -> positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:X, 4:I, 5:S -> so A at 2 and I at 4.\n\nBut X is not common.\n\n"" P A L I S "" -> ""PALIS"" is better.\n\nBut ""PALIS"" has S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be wrong? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""PANIS"" -> has N.\n\nI think ""PALIS"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters.\n\nFor example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" is not a word.\n\n"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.\n\n"" P A M I A"" -> ""PAMIA"" not a word.\n\n"" P A L I S"" -> ""PALIS"" is the best so far.\n\nSo I choose ""PALIS"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SAVOR""? No, because no I at 4.\n\n"" P A L I S "" is the best.\n\nSo guess: ""PALIS""\n\nBut note: we are putting A at position 2. If A is actually at position 5, then we will get a minus for A at position 2, and then we know A is at 5. Then we can look for words with A at 5 and I at 4.\n\nBut we are also testing L at position 3 and S at 5.\n\nIf we get a minus for A at 2, then we know A is at 5, and then we can try to find words with I at 4 and A at 5.\n\nBut we have to test position 1 and 3.\n\nSo ""PALIS"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""BALMY"" -> no I.\n\n"" P A L I A"" -> ""PALIA"" not a word.\n\n"" P A M I A"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""PALIS"" is a valid word and tests P, L, S.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""PALIS"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""PALIS"" is a 5-letter word meaning pale or become pale.\n\nYes.\n\nSo guess: ""PALIS""\n\nBut note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S would be wrong? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe are testing S at 3 and 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at position 5 would be marked as \'x\' if S is not in the word? But we don\'t know about S.\n\nBut we are also testing P and L.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PALIS"".\n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has A at position 2? Then we get a check for A at 2, and then we know the word is _ A _ I A? Then we have to find position 1 and 3.\n\nBut we are testing P at 1, L at 3, and S at 5.\n\nIf A is at position 2, then we get:\n- P at 1: if in the word, we get feedback.\n- A at 2: check (if correct) or minus (if not, but then we know A is at 5)\n- L at 3: test.\n- I at 4: check (fixed)\n- S at 5: test.\n\nIf A is not at position 2, then we get:\n- P at 1: if in the word, minus or check.\n- A at 2: minus (because A is in the word but not at 2) and then we know A is at 5.\n- L at 3: test.\n- I at 4: check.\n- S at 5: test.\n\nSo we get information.\n\nMoreover, ""PALIS"" uses distinct letters except for the I and A, which are already known.\n\nBut I is known to be at position 4, so we are only testing new letters: P, L, S.\n\nSo we can use ""PALIS"".\n\nBut is there a word that has A at position 5 and I at 4 without repeating letters? \n\nFor example, ""P I L I A"" -> ""PILIA"" not a word.\n\n"" P A L I A"" not a word.\n\n"" P A M I A"" not a word.\n\n"" P A L I S"" is the best.\n\nAnother word: ""SALIS"" -> S, A, L, I, S -> repeated S, and A at position 2.\n\nBut we are testing S at 1 and 5.\n\nI think ""PALIS"" is better because it tests P, L, S.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we are testing S at position 5. If the secret word has A at position 5, then S at 5 would be wrong? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider ""PASTI"" -> P, A, S, T, I -> but then I is at position 5, not 4. So no.\n\n"" P A S I T "" -> ""PASIT"" not a word.\n\nSo ""PALIS"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""PALIS""\n\n<guess>palis</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **First guess ""crane""**: Eliminated letters C, R, N, E. Confirmed A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- **Second guess ""audio""**: Eliminated letters U, D, O. Confirmed I is in the word and correctly placed at position 4. Confirmed A is still in the word but not in position 1.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **I is fixed at position 4**.\n2. **A must be in position 2 or 5** (since it can\'t be in 1, 3, or 4).\n3. **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O.\n4. **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- **Test A in position 2**: If A is correct at position 2, we lock in the first part of the word. If A is misplaced, it must be in position 5.\n- **Prioritize new common letters**: Use letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, P) to maximize information.\n- **Avoid eliminated letters and position 3 for A**.\n\nThe word **""PALIS""** fits perfectly:\n- **P** (new, tests position 1).\n- **A** (tests position 2).\n- **L** (new, tests position 3).\n- **I** (fixed at position 4, so expected ✓).\n- **S** (new, tests position 5).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:\n- If A is at position 2, we get a ✓ for A and confirm the pattern `_ A _ I _`.\n- If A is not at position 2, we get a `-` for A (confirming A is at position 5) and reveal positions 1 and 3.\n\n<guess>palis</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: audio -> FEEDBACK: A(-) U(x) D(x) I(✓) O(x)\nGuess 3: palis -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (in the word and in position 4)
- O: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""palis""
- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in position 2)  [this is new! So A is at position 2]
- L: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: ✓ (in position 4, as before)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - A at position 2 (from guess 3: A is ✓ at position 2)
- I at position 4 (from guess 2: I ✓ at position 4)
- S at position 5 (from guess 3: S ✓ at position 5)
- Also, P is in the word but not at position 1 (from guess 3: P - at position 1)
- L is in the word but not at position 3 (from guess 3: L - at position 3)

Moreover, from guess 1, A was not at position 3, but now we know it's at position 2.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from previous feedback).

And from guess 3, we have P and L in the word, but not at the positions we guessed.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ I S

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is in the word but not at position 1) and must be a letter not eliminated.
- Position 3: cannot be L (because L is in the word but not at position 3) and must be a letter not eliminated.

Also, we know the word has A (at position 2), I (at 4), S (at 5), and P and L are in the word, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.

So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] I S

Constraints:
- letter1 cannot be P (because P is in the word but not at position 1) and must be from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- letter3 cannot be L (because L is in the word but not at position 3) and must be from the available letters.

Also, we know that the word contains P and L, which are placed elsewhere.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [1]A[3]I S

And we have to guess it.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3).

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words:

The first letter: can be any available letter except P (because P is not at 1) and not eliminated. So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have L in the word, but not at position 3. So L could be at position 1 or 3? But position 3 cannot be L? Actually, the feedback for L in ""palis"" was at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. So L must be at position 1? Because positions 2,4,5 are taken by A, I, S? Position 2 is A, 4 is I, 5 is S. So the only position left for L is position 1? Or position 3? But position 3 cannot be L? So L must be at position 1.

But wait, the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: I, position 5: S.

So L must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? But we don't know if L can be at position 1.

But from the feedback, L is in the word but not at position 3. And position 2 is A, 4 is I, 5 is S. So yes, L must be at position 1.

Because the secret word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: cannot be L (from guess 3: L - at position 3)
- Position 1: must be filled, and it can be L? Yes, because L is in the word and not at position 3. So L must be at position 1.

Then position 3 is for the remaining letter.

So the word is: L A ? I S

Now, what can be at position 3? It must be a letter not eliminated and not used? We have L, A, I, S. But we can use another letter for position 3.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that starts with L, then A, then some letter, then I, then S.

What words are there? 

For example:
- ""LAMIS"" -> not a word.
- ""LAPIS"" -> L, A, P, I, S -> but P is already in the word? We know P is in the word, but in guess 3 we had P at position 1 and got a minus? Actually, in guess 3, P was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. So P is in the word, but not at position 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3? So that would be: L(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), S(5). But we have P at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if P can be at position 3? Actually, we know P is in the word, but we don't know where. It could be at position 3? But in guess 3, we put P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is not at position 1, but it could be at position 3? However, in the secret word, position 3 is still unknown. But we have no feedback that P is not at position 3? So it could be.

But in ""LAPIS"", we have P at position 3. But we also have L at position 1, which is a new position for L? We don't know if L is at position 1.

But let's check: if the word is ""LAPIS"", then:
- Position 1: L -> but in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, which is fine. And L is at position 1, which is a new position for L? We don't have feedback on L at position 1. In guess 3, L was at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. So position 1 is a possibility.

But we are not sure.

We need to test.

But we also have to avoid eliminated letters: ""LAPIS"" has L, A, P, I, S. L, A, P, I, S are all in the word? We know A, I, S are in the word. L and P are also in the word. And I is fixed.

But in ""LAPIS"", the letter P is at position 3. But we haven't tested P at position 3? We only know P is in the word, not at position 1.

So it's possible.

But we also have to consider: in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, which is consistent.

Similarly, L is at position 1, and we know L is in the word, and it's not at position 3 (from guess 3), so position 1 is possible.

But we don't know for sure.

We can also consider other words.

Another word: ""LAWIS"" -> not a word.

""LAZIS"" -> not a word.

""LAMIS"" -> not a word.

""LAVIS"" -> not a word.

""LAZES"" -> has E and Z, but E is eliminated.

""LAUDS"" -> L, A, U, D, S -> but U and D are eliminated.

So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.

But is ""LAPIS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a type of gemstone.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""LAPSE""? But E is eliminated.

""LARIS"" -> has R (eliminated).

""LAMAS"" -> has A at position 3? L-A-M-A-S -> A at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is I, not A. So no.

""LANIS"" -> has N.

""LAPIS"" seems a strong candidate.

But we have to check if there are other words.

Another: ""LAPIS"" is one.

What about ""LAVAS""? But V and A at position 4? But position 4 must be I, so no.

""LAUDS"" -> eliminated letters.

""LAWS"" -> L, A, W, S -> but then position 4 is W? We need position 4 to be I. So no.

""LAWNS"" -> has N and O.

I think ""LAPIS"" is the only common word that fits: L A P I S.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: L -> we know L is in the word, and it can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 3.
- Position 2: A (we know it's correct)
- Position 3: P -> we know P is in the word, and it can be at position 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 1.
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: S (correct)

And the word ""LAPIS"" avoids eliminated letters.

Moreover, in this word:
- P is at position 3: we haven't tested P at position 3 before? In guess 3, we had P at position 1. Now we are testing P at position 3.

Similarly, L is at position 1, which is a new position for L (previously we had L at position 3, which was wrong).

So we can guess ""LAPIS"".

But note: we are not sure if P can be at position 3? We don't have feedback that P cannot be at position 3. We only know P is not at position 1.

Similarly, L is not at position 3, but it can be at position 1.

So ""LAPIS"" is a valid candidate.

But let's see if there are other words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

For example, ""LAMIS"" is not a word.

""LAVAS"" -> has A at position 4? No, position 4 must be I.

""LAWNS"" -> has N and O.

""LAUDS"" -> has U and D.

""LAZES"" -> has E.

""LAZIS"" -> not a word.

""MAFIS"" -> not a word.

""PALIS"" we already considered, but that has A at position 2 and P at position 3? But in ""PALIS"", we have: P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus? So if the secret word were ""PALIS"", then in guess 3 (""palis""), we had:
- P at 1: should be ✓? But we got P(-) meaning P is not at 1, which is consistent because in ""PALIS"" P is at 3.
- A at 2: should be ✓, but we got A(✓) in ""palis"", which means the A is at position 2? But in ""PALIS"", A is at position 2, so it should be ✓.

But in guess 3, we got A(✓) for position 2, which means the secret word has A at position 2. So ""PALIS"" has A at position 2, which is correct.

Similarly, S at position 5 is correct.

But what about P and L? In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3 and L is at position 2? But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus? That would be inconsistent because in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, not 3.

So ""PALIS"" cannot be the word because in guess 3, when we put L at position 3, we got a minus, meaning L is not at position 3. But in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, so that's fine. But the P at position 1: in ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so when we put P at position 1 in guess 3, it should be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so that's fine. And L is at position 2, not 3, so the minus for L at position 3 in guess 3 is correct because L is at 2.

So ""PALIS"" is consistent with the feedback? Actually, it has L at position 2, not 3, so the minus for L at position 3 in guess 3 is appropriate because L is not at 3.

But in guess 3, we also had S at position 5 and got a check, which is consistent because S is at 5.

But ""PALIS"" is not the word because we got a minus for P at position 1, meaning P is not at 1, which in ""PALIS"" is true because P is at 3.

But we are not guessing ""PALIS"" now.

In our guess, we are trying to solve.

We know the word is _ A _ I S, and we have two letters to determine: position 1 and position 3.

We know the word contains P and L, which must be placed at positions 1 and 3? Because positions 2,4,5 are fixed.

But position 1 and 3 are open.

And we know P and L are in the word, so they must be placed at positions 1 and 3? But we have two positions: 1 and 3, and two letters: P and L? So the word must be either ""LAPIS"" or ""PALIS""? But ""PALIS"" has P at 1 and L at 2? But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is not at position 3. But in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, so that's fine. And P is at position 3? In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so when we guessed P at position 1 in ""palis"", we got a minus because P is at position 3, not 1.

So ""PALIS"" is consistent with the feedback: 
- P is in the word (at position 3 in ""PALIS"") and we put P at position 1 in ""palis"", so it should be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback was P(-) meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so that matches.

Similarly, L is at position 2 in ""PALIS"", and we put L at position 3 in ""palis"", so the minus for L at position 3 is correct because L is at 2.

But is ""PALIS"" the word? No, because we got minuses for P and L, meaning they are not at the positions we guessed.

So the word cannot be ""PALIS"" because we got P(-) and L(-) for positions 1 and 3.

Therefore, the word must be ""LAPIS"".

But let me check if there are other words.

What about ""LAMIS""? Not a word.

""LAVAS""? No, position 4 must be I.

""LAWNS""? No.

""LAUDS""? No.

""LAZES""? No.

""LAZIS""? Not a word.

""MAFIS""? Not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the only common word that fits? But ""PALIS"" is not it.

What about ""PAPIS""? Not a word.

"" P A M I S"" -> ""PAMIS"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the only one.

But ""PALIS"" is not the word because we got P(-) and L(-) for positions 1 and 3.

So the word must be something else.

Another possibility: ""LAPIS"" is one.

But what about ""LAPSE""? E eliminated.

""LARIS"" -> R eliminated.

""LAVAS"" -> not matching pattern.

""LAWNS"" -> not matching.

Perhaps ""LAPIS"" is the only common word.

But let me think: is there a word like ""LAPIS"" but with a different letter at position 3?

For example, ""LAPIS"" has S at position 3 and 5? No, position 3 is P, position 5 is S.

But we are looking for position 3: it must be a letter that is not eliminated and not used? We have L, A, I, S. But we can use another letter for position 3.

But what words? ""LAMIS"" not a word.

""LAVAS"" -> no.

""LAUDS"" -> no.

""LAZES"" -> no.

""LAZIS"" -> no.

""PALIS"" is not it.

Another word: ""LAPIS"" is the only common word I can think of.

But we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of repetition.

Moreover, in the feedback for guess 3, we have P and L as present but wrong position, and they are placed in ""LAPIS"" at positions 1 and 3.

So the secret word must be ""LAPIS"".

Therefore, we should guess ""LAPIS"".

But let me double-check the feedback against ""LAPIS"":

- For guess 1: ""crane"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - C: not in -> x (correct)
  - R: not in -> x (correct)
  - A: in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2, so correct? Actually, in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2, so when we guessed A at position 3 in ""crane"", it was wrong position, so minus. Correct.
  - N: not in -> x (correct)
  - E: not in -> x (correct)

- Guess 2: ""audio"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - A: in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at 2, so not at 1 -> minus. Correct.
  - U: not in -> x (correct)
  - D: not in -> x (correct)
  - I: at position 4 -> in ""LAPIS"", position 4 is I -> check. Correct.
  - O: not in -> x (correct)

- Guess 3: ""palis"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - P: in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, so not at 1 -> minus. Correct.
  - A: at position 2 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2 -> check. Correct.
  - L: in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""LAPIS"", L is at position 1, so not at 3 -> minus. Correct.
  - I: at position 4 -> check. Correct.
  - S: at position 5 -> in ""LAPIS"", S is at position 5 -> check. Correct.

So ""LAPIS"" fits all feedback.

Therefore, we should guess ""LAPIS"".

But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words? But we cannot think of any other common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

So the word is ""LAPIS"".

Thus, we guess ""LAPIS"".

But let me make sure: ""LAPIS"" is a 5-letter word.

So <guess>lapis</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2**: A (confirmed by Guess 3: A(✓))
- **Position 4**: I (confirmed by Guess 2: I(✓))
- **Position 5**: S (confirmed by Guess 3: S(✓))
- **Letter P**: In the word but not in position 1 (Guess 3: P(-))
- **Letter L**: In the word but not in position 3 (Guess 3: L(-))
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from all feedback)

The secret word pattern is: **? A ? I S**

Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be P (since P is present but not in position 1) and must be an unused letter from the available set (B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Position 3: Cannot be L (since L is present but not in position 3) and must be an unused letter from the available set.

Given the pattern, the only common English word that fits all clues is **LAPIS**:
- Position 1: L (possible? L can be at position 1, as it was not ruled out there)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Position 3: P (possible? P is in the word, but not at position 1, and position 3 is untested for P)
- Position 4: I (confirmed)
- Position 5: S (confirmed)

This word uses the available letters, avoids eliminated ones, and satisfies all feedback.

<guess>lapis</guess>",lapis,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""audio""
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)
- I: ✓ (in the word and in position 4)
- O: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""palis""
- P: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- A: ✓ (in the word and in position 2)  [this is new! So A is at position 2]
- L: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- I: ✓ (in position 4, as before)
- S: ✓ (in the word and in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - A at position 2 (from guess 3: A is ✓ at position 2)
- I at position 4 (from guess 2: I ✓ at position 4)
- S at position 5 (from guess 3: S ✓ at position 5)
- Also, P is in the word but not at position 1 (from guess 3: P - at position 1)
- L is in the word but not at position 3 (from guess 3: L - at position 3)

Moreover, from guess 1, A was not at position 3, but now we know it's at position 2.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from previous feedback).

And from guess 3, we have P and L in the word, but not at the positions we guessed.

So the secret word pattern is: _ A _ I S

We know:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is in the word but not at position 1) and must be a letter not eliminated.
- Position 3: cannot be L (because L is in the word but not at position 3) and must be a letter not eliminated.

Also, we know the word has A (at position 2), I (at 4), S (at 5), and P and L are in the word, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.

So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] I S

Constraints:
- letter1 cannot be P (because P is in the word but not at position 1) and must be from the available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- letter3 cannot be L (because L is in the word but not at position 3) and must be from the available letters.

Also, we know that the word contains P and L, which are placed elsewhere.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [1]A[3]I S

And we have to guess it.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we used 3).

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we need to choose a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Let's list possible words:

The first letter: can be any available letter except P (because P is not at 1) and not eliminated. So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we also have L in the word, but not at position 3. So L could be at position 1 or 3? But position 3 cannot be L? Actually, the feedback for L in ""palis"" was at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. So L must be at position 1? Because positions 2,4,5 are taken by A, I, S? Position 2 is A, 4 is I, 5 is S. So the only position left for L is position 1? Or position 3? But position 3 cannot be L? So L must be at position 1.

But wait, the pattern is: position 1: ?, position 2: A, position 3: ?, position 4: I, position 5: S.

So L must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? But we don't know if L can be at position 1.

But from the feedback, L is in the word but not at position 3. And position 2 is A, 4 is I, 5 is S. So yes, L must be at position 1.

Because the secret word has five positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: S
- Position 3: cannot be L (from guess 3: L - at position 3)
- Position 1: must be filled, and it can be L? Yes, because L is in the word and not at position 3. So L must be at position 1.

Then position 3 is for the remaining letter.

So the word is: L A ? I S

Now, what can be at position 3? It must be a letter not eliminated and not used? We have L, A, I, S. But we can use another letter for position 3.

Available letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that starts with L, then A, then some letter, then I, then S.

What words are there? 

For example:
- ""LAMIS"" -> not a word.
- ""LAPIS"" -> L, A, P, I, S -> but P is already in the word? We know P is in the word, but in guess 3 we had P at position 1 and got a minus? Actually, in guess 3, P was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. So P is in the word, but not at position 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3? So that would be: L(1), A(2), P(3), I(4), S(5). But we have P at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if P can be at position 3? Actually, we know P is in the word, but we don't know where. It could be at position 3? But in guess 3, we put P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is not at position 1, but it could be at position 3? However, in the secret word, position 3 is still unknown. But we have no feedback that P is not at position 3? So it could be.

But in ""LAPIS"", we have P at position 3. But we also have L at position 1, which is a new position for L? We don't know if L is at position 1.

But let's check: if the word is ""LAPIS"", then:
- Position 1: L -> but in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, which is fine. And L is at position 1, which is a new position for L? We don't have feedback on L at position 1. In guess 3, L was at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is in the word but not at position 3. So position 1 is a possibility.

But we are not sure.

We need to test.

But we also have to avoid eliminated letters: ""LAPIS"" has L, A, P, I, S. L, A, P, I, S are all in the word? We know A, I, S are in the word. L and P are also in the word. And I is fixed.

But in ""LAPIS"", the letter P is at position 3. But we haven't tested P at position 3? We only know P is in the word, not at position 1.

So it's possible.

But we also have to consider: in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at 1. In ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, which is consistent.

Similarly, L is at position 1, and we know L is in the word, and it's not at position 3 (from guess 3), so position 1 is possible.

But we don't know for sure.

We can also consider other words.

Another word: ""LAWIS"" -> not a word.

""LAZIS"" -> not a word.

""LAMIS"" -> not a word.

""LAVIS"" -> not a word.

""LAZES"" -> has E and Z, but E is eliminated.

""LAUDS"" -> L, A, U, D, S -> but U and D are eliminated.

So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.

But is ""LAPIS"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a type of gemstone.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""LAPSE""? But E is eliminated.

""LARIS"" -> has R (eliminated).

""LAMAS"" -> has A at position 3? L-A-M-A-S -> A at position 2 and 4? But position 4 is I, not A. So no.

""LANIS"" -> has N.

""LAPIS"" seems a strong candidate.

But we have to check if there are other words.

Another: ""LAPIS"" is one.

What about ""LAVAS""? But V and A at position 4? But position 4 must be I, so no.

""LAUDS"" -> eliminated letters.

""LAWS"" -> L, A, W, S -> but then position 4 is W? We need position 4 to be I. So no.

""LAWNS"" -> has N and O.

I think ""LAPIS"" is the only common word that fits: L A P I S.

But let me confirm: 
- Position 1: L -> we know L is in the word, and it can be at position 1? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 3.
- Position 2: A (we know it's correct)
- Position 3: P -> we know P is in the word, and it can be at position 3? Yes, because we only know it's not at position 1.
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: S (correct)

And the word ""LAPIS"" avoids eliminated letters.

Moreover, in this word:
- P is at position 3: we haven't tested P at position 3 before? In guess 3, we had P at position 1. Now we are testing P at position 3.

Similarly, L is at position 1, which is a new position for L (previously we had L at position 3, which was wrong).

So we can guess ""LAPIS"".

But note: we are not sure if P can be at position 3? We don't have feedback that P cannot be at position 3. We only know P is not at position 1.

Similarly, L is not at position 3, but it can be at position 1.

So ""LAPIS"" is a valid candidate.

But let's see if there are other words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

For example, ""LAMIS"" is not a word.

""LAVAS"" -> has A at position 4? No, position 4 must be I.

""LAWNS"" -> has N and O.

""LAUDS"" -> has U and D.

""LAZES"" -> has E.

""LAZIS"" -> not a word.

""MAFIS"" -> not a word.

""PALIS"" we already considered, but that has A at position 2 and P at position 3? But in ""PALIS"", we have: P(1), A(2), L(3), I(4), S(5). But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus? So if the secret word were ""PALIS"", then in guess 3 (""palis""), we had:
- P at 1: should be ✓? But we got P(-) meaning P is not at 1, which is consistent because in ""PALIS"" P is at 3.
- A at 2: should be ✓, but we got A(✓) in ""palis"", which means the A is at position 2? But in ""PALIS"", A is at position 2, so it should be ✓.

But in guess 3, we got A(✓) for position 2, which means the secret word has A at position 2. So ""PALIS"" has A at position 2, which is correct.

Similarly, S at position 5 is correct.

But what about P and L? In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3 and L is at position 2? But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus? That would be inconsistent because in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, not 3.

So ""PALIS"" cannot be the word because in guess 3, when we put L at position 3, we got a minus, meaning L is not at position 3. But in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, so that's fine. But the P at position 1: in ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so when we put P at position 1 in guess 3, it should be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, no: in guess 3, we had P at position 1 and got a minus, meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so that's fine. And L is at position 2, not 3, so the minus for L at position 3 in guess 3 is correct because L is at 2.

So ""PALIS"" is consistent with the feedback? Actually, it has L at position 2, not 3, so the minus for L at position 3 in guess 3 is appropriate because L is not at 3.

But in guess 3, we also had S at position 5 and got a check, which is consistent because S is at 5.

But ""PALIS"" is not the word because we got a minus for P at position 1, meaning P is not at 1, which in ""PALIS"" is true because P is at 3.

But we are not guessing ""PALIS"" now.

In our guess, we are trying to solve.

We know the word is _ A _ I S, and we have two letters to determine: position 1 and position 3.

We know the word contains P and L, which must be placed at positions 1 and 3? Because positions 2,4,5 are fixed.

But position 1 and 3 are open.

And we know P and L are in the word, so they must be placed at positions 1 and 3? But we have two positions: 1 and 3, and two letters: P and L? So the word must be either ""LAPIS"" or ""PALIS""? But ""PALIS"" has P at 1 and L at 2? But in guess 3, we had L at position 3 and got a minus, meaning L is not at position 3. But in ""PALIS"", L is at position 2, so that's fine. And P is at position 3? In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so when we guessed P at position 1 in ""palis"", we got a minus because P is at position 3, not 1.

So ""PALIS"" is consistent with the feedback: 
- P is in the word (at position 3 in ""PALIS"") and we put P at position 1 in ""palis"", so it should be marked as present but wrong position? Actually, the feedback was P(-) meaning P is in the word but not at position 1. In ""PALIS"", P is at position 3, so that matches.

Similarly, L is at position 2 in ""PALIS"", and we put L at position 3 in ""palis"", so the minus for L at position 3 is correct because L is at 2.

But is ""PALIS"" the word? No, because we got minuses for P and L, meaning they are not at the positions we guessed.

So the word cannot be ""PALIS"" because we got P(-) and L(-) for positions 1 and 3.

Therefore, the word must be ""LAPIS"".

But let me check if there are other words.

What about ""LAMIS""? Not a word.

""LAVAS""? No, position 4 must be I.

""LAWNS""? No.

""LAUDS""? No.

""LAZES""? No.

""LAZIS""? Not a word.

""MAFIS""? Not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the only common word that fits? But ""PALIS"" is not it.

What about ""PAPIS""? Not a word.

"" P A M I S"" -> ""PAMIS"" not a word.

"" P A L I S"" is the only one.

But ""PALIS"" is not the word because we got P(-) and L(-) for positions 1 and 3.

So the word must be something else.

Another possibility: ""LAPIS"" is one.

But what about ""LAPSE""? E eliminated.

""LARIS"" -> R eliminated.

""LAVAS"" -> not matching pattern.

""LAWNS"" -> not matching.

Perhaps ""LAPIS"" is the only common word.

But let me think: is there a word like ""LAPIS"" but with a different letter at position 3?

For example, ""LAPIS"" has S at position 3 and 5? No, position 3 is P, position 5 is S.

But we are looking for position 3: it must be a letter that is not eliminated and not used? We have L, A, I, S. But we can use another letter for position 3.

But what words? ""LAMIS"" not a word.

""LAVAS"" -> no.

""LAUDS"" -> no.

""LAZES"" -> no.

""LAZIS"" -> no.

""PALIS"" is not it.

Another word: ""LAPIS"" is the only common word I can think of.

But we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of repetition.

Moreover, in the feedback for guess 3, we have P and L as present but wrong position, and they are placed in ""LAPIS"" at positions 1 and 3.

So the secret word must be ""LAPIS"".

Therefore, we should guess ""LAPIS"".

But let me double-check the feedback against ""LAPIS"":

- For guess 1: ""crane"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - C: not in -> x (correct)
  - R: not in -> x (correct)
  - A: in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2, so correct? Actually, in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2, so when we guessed A at position 3 in ""crane"", it was wrong position, so minus. Correct.
  - N: not in -> x (correct)
  - E: not in -> x (correct)

- Guess 2: ""audio"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - A: in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at 2, so not at 1 -> minus. Correct.
  - U: not in -> x (correct)
  - D: not in -> x (correct)
  - I: at position 4 -> in ""LAPIS"", position 4 is I -> check. Correct.
  - O: not in -> x (correct)

- Guess 3: ""palis"" vs ""LAPIS"":
  - P: in the word but not at position 1 -> in ""LAPIS"", P is at position 3, so not at 1 -> minus. Correct.
  - A: at position 2 -> in ""LAPIS"", A is at position 2 -> check. Correct.
  - L: in the word but not at position 3 -> in ""LAPIS"", L is at position 1, so not at 3 -> minus. Correct.
  - I: at position 4 -> check. Correct.
  - S: at position 5 -> in ""LAPIS"", S is at position 5 -> check. Correct.

So ""LAPIS"" fits all feedback.

Therefore, we should guess ""LAPIS"".

But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words? But we cannot think of any other common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

So the word is ""LAPIS"".

Thus, we guess ""LAPIS"".

But let me make sure: ""LAPIS"" is a 5-letter word.

So <guess>lapis</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 2**: A (confirmed by Guess 3: A(✓))
- **Position 4**: I (confirmed by Guess 2: I(✓))
- **Position 5**: S (confirmed by Guess 3: S(✓))
- **Letter P**: In the word but not in position 1 (Guess 3: P(-))
- **Letter L**: In the word but not in position 3 (Guess 3: L(-))
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, N, E, U, D, O (from all feedback)

The secret word pattern is: **? A ? I S**

Constraints:
- Position 1: Cannot be P (since P is present but not in position 1) and must be an unused letter from the available set (B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Position 3: Cannot be L (since L is present but not in position 3) and must be an unused letter from the available set.

Given the pattern, the only common English word that fits all clues is **LAPIS**:
- Position 1: L (possible? L can be at position 1, as it was not ruled out there)
- Position 2: A (confirmed)
- Position 3: P (possible? P is in the word, but not at position 1, and position 3 is untested for P)
- Position 4: I (confirmed)
- Position 5: S (confirmed)

This word uses the available letters, avoids eliminated ones, and satisfies all feedback.",Guess 4: lapis -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) P(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
