 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should try to use other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. But note that we have only one vowel so far (A and E are absent, but R is present and we know it's in the second position).

We can try a word that has:
- First letter: not C, A, N, E, and preferably a common consonant.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar, avoiding the absent letters.

We also note that we have no information about other positions.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- BRUSH: B R U S H -> but we don't know if B, U, S, H are in the word.
- GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, I, M, Y are new.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> P, O, U, D are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We might also consider that the word must have R in the second position.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Other common words: 
- TRYST: T R Y S T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see if it has any forbidden letter? No, T, R, Y, S are allowed because C,A,N,E are the only ones excluded.
But we have to be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P R O W L -> no forbidden letters.

But we might also consider words that have double letters? But we don't know, so avoid double letters for now.

Alternatively, we can try ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> but O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

We haven't tried O, I, U, and other vowels. We also haven't tried many consonants.

We can also try ""TRYST"" or ""PRISM"".

But note: we have R fixed in the second position.

Let me think of a word that has new letters and common ones.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate:
- P R I S M -> P, I, S, M are all new and common.

But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. ""PRISM"" does not contain any of these.

Similarly, ""BRISK"" is another candidate: B R I S K.

But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> T, I, P, S are new.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get information about P, I, S, M.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden (we know N is absent from the first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C and we know C is absent.

So, let's go with ""PRISM"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has double letters, but we can avoid them for now.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRUTH"": T R U T H -> but it has T twice. It's valid, but we are wasting a letter slot. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, ""PRISM"" is better because it has 4 new distinct letters: P, I, S, M.

We can also consider ""BRUSH"": B R U S H -> but we have U and H.

But I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""PRISM"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will guess ""PRISM"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but we are not using any repeats in this guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PRISM"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- We should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., P, I, S, M, B, T, O, U) to maximize information.
- The word should fit the pattern _ R _ _ _.

A strong candidate is ""prism"":
- P (new letter), R (fixed in position 2), I (new vowel), S (new consonant), M (new consonant).
- This tests four new letters while adhering to the feedback constraints.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), and C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:
   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning wrong position).
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3? Let's check the positions: 
        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)
        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).
   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it's marked with '-', so wrong position).
   - M is absent (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? 
  Wait, from ""prism"":
    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.
    Position 2: R (fixed)
    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)
    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.
    Position 5: M is absent.

Also, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

And the pattern so far: _ R I _ _

We also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.

Possible positions for P: since it can't be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let's see:
The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.

But position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.

So, the secret word must have:
- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn't at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn't at position 4) and not the absent letters.
- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:

The word has:
- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got '-'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.

But position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? 

Also, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So, the possibilities:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.
- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.
- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that's acceptable.

Wait, let me summarize:
- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don't know yet)
- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that's fine)

But we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.

Similarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.

Now, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn't at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.

But note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let's call it X) at the remaining position.

So, positions:
1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).
2: R
3: I
4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)
5: ? (could be S or P or X)

But we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don't know yet.
- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.

We also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test:
- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.
- Position 4: we don't know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know.

But note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don't have to, but we can. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.

But we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don't put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.

So, to get more information, it's better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.

Therefore, our next guess should have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know, could be S, P, or X.

But we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.

So, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.

So, pattern: X R I P S

But is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

What could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Possible words: 
- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.

But let's think: 
- The word would be ? R I P S
- Possibilities: 
  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.

But wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.

Similarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.

Also, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

So, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested T.

But let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.

Now, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it's valid.

But also, we are testing T.

Alternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.

Another word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested B.

But wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.

But is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.

But note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.

But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.

So, ""trips"" fits: 
- Position 1: T (new letter)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)
- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)

Also, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.

But note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don't know. We are testing it.

Similarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.

Another possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we'd have S R I X P? 

Is there a word like ""SRIP""? No. 

Alternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.

So, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? 

Is there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That's 6 letters. 

What about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.

So, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".

But wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.

Alternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.

What if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.

So, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".

But note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.

If the word is ""trips"", then we might get:
- T: if it's correct, then ✓; otherwise, we'll know.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we'd get '-' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get '-' for P (because it's in the word but not at position 4).

Similarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:
- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn't at position 1)
- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn't at position 4)
- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.

And the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Wait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.

Therefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).

So, depending on where P and S are:
- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.

Thus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we haven't tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:
- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.
- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.

So, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback.

But let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? 

What about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.

Common words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.

Another word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.

""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".

But we don't know about G.

Similarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.

So, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.

But note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.

But since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don't know that for sure yet.

Wait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?

Let me re-express:
- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).
- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.

So, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.

Similarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.

But position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: cannot be S.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". 

Therefore, the word must be * R I P S.

So, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn't form a common word? I don't think so. 

What if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Alternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that's impossible.

Or P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that's fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".

So, I will guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don't know.

But ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.

So, next guess: ""TRIPS"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: T (new)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing)
- Position 5: S (we are testing)

If the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:
- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, '-'. But we don't know if T is in the word.

But if we get:
- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.

But if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.

Otherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.

But we might get information.

Alternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.

""GRIPS""? Not common.

So, ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRIPS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **R**.
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.
4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:
   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn't position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn't position 4) and cannot be absent letters.
   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).

### Solving Strategy:
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:
  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: I (fixed).
  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).
  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).
- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.
  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.

<guess>trips</guess>",trips,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:
   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning wrong position).
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3? Let's check the positions:

        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).
   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it's marked with '-', so wrong position).
   - M is absent (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? 
  Wait, from ""prism"":
    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.
    Position 2: R (fixed)
    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)
    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.
    Position 5: M is absent.

Also, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

And the pattern so far: _ R I _ _

We also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.

Possible positions for P: since it can't be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let's see:
The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.

But position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.

So, the secret word must have:
- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn't at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn't at position 4) and not the absent letters.
- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:

The word has:
- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got '-'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.

But position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? 

Also, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So, the possibilities:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.
- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.
- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that's acceptable.

Wait, let me summarize:
- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don't know yet)
- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that's fine)

But we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.

Similarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.

Now, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn't at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.

But note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let's call it X) at the remaining position.

So, positions:
1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).
2: R
3: I
4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)
5: ? (could be S or P or X)

But we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don't know yet.
- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.

We also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test:
- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.
- Position 4: we don't know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know.

But note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don't have to, but we can. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.

But we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don't put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.

So, to get more information, it's better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.

Therefore, our next guess should have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know, could be S, P, or X.

But we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.

So, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.

So, pattern: X R I P S

But is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

What could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Possible words: 
- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.

But let's think: 
- The word would be ? R I P S
- Possibilities: 
  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.

But wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.

Similarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.

Also, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

So, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested T.

But let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.

Now, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it's valid.

But also, we are testing T.

Alternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.

Another word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested B.

But wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.

But is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.

But note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.

But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.

So, ""trips"" fits: 
- Position 1: T (new letter)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)
- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)

Also, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.

But note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don't know. We are testing it.

Similarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.

Another possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we'd have S R I X P? 

Is there a word like ""SRIP""? No. 

Alternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.

So, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? 

Is there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That's 6 letters. 

What about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.

So, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".

But wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.

Alternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.

What if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.

So, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".

But note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.

If the word is ""trips"", then we might get:
- T: if it's correct, then ✓; otherwise, we'll know.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we'd get '-' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get '-' for P (because it's in the word but not at position 4).

Similarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:
- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn't at position 1)
- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn't at position 4)
- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.

And the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Wait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.

Therefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).

So, depending on where P and S are:
- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.

Thus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we haven't tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:
- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.
- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.

So, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback.

But let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? 

What about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.

Common words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.

Another word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.

""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".

But we don't know about G.

Similarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.

So, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.

But note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.

But since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don't know that for sure yet.

Wait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?

Let me re-express:
- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).
- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.

So, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.

Similarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.

But position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: cannot be S.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". 

Therefore, the word must be * R I P S.

So, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn't form a common word? I don't think so. 

What if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Alternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that's impossible.

Or P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that's fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".

So, I will guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don't know.

But ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.

So, next guess: ""TRIPS"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: T (new)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing)
- Position 5: S (we are testing)

If the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:
- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, '-'. But we don't know if T is in the word.

But if we get:
- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.

But if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.

Otherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.

But we might get information.

Alternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.

""GRIPS""? Not common.

So, ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **R**.
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.
4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:
   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn't position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn't position 4) and cannot be absent letters.
   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).

### Solving Strategy:
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:
  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: I (fixed).
  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).
  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).
- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.
  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.",Guess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should try to use other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. But note that we have only one vowel so far (A and E are absent, but R is present and we know it's in the second position).

We can try a word that has:
- First letter: not C, A, N, E, and preferably a common consonant.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar, avoiding the absent letters.

We also note that we have no information about other positions.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- BRUSH: B R U S H -> but we don't know if B, U, S, H are in the word.
- GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, I, M, Y are new.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> P, O, U, D are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We might also consider that the word must have R in the second position.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Other common words: 
- TRYST: T R Y S T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see if it has any forbidden letter? No, T, R, Y, S are allowed because C,A,N,E are the only ones excluded.
But we have to be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P R O W L -> no forbidden letters.

But we might also consider words that have double letters? But we don't know, so avoid double letters for now.

Alternatively, we can try ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> but O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

We haven't tried O, I, U, and other vowels. We also haven't tried many consonants.

We can also try ""TRYST"" or ""PRISM"".

But note: we have R fixed in the second position.

Let me think of a word that has new letters and common ones.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate:
- P R I S M -> P, I, S, M are all new and common.

But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. ""PRISM"" does not contain any of these.

Similarly, ""BRISK"" is another candidate: B R I S K.

But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> T, I, P, S are new.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get information about P, I, S, M.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden (we know N is absent from the first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C and we know C is absent.

So, let's go with ""PRISM"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has double letters, but we can avoid them for now.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRUTH"": T R U T H -> but it has T twice. It's valid, but we are wasting a letter slot. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, ""PRISM"" is better because it has 4 new distinct letters: P, I, S, M.

We can also consider ""BRUSH"": B R U S H -> but we have U and H.

But I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""PRISM"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will guess ""PRISM"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but we are not using any repeats in this guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PRISM"".

<guess>prism</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- We should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., P, I, S, M, B, T, O, U) to maximize information.
- The word should fit the pattern _ R _ _ _.

A strong candidate is ""prism"":
- P (new letter), R (fixed in position 2), I (new vowel), S (new consonant), M (new consonant).
- This tests four new letters while adhering to the feedback constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), and C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:
   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning wrong position).
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3? Let's check the positions: 
        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)
        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).
   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it's marked with '-', so wrong position).
   - M is absent (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? 
  Wait, from ""prism"":
    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.
    Position 2: R (fixed)
    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)
    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.
    Position 5: M is absent.

Also, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

And the pattern so far: _ R I _ _

We also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.

Possible positions for P: since it can't be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let's see:
The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.

But position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.

So, the secret word must have:
- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn't at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn't at position 4) and not the absent letters.
- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:

The word has:
- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got '-'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.

But position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? 

Also, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So, the possibilities:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.
- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.
- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that's acceptable.

Wait, let me summarize:
- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don't know yet)
- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that's fine)

But we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.

Similarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.

Now, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn't at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.

But note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let's call it X) at the remaining position.

So, positions:
1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).
2: R
3: I
4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)
5: ? (could be S or P or X)

But we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don't know yet.
- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.

We also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test:
- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.
- Position 4: we don't know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know.

But note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don't have to, but we can. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.

But we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don't put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.

So, to get more information, it's better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.

Therefore, our next guess should have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know, could be S, P, or X.

But we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.

So, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.

So, pattern: X R I P S

But is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

What could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Possible words: 
- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.

But let's think: 
- The word would be ? R I P S
- Possibilities: 
  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.

But wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.

Similarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.

Also, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

So, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested T.

But let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.

Now, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it's valid.

But also, we are testing T.

Alternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.

Another word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested B.

But wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.

But is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.

But note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.

But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.

So, ""trips"" fits: 
- Position 1: T (new letter)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)
- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)

Also, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.

But note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don't know. We are testing it.

Similarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.

Another possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we'd have S R I X P? 

Is there a word like ""SRIP""? No. 

Alternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.

So, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? 

Is there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That's 6 letters. 

What about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.

So, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".

But wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.

Alternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.

What if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.

So, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".

But note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.

If the word is ""trips"", then we might get:
- T: if it's correct, then ✓; otherwise, we'll know.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we'd get '-' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get '-' for P (because it's in the word but not at position 4).

Similarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:
- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn't at position 1)
- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn't at position 4)
- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.

And the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Wait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.

Therefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).

So, depending on where P and S are:
- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.

Thus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we haven't tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:
- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.
- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.

So, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback.

But let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? 

What about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.

Common words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.

Another word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.

""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".

But we don't know about G.

Similarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.

So, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.

But note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.

But since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don't know that for sure yet.

Wait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?

Let me re-express:
- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).
- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.

So, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.

Similarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.

But position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: cannot be S.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". 

Therefore, the word must be * R I P S.

So, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn't form a common word? I don't think so. 

What if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Alternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that's impossible.

Or P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that's fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".

So, I will guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don't know.

But ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.

So, next guess: ""TRIPS"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: T (new)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing)
- Position 5: S (we are testing)

If the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:
- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, '-'. But we don't know if T is in the word.

But if we get:
- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.

But if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.

Otherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.

But we might get information.

Alternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.

""GRIPS""? Not common.

So, ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **R**.
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.
4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:
   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn't position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn't position 4) and cannot be absent letters.
   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).

### Solving Strategy:
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:
  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: I (fixed).
  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).
  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).
- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.
  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.

We don\'t know, but we are not using any repeats in this guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""PRISM"".\n\n<guess>prism</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").\n\nThis means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E.\n- We should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., P, I, S, M, B, T, O, U) to maximize information.\n- The word should fit the pattern _ R _ _ _.\n\nA strong candidate is ""prism"":\n- P (new letter), R (fixed in position 2), I (new vowel), S (new consonant), M (new consonant).\n- This tests four new letters while adhering to the feedback constraints.\n\n<guess>prism</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), and C, A, N, E are absent.\n2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:\n   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it\'s marked with \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).\n   - I is correct and in position 3? Let\'s check the positions: \n        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)\n        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).\n   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it\'s marked with \'-\', so wrong position).\n   - M is absent (x).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? \n  Wait, from ""prism"":\n    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.\n    Position 2: R (fixed)\n    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)\n    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.\n    Position 5: M is absent.\n\nAlso, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nAnd the pattern so far: _ R I _ _\n\nWe also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for P: since it can\'t be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let\'s see:\nThe word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n- Position 2: R (fixed)\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.\n\nTherefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.\n\nSo, the secret word must have:\n- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn\'t at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn\'t at position 4) and not the absent letters.\n- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:\n\nThe word has:\n- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got \'-\'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? \n\nAlso, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.\n\nSo, the possibilities:\n- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.\n- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that\'s acceptable.\n\nWait, let me summarize:\n- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don\'t know yet)\n- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that\'s fine)\n\nBut we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.\n\nNow, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn\'t at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.\n\nBut note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let\'s call it X) at the remaining position.\n\nSo, positions:\n1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).\n2: R\n3: I\n4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)\n5: ? (could be S or P or X)\n\nBut we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.\n\nNow, let\'s consider the constraints:\n- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don\'t know yet.\n- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nWe also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test:\n- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.\n- Position 4: we don\'t know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know.\n\nBut note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don\'t have to, but we can. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.\n\nBut we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don\'t put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn\'t have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.\n\nSo, to get more information, it\'s better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know, could be S, P, or X.\n\nBut we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.\n\nSo, pattern: X R I P S\n\nBut is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nWhat could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.\n\nPossible words: \n- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.\n\nBut let\'s think: \n- The word would be ? R I P S\n- Possibilities: \n  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.\n\nAlso, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nSo, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested T.\n\nBut let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.\n\nNow, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it\'s valid.\n\nBut also, we are testing T.\n\nAlternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.\n\nAnother word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested B.\n\nBut wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.\n\nBut is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.\n\nBut we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.\n\nSo, ""trips"" fits: \n- Position 1: T (new letter)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)\n\nAlso, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don\'t know. We are testing it.\n\nSimilarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.\n\nAnother possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we\'d have S R I X P? \n\nIs there a word like ""SRIP""? No. \n\nAlternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.\n\nSo, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don\'t have evidence for that yet.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? \n\nIs there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That\'s 6 letters. \n\nWhat about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.\n\nSo, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.\n\nAlternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.\n\nWhat if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.\n\nIf the word is ""trips"", then we might get:\n- T: if it\'s correct, then ✓; otherwise, we\'ll know.\n- R: ✓ (position 2)\n- I: ✓ (position 3)\n- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we\'d get \'-\' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get \'-\' for P (because it\'s in the word but not at position 4).\n\nSimilarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:\n- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn\'t at position 1)\n- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn\'t at position 4)\n- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.\n\nAnd the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.\n\nTherefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).\n\nSo, depending on where P and S are:\n- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that\'s impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.\n\nThus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:\n- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.\n- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? \n\nWhat about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.\n\nCommon words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.\n\n""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".\n\nBut we don\'t know about G.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.\n\nBut note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.\n\nBut since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don\'t know that for sure yet.\n\nWait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?\n\nLet me re-express:\n- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).\n- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.\n\nSo, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: cannot be S.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". \n\nTherefore, the word must be * R I P S.\n\nSo, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn\'t form a common word? I don\'t think so. \n\nWhat if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nAlternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that\'s impossible.\n\nOr P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that\'s fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.\n\nTherefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".\n\nSo, I will guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, next guess: ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n- Position 1: T (new)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing)\n\nIf the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:\n- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, \'-\'. But we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nBut if we get:\n- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.\n\nOtherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.\n\nBut we might get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.\n\n""GRIPS""? Not common.\n\nSo, ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.\n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**: \n   - Position 2 must be **R**.\n   - Position 3 must be **I**.\n2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:\n   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.\n4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:\n   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn\'t position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn\'t position 4) and cannot be absent letters.\n   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).\n\n### Solving Strategy:\n- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:\n  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).\n  - Position 2: R (fixed).\n  - Position 3: I (fixed).\n  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).\n  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).\n- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:\n  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.\n  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)\nGuess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:
  Position 1: T (absent)
  Position 2: R (correct)
  Position 3: I (correct)
  Position 4: P (correct)
  Position 5: S (correct)

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: S

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).

But we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.

So, what letters can be at position 1?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).

Let's list the possible letters: 
- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.

But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That's not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. 

So, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.

Now, what words end with ""RIPS""? 
- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.
- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven't tested B.
- GRIPS: G not excluded.
- DRIPS: D not excluded.
- FRIPS: F not excluded.
- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that's not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.

Actually, common words:
- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.
- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.
- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.
- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.
- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let's stick to common words.

Also, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.

""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.

So, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. 

Alternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. 

Therefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.

So, B, G, D, F are all allowed.

Now, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.

But we need to test the first letter.

Alternatively, we can guess one of these to see.

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.

But let me see: if we guess ""BRIPS"", then:
- If the secret word is ""BRIPS"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback that B is absent? Then we try another.

But we have multiple options. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one unknown letter (position 1) and we know the rest.

But we don't know which of the BRIPS, GRIPS, etc. it is.

So, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far? And the pattern doesn't force duplicates.

But let's check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had P and S present, and in ""trips"" we had P and S correct at positions 4 and 5? And the first letter was T which was absent. So if the secret word were ""BRIPS"", then B is present? But we haven't tested B.

Similarly, we can try ""GRIPS"".

But we can also try to use a word that doesn't fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

So, let's list the possibilities we have: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But ""WRIPS"" might be considered a variant of ""wrip"", but I think it's not standard? Actually, ""wrip"" is the base, but ""wips"" is not a word? So we can exclude it.

Therefore, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have four possibilities. We can try one.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we need to choose one. We can start with the most common one? Or try to test.

But note: we don't have any information about B, G, D, F? So we can pick one arbitrarily.

But we can also consider that in the first guess, we had no information about other letters? Actually, we have been testing letters: crane had C,R,A,N,E; prism had P,R,I,S,M; trips had T,R,I,P,S? But note, in ""trips"", we had T at position 1 (absent) and the rest correct.

So, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don't have any other constraints.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can't use T.

So, let's choose ""BRIPS"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven't tested B? So we can test.

But we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then '-'.
- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.

But if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we'd get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it's not B, and we try G.

Similarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don't have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.

But note: we don't have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it's ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don't know.

Wait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:
- B: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.
- S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.

Similarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- G: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

But if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- D: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

So, we can test one and then proceed.

But we have three possibilities left? Actually, there might be more? What about ""FRIPS""? Or ""WRIPS""? 

Let me list all the common words ending with ""RIPS"" that do not contain T, C, A, N, E, M:
- BRIPS
- GRIPS
- DRIPS
- FRIPS
- PRIPS? Not a word.
- TRIPS? We tried.
- SRIPS? Not a word.

Also, ""THRIPS""? Not a word.

So, four candidates: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We can try ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""BRIPS"".

But we can also note that in the first guess, we had no information about B, G, D, F? So we can test one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and uses a letter that is common to multiple, but we don't have such a word? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me see: we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also consider: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""GRIPS"" and we guess ""BRIPS"", then B is absent? But then we know it's not B, and we try G.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple? Because we don't know the first letter.

So, we have to choose one.

I think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.

So, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.

But I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.

So, I'll guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me double-check: 
- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.
- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.

So, we have to test one.

Therefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".

<guess>brips</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C, A, N, E absent (x)  
  - R correct at position 2 (✓)  
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  
  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  
  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)  
  - S present but not at position 4 (-)  
  - M absent (x)  
- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:  
  - T absent (x)  
  - R, I, P, S correct at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (✓)  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed: R, I, P, S).  
2. Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter **not excluded** and **not** P (since P isn't at position 1).  
3. Absent letters: **C, A, N, E, M, T** (from feedback).  
4. Present letters: **P** (position 4) and **S** (position 5), both confirmed in the last guess.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word ends with ""RIPS"".  
- Position 1 must be a letter not in {C, A, N, E, M, T} and not I/S (since I/S are already placed).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **BRIPS**, **GRIPS**, **DRIPS**, **FRIPS**.  

### Strategy:
- With only one unknown letter (position 1) and four possible candidates, we can test **BRIPS** to check if B is the first letter.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm B is absent, narrowing the options to GRIPS, DRIPS, or FRIPS for the next guess.  

<guess>brips</guess>",brips,"We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:
  Position 1: T (absent)
  Position 2: R (correct)
  Position 3: I (correct)
  Position 4: P (correct)
  Position 5: S (correct)

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: S

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).

But we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.

So, what letters can be at position 1?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).

Let's list the possible letters: 
- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.

But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That's not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. 

So, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.

Now, what words end with ""RIPS""? 
- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.
- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven't tested B.
- GRIPS: G not excluded.
- DRIPS: D not excluded.
- FRIPS: F not excluded.
- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that's not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.

Actually, common words:
- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.
- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.
- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.
- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.
- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let's stick to common words.

Also, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.

""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.

So, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. 

Alternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. 

Therefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.

So, B, G, D, F are all allowed.

Now, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.

But we need to test the first letter.

Alternatively, we can guess one of these to see.

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.

But we can also try to use a word that doesn't fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

So, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don't have any other constraints.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can't use T.

So, let's choose ""BRIPS"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven't tested B? So we can test.

But we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then '-'.
- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.

But if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we'd get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it's not B, and we try G.

Similarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don't have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.

But note: we don't have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it's ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don't know.

Wait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:
- B: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.
- S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.

Similarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- G: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

But if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- D: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

So, we can test one and then proceed.

I think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.

So, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.

But I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.

So, I'll guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me double-check: 
- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.
- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.

So, we have to test one.

Therefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".

<guess>brips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:

- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  
  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  
  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)

- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:

2. Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter **not excluded** and **not** P (since P isn't at position 1).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should try to use other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. But note that we have only one vowel so far (A and E are absent, but R is present and we know it's in the second position).

We can try a word that has:
- First letter: not C, A, N, E, and preferably a common consonant.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar, avoiding the absent letters.

We also note that we have no information about other positions.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- BRUSH: B R U S H -> but we don't know if B, U, S, H are in the word.
- GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, I, M, Y are new.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> P, O, U, D are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We might also consider that the word must have R in the second position.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Other common words: 
- TRYST: T R Y S T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see if it has any forbidden letter? No, T, R, Y, S are allowed because C,A,N,E are the only ones excluded.
But we have to be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P R O W L -> no forbidden letters.

But we might also consider words that have double letters? But we don't know, so avoid double letters for now.

Alternatively, we can try ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> but O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

We haven't tried O, I, U, and other vowels. We also haven't tried many consonants.

We can also try ""TRYST"" or ""PRISM"".

But note: we have R fixed in the second position.

Let me think of a word that has new letters and common ones.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate:
- P R I S M -> P, I, S, M are all new and common.

But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. ""PRISM"" does not contain any of these.

Similarly, ""BRISK"" is another candidate: B R I S K.

But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> T, I, P, S are new.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get information about P, I, S, M.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden (we know N is absent from the first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C and we know C is absent.

So, let's go with ""PRISM"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has double letters, but we can avoid them for now.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRUTH"": T R U T H -> but it has T twice. It's valid, but we are wasting a letter slot. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, ""PRISM"" is better because it has 4 new distinct letters: P, I, S, M.

We can also consider ""BRUSH"": B R U S H -> but we have U and H.

But I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""PRISM"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will guess ""PRISM"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but we are not using any repeats in this guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PRISM"".

<guess>prism</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- We should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., P, I, S, M, B, T, O, U) to maximize information.
- The word should fit the pattern _ R _ _ _.

A strong candidate is ""prism"":
- P (new letter), R (fixed in position 2), I (new vowel), S (new consonant), M (new consonant).
- This tests four new letters while adhering to the feedback constraints.

<guess>prism</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), and C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:
   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning wrong position).
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3? Let's check the positions: 
        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)
        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).
   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it's marked with '-', so wrong position).
   - M is absent (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? 
  Wait, from ""prism"":
    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.
    Position 2: R (fixed)
    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)
    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.
    Position 5: M is absent.

Also, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

And the pattern so far: _ R I _ _

We also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.

Possible positions for P: since it can't be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let's see:
The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.

But position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.

So, the secret word must have:
- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn't at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn't at position 4) and not the absent letters.
- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:

The word has:
- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got '-'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.

But position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? 

Also, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So, the possibilities:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.
- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.
- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that's acceptable.

Wait, let me summarize:
- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don't know yet)
- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that's fine)

But we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.

Similarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.

Now, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn't at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.

But note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let's call it X) at the remaining position.

So, positions:
1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).
2: R
3: I
4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)
5: ? (could be S or P or X)

But we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don't know yet.
- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.

We also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test:
- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.
- Position 4: we don't know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know.

But note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don't have to, but we can. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.

But we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don't put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.

So, to get more information, it's better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.

Therefore, our next guess should have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know, could be S, P, or X.

But we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.

So, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.

So, pattern: X R I P S

But is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

What could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Possible words: 
- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.

But let's think: 
- The word would be ? R I P S
- Possibilities: 
  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.

But wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.

Similarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.

Also, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

So, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested T.

But let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.

Now, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it's valid.

But also, we are testing T.

Alternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.

Another word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested B.

But wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.

But is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.

But note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.

But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.

So, ""trips"" fits: 
- Position 1: T (new letter)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)
- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)

Also, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.

But note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don't know. We are testing it.

Similarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.

Another possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we'd have S R I X P? 

Is there a word like ""SRIP""? No. 

Alternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.

So, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? 

Is there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That's 6 letters. 

What about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.

So, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".

But wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.

Alternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.

What if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.

So, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".

But note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.

If the word is ""trips"", then we might get:
- T: if it's correct, then ✓; otherwise, we'll know.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we'd get '-' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get '-' for P (because it's in the word but not at position 4).

Similarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:
- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn't at position 1)
- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn't at position 4)
- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.

And the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Wait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.

Therefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).

So, depending on where P and S are:
- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.

Thus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we haven't tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:
- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.
- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.

So, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback.

But let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? 

What about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.

Common words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.

Another word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.

""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".

But we don't know about G.

Similarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.

So, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.

But note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.

But since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don't know that for sure yet.

Wait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?

Let me re-express:
- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).
- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.

So, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.

Similarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.

But position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: cannot be S.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". 

Therefore, the word must be * R I P S.

So, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn't form a common word? I don't think so. 

What if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Alternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that's impossible.

Or P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that's fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".

So, I will guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don't know.

But ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.

So, next guess: ""TRIPS"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: T (new)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing)
- Position 5: S (we are testing)

If the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:
- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, '-'. But we don't know if T is in the word.

But if we get:
- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.

But if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.

Otherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.

But we might get information.

Alternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.

""GRIPS""? Not common.

So, ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **R**.
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.
4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:
   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn't position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn't position 4) and cannot be absent letters.
   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).

### Solving Strategy:
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:
  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: I (fixed).
  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).
  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).
- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.
  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.

<guess>trips</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)
Guess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:
  Position 1: T (absent)
  Position 2: R (correct)
  Position 3: I (correct)
  Position 4: P (correct)
  Position 5: S (correct)

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: S

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).

But we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.

So, what letters can be at position 1?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).

Let's list the possible letters: 
- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.

But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That's not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. 

So, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.

Now, what words end with ""RIPS""? 
- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.
- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven't tested B.
- GRIPS: G not excluded.
- DRIPS: D not excluded.
- FRIPS: F not excluded.
- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that's not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.

Actually, common words:
- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.
- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.
- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.
- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.
- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let's stick to common words.

Also, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.

""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.

So, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. 

Alternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. 

Therefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.

So, B, G, D, F are all allowed.

Now, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.

But we need to test the first letter.

Alternatively, we can guess one of these to see.

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.

But let me see: if we guess ""BRIPS"", then:
- If the secret word is ""BRIPS"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback that B is absent? Then we try another.

But we have multiple options. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one unknown letter (position 1) and we know the rest.

But we don't know which of the BRIPS, GRIPS, etc. it is.

So, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far? And the pattern doesn't force duplicates.

But let's check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had P and S present, and in ""trips"" we had P and S correct at positions 4 and 5? And the first letter was T which was absent. So if the secret word were ""BRIPS"", then B is present? But we haven't tested B.

Similarly, we can try ""GRIPS"".

But we can also try to use a word that doesn't fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

So, let's list the possibilities we have: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But ""WRIPS"" might be considered a variant of ""wrip"", but I think it's not standard? Actually, ""wrip"" is the base, but ""wips"" is not a word? So we can exclude it.

Therefore, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have four possibilities. We can try one.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we need to choose one. We can start with the most common one? Or try to test.

But note: we don't have any information about B, G, D, F? So we can pick one arbitrarily.

But we can also consider that in the first guess, we had no information about other letters? Actually, we have been testing letters: crane had C,R,A,N,E; prism had P,R,I,S,M; trips had T,R,I,P,S? But note, in ""trips"", we had T at position 1 (absent) and the rest correct.

So, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don't have any other constraints.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can't use T.

So, let's choose ""BRIPS"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven't tested B? So we can test.

But we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then '-'.
- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.

But if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we'd get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it's not B, and we try G.

Similarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don't have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.

But note: we don't have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it's ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don't know.

Wait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:
- B: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.
- S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.

Similarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- G: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

But if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- D: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

So, we can test one and then proceed.

But we have three possibilities left? Actually, there might be more? What about ""FRIPS""? Or ""WRIPS""? 

Let me list all the common words ending with ""RIPS"" that do not contain T, C, A, N, E, M:
- BRIPS
- GRIPS
- DRIPS
- FRIPS
- PRIPS? Not a word.
- TRIPS? We tried.
- SRIPS? Not a word.

Also, ""THRIPS""? Not a word.

So, four candidates: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We can try ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""BRIPS"".

But we can also note that in the first guess, we had no information about B, G, D, F? So we can test one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and uses a letter that is common to multiple, but we don't have such a word? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me see: we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also consider: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""GRIPS"" and we guess ""BRIPS"", then B is absent? But then we know it's not B, and we try G.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple? Because we don't know the first letter.

So, we have to choose one.

I think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.

So, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.

But I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.

So, I'll guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me double-check: 
- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.
- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.

So, we have to test one.

Therefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".

<guess>brips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C, A, N, E absent (x)  
  - R correct at position 2 (✓)  
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  
  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  
  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)  
  - S present but not at position 4 (-)  
  - M absent (x)  
- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:  
  - T absent (x)  
  - R, I, P, S correct at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (✓)  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed: R, I, P, S).  
2. Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter **not excluded** and **not** P (since P isn't at position 1).  
3. Absent letters: **C, A, N, E, M, T** (from feedback).  
4. Present letters: **P** (position 4) and **S** (position 5), both confirmed in the last guess.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word ends with ""RIPS"".  
- Position 1 must be a letter not in {C, A, N, E, M, T} and not I/S (since I/S are already placed).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **BRIPS**, **GRIPS**, **DRIPS**, **FRIPS**.  

### Strategy:
- With only one unknown letter (position 1) and four possible candidates, we can test **BRIPS** to check if B is the first letter.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm B is absent, narrowing the options to GRIPS, DRIPS, or FRIPS for the next guess.

""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:\n   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it\'s marked with \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).\n   - I is correct and in position 3? Let\'s check the positions: \n        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)\n        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).\n   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it\'s marked with \'-\', so wrong position).\n   - M is absent (x).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? \n  Wait, from ""prism"":\n    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.\n    Position 2: R (fixed)\n    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)\n    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.\n    Position 5: M is absent.\n\nAlso, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nAnd the pattern so far: _ R I _ _\n\nWe also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for P: since it can\'t be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let\'s see:\nThe word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n- Position 2: R (fixed)\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.\n\nTherefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.\n\nSo, the secret word must have:\n- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn\'t at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn\'t at position 4) and not the absent letters.\n- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:\n\nThe word has:\n- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got \'-\'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? \n\nAlso, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.\n\nSo, the possibilities:\n- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.\n- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that\'s acceptable.\n\nWait, let me summarize:\n- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don\'t know yet)\n- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that\'s fine)\n\nBut we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.\n\nNow, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn\'t at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.\n\nBut note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let\'s call it X) at the remaining position.\n\nSo, positions:\n1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).\n2: R\n3: I\n4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)\n5: ? (could be S or P or X)\n\nBut we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.\n\nNow, let\'s consider the constraints:\n- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don\'t know yet.\n- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nWe also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test:\n- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.\n- Position 4: we don\'t know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know.\n\nBut note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don\'t have to, but we can. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.\n\nBut we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don\'t put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn\'t have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.\n\nSo, to get more information, it\'s better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know, could be S, P, or X.\n\nBut we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.\n\nSo, pattern: X R I P S\n\nBut is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nWhat could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.\n\nPossible words: \n- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.\n\nBut let\'s think: \n- The word would be ? R I P S\n- Possibilities: \n  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.\n\nAlso, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nSo, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested T.\n\nBut let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.\n\nNow, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it\'s valid.\n\nBut also, we are testing T.\n\nAlternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.\n\nAnother word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested B.\n\nBut wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.\n\nBut is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.\n\nBut we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.\n\nSo, ""trips"" fits: \n- Position 1: T (new letter)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)\n\nAlso, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don\'t know. We are testing it.\n\nSimilarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.\n\nAnother possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we\'d have S R I X P? \n\nIs there a word like ""SRIP""? No. \n\nAlternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.\n\nSo, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don\'t have evidence for that yet.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? \n\nIs there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That\'s 6 letters. \n\nWhat about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.\n\nSo, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.\n\nAlternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.\n\nWhat if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.\n\nIf the word is ""trips"", then we might get:\n- T: if it\'s correct, then ✓; otherwise, we\'ll know.\n- R: ✓ (position 2)\n- I: ✓ (position 3)\n- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we\'d get \'-\' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get \'-\' for P (because it\'s in the word but not at position 4).\n\nSimilarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:\n- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn\'t at position 1)\n- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn\'t at position 4)\n- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.\n\nAnd the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.\n\nTherefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).\n\nSo, depending on where P and S are:\n- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that\'s impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.\n\nThus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:\n- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.\n- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? \n\nWhat about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.\n\nCommon words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.\n\n""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".\n\nBut we don\'t know about G.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.\n\nBut note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.\n\nBut since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don\'t know that for sure yet.\n\nWait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?\n\nLet me re-express:\n- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).\n- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.\n\nSo, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: cannot be S.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". \n\nTherefore, the word must be * R I P S.\n\nSo, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn\'t form a common word? I don\'t think so. \n\nWhat if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nAlternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that\'s impossible.\n\nOr P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that\'s fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.\n\nTherefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".\n\nSo, I will guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, next guess: ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n- Position 1: T (new)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing)\n\nIf the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:\n- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, \'-\'. But we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nBut if we get:\n- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.\n\nOtherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.\n\nBut we might get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.\n\n""GRIPS""? Not common.\n\nSo, ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.\n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**: \n   - Position 2 must be **R**.\n   - Position 3 must be **I**.\n2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:\n   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.\n3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.\n4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:\n   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn\'t position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn\'t position 4) and cannot be absent letters.\n   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).\n\n### Solving Strategy:\n- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:\n  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).\n  - Position 2: R (fixed).\n  - Position 3: I (fixed).\n  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).\n  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).\n- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:\n  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.\n  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)\nGuess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\nThis means:\n- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.\n- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:\n  Position 1: T (absent)\n  Position 2: R (correct)\n  Position 3: I (correct)\n  Position 4: P (correct)\n  Position 5: S (correct)\n\nSo, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: P\n- Position 5: S\n\nTherefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).\n\nBut we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.\n\nSo, what letters can be at position 1?\n- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".\n- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).\n\nLet\'s list the possible letters: \n- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That\'s not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. \n\nSo, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.\n\nNow, what words end with ""RIPS""? \n- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.\n- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven\'t tested B.\n- GRIPS: G not excluded.\n- DRIPS: D not excluded.\n- FRIPS: F not excluded.\n- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that\'s not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.\n\nActually, common words:\n- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.\n- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.\n- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.\n- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.\n- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAlso, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.\n\n""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.\n\nSo, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. \n\nAlternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.\n\nSo, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. \n\nTherefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.\n\nSo, B, G, D, F are all allowed.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.\n\nBut we need to test the first letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess one of these to see.\n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.\n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""BRIPS"", then:\n- If the secret word is ""BRIPS"", we win.\n- If not, then we get feedback that B is absent? Then we try another.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one unknown letter (position 1) and we know the rest.\n\nBut we don\'t know which of the BRIPS, GRIPS, etc. it is.\n\nSo, we can guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far? And the pattern doesn\'t force duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had P and S present, and in ""trips"" we had P and S correct at positions 4 and 5? And the first letter was T which was absent. So if the secret word were ""BRIPS"", then B is present? But we haven\'t tested B.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""GRIPS"".\n\nBut we can also try to use a word that doesn\'t fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities we have: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But ""WRIPS"" might be considered a variant of ""wrip"", but I think it\'s not standard? Actually, ""wrip"" is the base, but ""wips"" is not a word? So we can exclude it.\n\nTherefore, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nWe have four possibilities. We can try one.\n\nBut we have three guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut we need to choose one. We can start with the most common one? Or try to test.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any information about B, G, D, F? So we can pick one arbitrarily.\n\nBut we can also consider that in the first guess, we had no information about other letters? Actually, we have been testing letters: crane had C,R,A,N,E; prism had P,R,I,S,M; trips had T,R,I,P,S? But note, in ""trips"", we had T at position 1 (absent) and the rest correct.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it\'s wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.\n\nBut we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don\'t have any other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can\'t use T.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven\'t tested B? So we can test.\n\nBut we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:\n- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then \'-\'.\n- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we\'d get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it\'s not B, and we try G.\n\nSimilarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.\n\nBut we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don\'t have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".\n\nBut to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:\n- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it\'s ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nWait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:\n- B: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.\n- S: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:\n- G: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓\n- S: ✓\nSame feedback.\n\nBut if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:\n- D: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓\n- S: ✓\nSame feedback.\n\nSo, we can test one and then proceed.\n\nBut we have three possibilities left? Actually, there might be more? What about ""FRIPS""? Or ""WRIPS""? \n\nLet me list all the common words ending with ""RIPS"" that do not contain T, C, A, N, E, M:\n- BRIPS\n- GRIPS\n- DRIPS\n- FRIPS\n- PRIPS? Not a word.\n- TRIPS? We tried.\n- SRIPS? Not a word.\n\nAlso, ""THRIPS""? Not a word.\n\nSo, four candidates: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nWe can try ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut we can also note that in the first guess, we had no information about B, G, D, F? So we can test one.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and uses a letter that is common to multiple, but we don\'t have such a word? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me see: we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.\n\nBut we can also consider: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""GRIPS"" and we guess ""BRIPS"", then B is absent? But then we know it\'s not B, and we try G.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests multiple? Because we don\'t know the first letter.\n\nSo, we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.\n\nBut I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don\'t know.\n- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don\'t know.\n\nSo, we have to test one.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".\n\n<guess>brips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  \n  - C, A, N, E absent (x)  \n  - R correct at position 2 (✓)  \n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  \n  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  \n  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)  \n  - S present but not at position 4 (-)  \n  - M absent (x)  \n- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:  \n  - T absent (x)  \n  - R, I, P, S correct at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (✓)  \n\n### Deductions:\n1.

We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""brips"" -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- B is absent (x) → so B is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → confirming our deduction that positions 2,3,4,5 are R, I, P, S respectively.

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, and B is absent → so it's not ""brips"".

Now, we have:
- Known letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4), S (pos5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The only remaining unknown is position 1.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? R I P S, where ? is a letter not in the absent list and not I/S (since I/S are already placed and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence for duplicates, so we avoid for now).

Possible letters for position 1: 
- We must avoid: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The word must be a valid English word.

Common words:
- ""GRIPS"": G R I P S → G is not excluded? We haven't tested G.
- ""DRIPS"": D R I P S → D not tested.
- ""FRIPS"": F R I P S → F not tested.

Also, less common: ""PRIPS""? Not a word. ""WRIPS""? Not a word. ""KRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the candidates are: GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have three possibilities. We can try one of them.

We have two guesses left? Actually, we have used 4 guesses, so 2 left? But we can solve in this guess.

We can try ""GRIPS"".

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""GRIPS"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that G is absent? Then we know it's one of the other two: DRIPS or FRIPS.

Similarly, we could try ""DRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But we don't have any information about D or F? So we can choose arbitrarily.

I think ""GRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had no G, D, F? So we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and has G, D, F? That would be difficult? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to guess one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""GRIPS"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? G is not in the absent list? So yes.

Therefore, the next guess is ""GRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word has a duplicate letter? We don't have any indication? But we can avoid for now.

So, <guess>grips</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed as R, I, P, S).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, M, T, B (from feedback).
- **Position 1 constraints**: 
  - Cannot be P (since P is confirmed at position 4).
  - Cannot be R, I, S (since they are already placed in positions 2, 3, and 5).
  - Must be a letter not in the absent list.

The only remaining common English words fitting this pattern are **GRIPS**, **DRIPS**, and **FRIPS**. 

### Reasoning:
- **GRIPS**: G is a new letter not excluded by previous feedback.
- **DRIPS**: D is a new letter not excluded.
- **FRIPS**: F is a new letter not excluded.

All other possibilities (e.g., ""PRIPS"", ""WRIPS"") are invalid words.

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Since only position 1 is unknown, we can test one of these candidates directly.
- ""GRIPS"" is a common word and a reasonable choice.

If ""GRIPS"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm G's absence, leaving **DRIPS** or **FRIPS** as options for the next guess.

<guess>grips</guess>",grips,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""brips"" -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- B is absent (x) → so B is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → confirming our deduction that positions 2,3,4,5 are R, I, P, S respectively.

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, and B is absent → so it's not ""brips"".

Now, we have:
- Known letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4), S (pos5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The only remaining unknown is position 1.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? R I P S, where ? is a letter not in the absent list and not I/S (since I/S are already placed and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence for duplicates, so we avoid for now).

Possible letters for position 1: 
- We must avoid: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The word must be a valid English word.

Common words:
- ""GRIPS"": G R I P S → G is not excluded? We haven't tested G.
- ""DRIPS"": D R I P S → D not tested.
- ""FRIPS"": F R I P S → F not tested.

Also, less common: ""PRIPS""? Not a word. ""WRIPS""? Not a word. ""KRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the candidates are: GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have three possibilities. We can try one of them.

We can try ""GRIPS"".

So, <guess>grips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter of the secret word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in our next guess.

We should try to use other common letters to get more information.

Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we have I, O, U. But note that we have only one vowel so far (A and E are absent, but R is present and we know it's in the second position).

We can try a word that has:
- First letter: not C, A, N, E, and preferably a common consonant.
- Third, fourth, fifth: similar, avoiding the absent letters.

We also note that we have no information about other positions.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and do not contain C, A, N, E.

Some possibilities:
- BRUSH: B R U S H -> but we don't know if B, U, S, H are in the word.
- GRIMY: G R I M Y -> G, I, M, Y are new.
- PROUD: P R O U D -> P, O, U, D are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

We might also consider that the word must have R in the second position.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ _ and don't have C, A, N, E.

Other common words: 
- TRYST: T R Y S T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's valid. But let's see if it has any forbidden letter? No, T, R, Y, S are allowed because C,A,N,E are the only ones excluded.
But we have to be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P R O W L -> no forbidden letters.

But we might also consider words that have double letters? But we don't know, so avoid double letters for now.

Alternatively, we can try ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> but O and I are vowels we haven't tried.

We haven't tried O, I, U, and other vowels. We also haven't tried many consonants.

We can also try ""TRYST"" or ""PRISM"".

But note: we have R fixed in the second position.

Let me think of a word that has new letters and common ones.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate:
- P R I S M -> P, I, S, M are all new and common.

But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. ""PRISM"" does not contain any of these.

Similarly, ""BRISK"" is another candidate: B R I S K.

But we don't know if B, I, S, K are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> T, I, P, S are new.

But we have to make sure the word is valid.

I think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get information about P, I, S, M.

Another option: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden (we know N is absent from the first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C and we know C is absent.

So, let's go with ""PRISM"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has double letters, but we can avoid them for now.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRUTH"": T R U T H -> but it has T twice. It's valid, but we are wasting a letter slot. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

So, ""PRISM"" is better because it has 4 new distinct letters: P, I, S, M.

We can also consider ""BRUSH"": B R U S H -> but we have U and H.

But I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice.

Let me check if ""PRISM"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

So, I will guess ""PRISM"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know, but we are not using any repeats in this guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""PRISM"".

<guess>prism</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _, and it does not contain C, A, N, or E.

For the next guess:
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- We should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., P, I, S, M, B, T, O, U) to maximize information.
- The word should fit the pattern _ R _ _ _.

A strong candidate is ""prism"":
- P (new letter), R (fixed in position 2), I (new vowel), S (new consonant), M (new consonant).
- This tests four new letters while adhering to the feedback constraints.

<guess>prism</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd), and C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""prism"": P(-), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), M(x) → Interpretation:
   - P is present in the word but not in the first position (since it's marked with '-', meaning wrong position).
   - R is correct and in position 2 (as before).
   - I is correct and in position 3? Let's check the positions: 
        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)
        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).
   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it's marked with '-', so wrong position).
   - M is absent (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? 
  Wait, from ""prism"":
    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.
    Position 2: R (fixed)
    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)
    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.
    Position 5: M is absent.

Also, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.

So the secret word has:
- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

And the pattern so far: _ R I _ _

We also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.

Possible positions for P: since it can't be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let's see:
The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.

But position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.

Therefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.

So, the secret word must have:
- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn't at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn't at position 4) and not the absent letters.
- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:

The word has:
- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got '-'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.

But position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? 

Also, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.

So, the possibilities:
- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.
- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.
- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that's acceptable.

Wait, let me summarize:
- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don't know yet)
- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that's fine)

But we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.

Similarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.

Now, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn't at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.

But note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let's call it X) at the remaining position.

So, positions:
1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).
2: R
3: I
4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)
5: ? (could be S or P or X)

But we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.

Now, let's consider the constraints:
- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don't know yet.
- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.

We also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.

Now, for our next guess, we want to test:
- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.
- Position 4: we don't know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know.

But note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don't have to, but we can. However, the rules don't require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.

But we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don't put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn't have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.

So, to get more information, it's better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.

Therefore, our next guess should have:
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?
- Position 5: we don't know, could be S, P, or X.

But we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.

So, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.

So, pattern: X R I P S

But is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

What could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.

Possible words: 
- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.

But let's think: 
- The word would be ? R I P S
- Possibilities: 
  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.

But wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.

Similarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.

Also, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.

So, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested T.

But let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.

Now, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it's valid.

But also, we are testing T.

Alternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.

Another word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven't tested B.

But wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.

But is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.

But note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.

But we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.

So, ""trips"" fits: 
- Position 1: T (new letter)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)
- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)

Also, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.

But note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don't know. We are testing it.

Similarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.

Another possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we'd have S R I X P? 

Is there a word like ""SRIP""? No. 

Alternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.

So, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don't have evidence for that yet.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? 

Is there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That's 6 letters. 

What about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.

So, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".

But wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.

Alternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.

What if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.

So, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".

But note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.

If the word is ""trips"", then we might get:
- T: if it's correct, then ✓; otherwise, we'll know.
- R: ✓ (position 2)
- I: ✓ (position 3)
- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we'd get '-' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get '-' for P (because it's in the word but not at position 4).

Similarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we'd get '-' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don't know.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.

Since we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.

But note, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:
- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn't at position 1)
- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn't at position 4)
- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.

And the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don't know about other letters.

Wait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.

Therefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.

So, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).

The secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).

So, depending on where P and S are:
- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.
- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.

Thus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we haven't tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:
- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.
- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.

So, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.

Otherwise, we get feedback.

But let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? 

What about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.

Common words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.

Another word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.

""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".

But we don't know about G.

Similarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.

So, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.

Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.

But note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.

But since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don't know that for sure yet.

Wait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?

Let me re-express:
- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).
- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.

So, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.

Similarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.

But position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got '-', meaning it's in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.

Similarly, position 4: cannot be S.

Therefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". 

Therefore, the word must be * R I P S.

So, we can guess ""TRIPS"".

But what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn't form a common word? I don't think so. 

What if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Alternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that's impossible.

Or P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that's fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".

So, I will guess ""TRIPS"".

But note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don't know.

But ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.

So, next guess: ""TRIPS"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
- Position 1: T (new)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: I (correct)
- Position 4: P (we are testing)
- Position 5: S (we are testing)

If the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:
- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, '-'. But we don't know if T is in the word.

But if we get:
- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.

But if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.

Otherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.

But we might get information.

Alternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.

""GRIPS""? Not common.

So, ""TRIPS"" is the word.

Therefore, I'll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **R**.
   - Position 3 must be **I**.
2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:
   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.
   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback). Given positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be at position 1 or 5.
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E (from ""crane""), M (from ""prism""). Avoid these in future guesses.
4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:
   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn't position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn't position 4) and cannot be absent letters.
   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).

### Solving Strategy:
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:
  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: I (fixed).
  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).
  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).
- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:
  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.
  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.

<guess>trips</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)
Guess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:
  Position 1: T (absent)
  Position 2: R (correct)
  Position 3: I (correct)
  Position 4: P (correct)
  Position 5: S (correct)

So, the secret word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: S

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).

But we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.

So, what letters can be at position 1?
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".
- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).

Let's list the possible letters: 
- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.

But the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That's not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. 

So, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.

Now, what words end with ""RIPS""? 
- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.
- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven't tested B.
- GRIPS: G not excluded.
- DRIPS: D not excluded.
- FRIPS: F not excluded.
- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that's not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.

Actually, common words:
- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.
- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.
- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.
- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.
- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let's stick to common words.

Also, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.

""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.

So, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. 

Alternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. 

Therefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.

So, B, G, D, F are all allowed.

Now, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.

But we need to test the first letter.

Alternatively, we can guess one of these to see.

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.

But let me see: if we guess ""BRIPS"", then:
- If the secret word is ""BRIPS"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback that B is absent? Then we try another.

But we have multiple options. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one unknown letter (position 1) and we know the rest.

But we don't know which of the BRIPS, GRIPS, etc. it is.

So, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far? And the pattern doesn't force duplicates.

But let's check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had P and S present, and in ""trips"" we had P and S correct at positions 4 and 5? And the first letter was T which was absent. So if the secret word were ""BRIPS"", then B is present? But we haven't tested B.

Similarly, we can try ""GRIPS"".

But we can also try to use a word that doesn't fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

So, let's list the possibilities we have: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But ""WRIPS"" might be considered a variant of ""wrip"", but I think it's not standard? Actually, ""wrip"" is the base, but ""wips"" is not a word? So we can exclude it.

Therefore, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have four possibilities. We can try one.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we need to choose one. We can start with the most common one? Or try to test.

But note: we don't have any information about B, G, D, F? So we can pick one arbitrarily.

But we can also consider that in the first guess, we had no information about other letters? Actually, we have been testing letters: crane had C,R,A,N,E; prism had P,R,I,S,M; trips had T,R,I,P,S? But note, in ""trips"", we had T at position 1 (absent) and the rest correct.

So, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don't have any other constraints.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can't use T.

So, let's choose ""BRIPS"".

But note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven't tested B? So we can test.

But we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then '-'.
- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.

But if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we'd get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it's not B, and we try G.

Similarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.

But we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don't have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.

But note: we don't have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:
- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it's ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don't know.

Wait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:
- B: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.
- S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.

Similarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- G: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

But if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:
- D: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓
Same feedback.

So, we can test one and then proceed.

But we have three possibilities left? Actually, there might be more? What about ""FRIPS""? Or ""WRIPS""? 

Let me list all the common words ending with ""RIPS"" that do not contain T, C, A, N, E, M:
- BRIPS
- GRIPS
- DRIPS
- FRIPS
- PRIPS? Not a word.
- TRIPS? We tried.
- SRIPS? Not a word.

Also, ""THRIPS""? Not a word.

So, four candidates: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We can try ""BRIPS"".

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""BRIPS"".

But we can also note that in the first guess, we had no information about B, G, D, F? So we can test one.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and uses a letter that is common to multiple, but we don't have such a word? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me see: we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.

But if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.

But we can also consider: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""GRIPS"" and we guess ""BRIPS"", then B is absent? But then we know it's not B, and we try G.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple? Because we don't know the first letter.

So, we have to choose one.

I think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.

So, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.

But I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.

So, I'll guess ""BRIPS"".

But let me double-check: 
- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.
- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don't know.

So, we have to test one.

Therefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".

<guess>brips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - C, A, N, E absent (x)  
  - R correct at position 2 (✓)  
- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  
  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  
  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)  
  - S present but not at position 4 (-)  
  - M absent (x)  
- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:  
  - T absent (x)  
  - R, I, P, S correct at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (✓)  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed: R, I, P, S).  
2. Position 1 is unknown but must be a letter **not excluded** and **not** P (since P isn't at position 1).  
3. Absent letters: **C, A, N, E, M, T** (from feedback).  
4. Present letters: **P** (position 4) and **S** (position 5), both confirmed in the last guess.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word ends with ""RIPS"".  
- Position 1 must be a letter not in {C, A, N, E, M, T} and not I/S (since I/S are already placed).  
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **BRIPS**, **GRIPS**, **DRIPS**, **FRIPS**.  

### Strategy:
- With only one unknown letter (position 1) and four possible candidates, we can test **BRIPS** to check if B is the first letter.  
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback will confirm B is absent, narrowing the options to GRIPS, DRIPS, or FRIPS for the next guess.

<guess>brips</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)
Guess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: brips -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""brips"" -> B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- B is absent (x) → so B is not in the secret word.
- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → confirming our deduction that positions 2,3,4,5 are R, I, P, S respectively.

Therefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, and B is absent → so it's not ""brips"".

Now, we have:
- Known letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4), S (pos5).
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The only remaining unknown is position 1.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ? R I P S, where ? is a letter not in the absent list and not I/S (since I/S are already placed and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence for duplicates, so we avoid for now).

Possible letters for position 1: 
- We must avoid: C, A, N, E, M, T, B.
- The word must be a valid English word.

Common words:
- ""GRIPS"": G R I P S → G is not excluded? We haven't tested G.
- ""DRIPS"": D R I P S → D not tested.
- ""FRIPS"": F R I P S → F not tested.

Also, less common: ""PRIPS""? Not a word. ""WRIPS""? Not a word. ""KRIPS""? Not a word.

So, the candidates are: GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.

We have three possibilities. We can try one of them.

We have two guesses left? Actually, we have used 4 guesses, so 2 left? But we can solve in this guess.

We can try ""GRIPS"".

But note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""GRIPS"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that G is absent? Then we know it's one of the other two: DRIPS or FRIPS.

Similarly, we could try ""DRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".

But we don't have any information about D or F? So we can choose arbitrarily.

I think ""GRIPS"" is a common word? So I'll go with that.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had no G, D, F? So we don't know.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that tests multiple? But we don't have a word that fits the pattern and has G, D, F? That would be difficult? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to guess one of the candidates.

So, I think we should guess ""GRIPS"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters? G is not in the absent list? So yes.

Therefore, the next guess is ""GRIPS"".

But wait, what if the word has a duplicate letter? We don't have any indication? But we can avoid for now.

So, <guess>grips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed as R, I, P, S).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, M, T, B (from feedback).
- **Position 1 constraints**: 
  - Cannot be P (since P is confirmed at position 4).
  - Cannot be R, I, S (since they are already placed in positions 2, 3, and 5).
  - Must be a letter not in the absent list.

The only remaining common English words fitting this pattern are **GRIPS**, **DRIPS**, and **FRIPS**. 

### Reasoning:
- **GRIPS**: G is a new letter not excluded by previous feedback.
- **DRIPS**: D is a new letter not excluded.
- **FRIPS**: F is a new letter not excluded.

All other possibilities (e.g., ""PRIPS"", ""WRIPS"") are invalid words.

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Since only position 1 is unknown, we can test one of these candidates directly.
- ""GRIPS"" is a common word and a reasonable choice.

If ""GRIPS"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm G's absence, leaving **DRIPS** or **FRIPS** as options for the next guess.

Actually, it\'s valid. But let\'s see if it has any forbidden letter? No, T, R, Y, S are allowed because C,A,N,E are the only ones excluded.\nBut we have to be cautious: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that A and E are absent, so we must avoid them.\n\nAnother word: ""PROWL"" -> P R O W L -> no forbidden letters.\n\nBut we might also consider words that have double letters? But we don\'t know, so avoid double letters for now.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BROIL"": B R O I L -> but O and I are vowels we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, I, U, and other vowels. We also haven\'t tried many consonants.\n\nWe can also try ""TRYST"" or ""PRISM"".\n\nBut note: we have R fixed in the second position.\n\nLet me think of a word that has new letters and common ones.\n\nI think ""PRISM"" is a good candidate:\n- P R I S M -> P, I, S, M are all new and common.\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. ""PRISM"" does not contain any of these.\n\nSimilarly, ""BRISK"" is another candidate: B R I S K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, I, S, K are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> T, I, P, S are new.\n\nBut we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\nI think ""PRISM"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can get information about P, I, S, M.\n\nAnother option: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden (we know N is absent from the first guess). So we cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRUST"" has C and we know C is absent.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PRISM"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has double letters, but we can avoid them for now.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""TRUTH"": T R U T H -> but it has T twice. It\'s valid, but we are wasting a letter slot. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nSo, ""PRISM"" is better because it has 4 new distinct letters: P, I, S, M.\n\nWe can also consider ""BRUSH"": B R U S H -> but we have U and H.\n\nBut I think ""PRISM"" is a solid choice.\n\nLet me check if ""PRISM"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nSo, I will guess ""PRISM"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters?

Let\'s check the positions: \n        prism: P (1), R (2), I (3), S (4), M (5)\n        So I is in position 3 and is correct (✓).\n   - S is present but not in position 4 (since it\'s marked with \'-\', so wrong position).\n   - M is absent (x).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n- The secret word has the form: _ R I _ _ ? \n  Wait, from ""prism"":\n    Position 1: P is present but wrong position → so P must be in the word, but not at position 1.\n    Position 2: R (fixed)\n    Position 3: I (fixed, from the ✓)\n    Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in the word, but not at position 4.\n    Position 5: M is absent.\n\nAlso, from first guess, we know that C, A, N, E are absent.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), and also P and S (since they are present, but not in the positions we tried).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nAnd the pattern so far: _ R I _ _\n\nWe also know that P is in the word, but not at position 1. Similarly, S is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\nPossible positions for P: since it can\'t be at 1, and positions 2,3,4,5 are taken by R, I, S (which is also misplaced), P must be at position 5? Or position 4? Let\'s see:\nThe word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n- Position 2: R (fixed)\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: S is present but not here → so S must be in one of positions 1, 4, or 5? But wait, we also have P that must be in the word and not at position 1.\n\nBut position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""prism""), and S must be elsewhere. The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 1: we know P is not there (because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there). So S cannot be at position 4, and P cannot be at position 1.\n\nTherefore, S must be at position 5? Or could there be more letters? No, the word is 5 letters.\n\nSo, the secret word must have:\n- Position 1: some letter that is not C, A, N, E, M, and also not P (because P isn\'t at position 1) and not R or I (since they are at 2 and 3).\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: some letter that is not S (since S isn\'t at position 4) and not the absent letters.\n- Position 5: S? Or could S be at position 1? Let me re-express:\n\nThe word has:\n- P is present → so P must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 cannot be P (because we tried it and got \'-\'), so P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nBut position 4: we know S is not at position 4 (from ""prism"" feedback), but P could be at position 4? Or position 5? \n\nAlso, S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed for S (as per feedback) and position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I.\n\nSo, the possibilities:\n- Position 1: cannot be P (because P is misplaced from position 1), and must be a letter not excluded. Excluded letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n- Position 4: could be P? Or S? But S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism""), so S must be at position 1 or 5.\n- Position 5: could be S? Or P? But P must be in the word and cannot be at position 1, so if position 5 is S, that\'s acceptable.\n\nWait, let me summarize:\n- Known letters in word: R, I, P, S (since P and S are present, just misplaced).\n- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: ? (cannot be S, and we don\'t know yet)\n- Position 5: ? (could be S or P, but note P cannot be at position 1 so if P is at 5, that\'s fine)\n\nBut we also know that P is present → so P must be at position 4 or 5? Because position 1 is not allowed for P.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → so S must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is not allowed.\n\nNow, position 4: it cannot be S (because S isn\'t at position 4) and cannot be the absent letters. Also, it could be P? Or another letter.\n\nBut note, we have two letters that must be placed: P and S. And one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must contain R, I, P, S, and one more letter? Since R and I are fixed, and we have P and S to place, plus one more letter.\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (somewhere, not pos1), S (somewhere, not pos4), and one more letter (let\'s call it X) at the remaining position.\n\nSo, positions:\n1: cannot be P, and must be either S or X (the new letter).\n2: R\n3: I\n4: ? (could be P or X, but not S)\n5: ? (could be S or P or X)\n\nBut we know that S must be at position 1 or 5, and P must be at position 4 or 5? But wait, position 5 could be S or P, and position 4 could be P or X.\n\nNow, let\'s consider the constraints:\n- P must be in the word → so in ""prism"", P was at position 1 (wrong), at position 4? Or position 5? We don\'t know yet.\n- Similarly, S must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nWe also have the feedback that S is not at position 4 (already known) and P is not at position 1.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we want to test:\n- We know positions 2 and 3: R and I.\n- Position 4: we don\'t know, so we can try to put P there? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know.\n\nBut note, we must include the known letters? Actually, we must include R and I in their positions because they are fixed? No, we don\'t have to, but we can. However, the rules don\'t require that we use known letters in the next guess? Actually, we can use any word, but using known letters might help.\n\nBut we know R and I are in positions 2 and 3, so if we don\'t put R at position 2 and I at position 3 in the next guess, we might get wrong feedback? Actually, the feedback will show if the letters are correct. But since we know they are correct, we can use a word that doesn\'t have R at 2 or I at 3? But that would be inefficient because we would get ✓ for R and I regardless.\n\nSo, to get more information, it\'s better to keep R and I in positions 2 and 3 and try to find the remaining letters.\n\nTherefore, our next guess should have:\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: we want to try P? Or the new letter X?\n- Position 5: we don\'t know, could be S, P, or X.\n\nBut we also want to test S? We know S is present but not at position 4. So we can put S at position 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n\nSo, let us consider putting P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then position 1 would be a new letter X.\n\nSo, pattern: X R I P S\n\nBut is that a word? We need a 5-letter word with R at 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nWhat could X be? It cannot be C, A, N, E, M. Also, it must be a letter that forms a valid word.\n\nPossible words: \n- FRIPS? But F is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested F. However, in ""prism"" we used P,R,I,S,M. So F is new.\n\nBut let\'s think: \n- The word would be ? R I P S\n- Possibilities: \n  - TRIPS? But T is not excluded. However, note that in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S? That would be T R I P S → which is a word.\n\nBut wait, we also have to consider that P is present: if we put P at position 4, that would be consistent because in ""prism"" P was at position 1 and was wrong, but now we put it at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 5: in ""prism"", S was at position 4 and was wrong, so now we put it at position 5.\n\nAlso, we need to pick a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid word.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M.\n\nSo, TRIPS: T is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested T.\n\nBut let me check: in ""trips"", the letters are T, R, I, P, S.\n\nNow, we know that P and S are present (from previous feedback), so it\'s valid.\n\nBut also, we are testing T.\n\nAlternatively, we could try PRISM again? But we already tried it and got P(-), M(x), and we know M is absent.\n\nAnother word: BRIPS? But B is not excluded? But note, we haven\'t tested B.\n\nBut wait, in the pattern, if we put S at position 5, then position 4 must be P? Because we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5.\n\nBut is there a word like X R I P S? Yes, ""trips"" is one.\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", position 4 is P and position 5 is S.\n\nBut we must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, in ""trips"", S is at position 5, not 4. Position 4 is P.\n\nSo, ""trips"" fits: \n- Position 1: T (new letter)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing if P is here)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing if S is here)\n\nAlso, we avoid the absent letters: no C, A, N, E, M.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that P might not be at position 4? We don\'t know. We are testing it.\n\nSimilarly, S might not be at position 5? But we are testing.\n\nAnother possibility: what if P is at position 5? Then we need a word that has _ R I _ P? But then S would have to be at position 1? So we\'d have S R I X P? \n\nIs there a word like ""SRIP""? No. \n\nAlternatively, what if S is at position 1 and P at position 5? Then the word would be S R I X P? Again, not a common word.\n\nSo, the word ""trips"" is a valid option.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? We don\'t have evidence for that yet.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses S at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the word would be S R I P ? \n\nIs there a word? ""SRIP"" is not a word. ""STRIP"" → S R T R I P? That\'s 6 letters. \n\nWhat about ""SHRIP""? Not a word.\n\nSo, the only common word that fits the pattern if we put P at position 4 and S at position 5 is ""trips"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has S at position 1? Then we need a word that starts with S and has R at 2, I at 3, then P at 4 and S at 5? But S at position 5 is fine, but position 1 is S? Then the word is S R I P S? That would be ""SRIPS"", which is not a word.\n\nAlternatively, S at position 5 and P at position 4: that would be X R I P S → ""trips"" is one.\n\nWhat if P is at position 5? Then we need S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P → ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""STRIP"" is 6 letters.\n\nSo, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word must be ? R I P S.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: in ""trips"", we are putting P at position 4 and S at position 5. We are testing T at position 1.\n\nIf the word is ""trips"", then we might get:\n- T: if it\'s correct, then ✓; otherwise, we\'ll know.\n- R: ✓ (position 2)\n- I: ✓ (position 3)\n- P: if the secret word has P at position 4, then ✓; otherwise, if P is at position 5, then we\'d get \'-\' for P? But wait, we know P is present, and if we put P at position 4 and the secret word has P at position 5, then we would get \'-\' for P (because it\'s in the word but not at position 4).\n\nSimilarly, S: if the secret word has S at position 5, then ✓; otherwise, if S is at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Because S is present but not at position 5? But wait, we know S is present, and if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? Actually, the feedback would mark S as \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 5? But it is at position 1? Then we\'d get \'-\' for S at position 5? And for T, if T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t fix P and S? But that might be inefficient.\n\nSince we have three letters fixed (R, I, and the two known present letters P and S) and only two positions unknown (position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 and position 5), we can try to guess the word by filling position 1 and 4,5? But we have to use the known constraints.\n\nBut note, we must avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo, the word must be: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5], with the constraints:\n- letter1 ≠ P (because P isn\'t at position 1)\n- letter4 ≠ S (because S isn\'t at position 4)\n- letter5 ≠ M (absent) and not C,A,N,E.\n\nAnd the letters must include P and S? Actually, we know P and S are in the word, but we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWait, the secret word must contain P and S? Yes, because they are present.\n\nTherefore, the word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, positions 1,4,5 must be filled with letters that include P and S? Not necessarily, because we have two known letters (P and S) and one unknown letter (X).\n\nThe secret word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), P (pos4 or pos5), S (pos1 or pos5), and X (the remaining letter at the other position).\n\nSo, depending on where P and S are:\n- If P is at position 4 and S at position 5: then the word is X R I P S.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 1: then the word is S R I X P? But that would be ""srip""? Not a word. Or ""strip""? Not a word.\n- If P is at position 5 and S at position 4: but S cannot be at position 4 (feedback from ""prism"" told us S is not at position 4), so that\'s impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word is ? R I P S.\n\nThus, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested T. So if we guess ""TRIPS"", we might get:\n- T: if the secret word has T, then ✓; otherwise, if T is absent, then x.\n- But we know the secret word has P and S, and R and I.\n\nSo, if the secret word is ""trips"", then we win.\n\nOtherwise, we get feedback.\n\nBut let me confirm: are there any other words that fit the pattern? \n\nWhat about ""DRIPS""? But D is not excluded? But then D R I P S → that would be ""drips"", which is a word? Actually, ""drips"" is not common; it might be ""DRIPS"" meaning something? Or ""DRIVE""? No, that has V.\n\nCommon words: ""TRIPS"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""CRISP""? But C is excluded (from first guess). So no.\n\n""GRIPS""? G is not excluded? But then G R I P S → ""grips"".\n\nBut we don\'t know about G.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPS"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I think ""TRIPS"" is the best guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we only have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2 guesses, so 4 left? But we can solve it.\n\nBut note: we might not get it right away, but we can use this guess to test.\n\nBut since we have only two unknowns: position 1 and position 4? Actually, position 4 is P in this scenario? But we don\'t know that for sure yet.\n\nWait, we deduced that P must be at position 4 and S at position 5? Is that correct?\n\nLet me re-express:\n- The secret word has P and S (from prism feedback: P and S are present).\n- From crane: no P, so crane was all wrong except R and I? But wait, crane had P? No, crane does not have P? Crane: C,R,A,N,E → no P. But prism has P.\n\nSo, P is present → so in the secret word, P is at position 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, S is present → at position 1 or 5.\n\nBut position 1: cannot be P? Because in prism, P at position 1 got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not there. So P cannot be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, position 4: cannot be S.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that P is at position 4 and S at position 5: so the word ends with ""RIPS""? Actually, position 4 is P and position 5 is S, so the last two letters are ""PS"". \n\nTherefore, the word must be * R I P S.\n\nSo, we can guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I X P → but that doesn\'t form a common word? I don\'t think so. \n\nWhat if the word has P at position 4 and S at position 5? Then ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nAlternatively, what if the word has P at position 5 and S at position 4? But S cannot be at position 4 (from feedback) → so that\'s impossible.\n\nOr P at position 4 and S at position 1? Then the word is S R I P ? → but then S is at position 1 and P at position 4? Then the last letter is unknown? But we have to avoid S at position 4? Position 4 is P, so that\'s fine. But what word? ""STRIP"" is not a word? ""SHRIP"" not a word.\n\nTherefore, the only common word that fits is ""TRIPS"".\n\nSo, I will guess ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we are testing T. If T is in the word? We don\'t know.\n\nBut ""TRIPS"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, next guess: ""TRIPS"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n- Position 1: T (new)\n- Position 2: R (correct)\n- Position 3: I (correct)\n- Position 4: P (we are testing)\n- Position 5: S (we are testing)\n\nIf the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then:\n- T: if correct, ✓; otherwise, if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, \'-\'. But we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n\nBut if we get:\n- T at position 1: if ✓, then we have all letters? Or if x, then we know T is absent.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""TRIPS"", then T would be ✓.\n\nOtherwise, if T is absent, then we get x for T.\n\nBut we might get information.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""BRIPS""? But B is not tested? But then B R I P S → ""brips"" is not a word? ""BRIPS""? Not a word.\n\n""GRIPS""? Not common.\n\nSo, ""TRIPS"" is the word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""TRIPS"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent (x), R is correct at position 2 (✓), and no other letters were present.\n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**: P is present but not at position 1 (-), R and I are correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓), S is present but not at position 4 (-), and M is absent (x).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**: \n   - Position 2 must be **R**.\n   - Position 3 must be **I**.\n2. **Present letters (but position unknown)**:\n   - **P** is in the word but not at position 1 (from ""prism"" feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, P must be at position 4 or 5.\n   - **S** is in the word but not at position 4 (same feedback).

Avoid these in future guesses.\n4. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ R I _ _`, with:\n   - Position 1: Cannot be P (since P isn\'t position 1) and must be a letter not excluded. Possible candidates: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Position 4: Unknown, but cannot be S (since S isn\'t position 4) and cannot be absent letters.\n   - Position 5: Unknown, but cannot be absent letters, and S must be at position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is invalid for S).\n\n### Solving Strategy:\n- The only common English word fitting `_ R I _ _` with the constraints is **""TRIPS""**:\n  - Position 1: T (new letter, tests for presence).\n  - Position 2: R (fixed).\n  - Position 3: I (fixed).\n  - Position 4: P (tests if P is here).\n  - Position 5: S (tests if S is here).\n- This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities:\n  - If P is at position 4 and S at position 5, ""TRIPS"" could be the solution.\n  - If not, feedback will reveal the true positions of P and S and the presence of T.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: prism -> FEEDBACK: P(-) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x)\nGuess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""trips"" -> T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\nThis means:\n- T is absent (x) → so T is not in the secret word.\n- R, I, P, S are all in the correct positions (✓) → which confirms our deduction that the word has R at position 2, I at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But wait, in ""trips"", the positions are:\n  Position 1: T (absent)\n  Position 2: R (correct)\n  Position 3: I (correct)\n  Position 4: P (correct)\n  Position 5: S (correct)\n\nSo, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: unknown (but T is absent, so not T)\n- Position 2: R\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: P\n- Position 5: S\n\nTherefore, the secret word is ? R I P S, with the first letter being a letter that is not T, and also not any of the previously absent letters (C, A, N, E, M).\n\nBut we already knew from previous feedback that the word must end with ""RIPS"", and now we know position 1 is not T.\n\nSo, what letters can be at position 1?\n- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""RIPS"".\n- It cannot be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T (from Guess 1, 2, and 3).\n\nLet\'s list the possible letters: \n- Alphabet minus absent letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- But note: I and S are already in the word? But we are putting them at positions 3 and 5? Actually, the word has I at position 3 and S at position 5, so the first letter must be a letter that is not I or S? Because if it were I or S, we would have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the feedback for ""prism"", we had no duplicate letters, and ""trips"" has no duplicates.\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicates? We don\'t have evidence against it, but in this case, since we have I and S already placed, the first letter must be a new letter? Not necessarily, because it could be I or S? But if it were I, then the word would be I R I P S? That\'s not a word. Similarly, if it were S, then S R I P S? That would be ""srip"" or ""stris"" — not a word. \n\nSo, the first letter must be a different letter, not I, S, or the absent ones.\n\nNow, what words end with ""RIPS""? \n- TRIPS: but we tried it and T was absent? So not that.\n- BRIPS: B is not excluded? But we haven\'t tested B.\n- GRIPS: G not excluded.\n- DRIPS: D not excluded.\n- FRIPS: F not excluded.\n- PRIPS: P is already in the word? But we are putting P at position 4? But if we put P at position 1? Then it would be PRIPS? But that\'s not a word? Or is it? ""Prips"" is not a standard word.\n\nActually, common words:\n- BRIPS: B R I P S → valid word? Yes, meaning to strike forcefully.\n- GRIPS: G R I P S → same.\n- DRIPS: D R I P S → same.\n- FRIPS: F R I P S → same.\n- WRIPS: W R I P S → same? Not common, but ""wrip"" is a word? But ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, ""wrips"" might be a variant, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAlso, ""CRIPS""? But C is excluded.\n\n""TRIPS"" we tried, ""MIPS"" has M which is excluded? From guess 2: M is absent.\n\nSo, the candidates are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But note, ""WRIPS"" is not a common word? In English, ""wrip"" is a word (meaning to tear or pull), but ""wrips"" is not standard? Actually, I think ""wrips"" is not a valid word. \n\nAlternatively, ""PRIPS""? Not a word.\n\nSo, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, and possibly WRIPS? But I think ""wrips"" is not valid. \n\nTherefore, the secret word must be one of: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, M, T.\n\nSo, B, G, D, F are all allowed.\n\nNow, we have to choose one. But we have only one guess left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so 3 left? But we can solve it.\n\nBut we need to test the first letter.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess one of these to see.\n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess. We can guess ""BRIPS"" for example.\n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""BRIPS"", then:\n- If the secret word is ""BRIPS"", we win.\n- If not, then we get feedback that B is absent? Then we try another.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one unknown letter (position 1) and we know the rest.\n\nBut we don\'t know which of the BRIPS, GRIPS, etc. it is.\n\nSo, we can guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far? And the pattern doesn\'t force duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had P and S present, and in ""trips"" we had P and S correct at positions 4 and 5? And the first letter was T which was absent. So if the secret word were ""BRIPS"", then B is present? But we haven\'t tested B.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""GRIPS"".\n\nBut we can also try to use a word that doesn\'t fix the last four letters? But that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo, let\'s list the possibilities we have: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS, WRIPS? But ""WRIPS"" might be considered a variant of ""wrip"", but I think it\'s not standard? Actually, ""wrip"" is the base, but ""wips"" is not a word? So we can exclude it.\n\nTherefore, the common words are: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nWe have four possibilities. We can try one.\n\nBut we have three guesses left? Actually, we have used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut we need to choose one. We can start with the most common one? Or try to test.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have any information about B, G, D, F? So we can pick one arbitrarily.\n\nBut we can also consider that in the first guess, we had no information about other letters? Actually, we have been testing letters: crane had C,R,A,N,E; prism had P,R,I,S,M; trips had T,R,I,P,S? But note, in ""trips"", we had T at position 1 (absent) and the rest correct.\n\nSo, for the next guess, we can guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it\'s wrong, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.\n\nBut we can also try to use a word that has multiple of the remaining letters? But we don\'t have any other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" or ""FRIPS"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid T? And T is absent, so we can\'t use T.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if B is in the word? We haven\'t tested B? So we can test.\n\nBut we can also note that in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:\n- Position 1: B → if B is correct, then ✓; if absent, then x; if present elsewhere, then \'-\'.\n- Positions 2,3,4,5: R, I, P, S → which should be ✓.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then B would be absent? And we\'d get feedback that B is absent? Then we know it\'s not B, and we try G.\n\nSimilarly, if we get B absent, then we try another.\n\nBut we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut we might as well try a word that tests multiple, but we don\'t have a word that includes B, G, D, F? Because we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"".\n\nBut to be efficient, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests the first letter with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have a word that can test multiple without fixing the last four? Because the last four are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me check: in the feedback for ""prism"", we had S present? But in ""BRIPS"", S is at position 5? And we know S is correct at position 5? So if we guess ""BRIPS"", we expect:\n- B: if the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then ✓; if it\'s ""GRIPS"", then B is absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nWait, if we guess ""BRIPS"", and the secret word is ""GRIPS"", then:\n- B: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓ (if P is at position 4? In ""GRIPS"", P is at position 4? Yes, so P would be ✓.\n- S: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo feedback: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓) → then we know the first letter is not B, so we try G, D, or F.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""GRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:\n- G: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓\n- S: ✓\nSame feedback.\n\nBut if we guess ""DRIPS"" and the secret word is ""BRIPS"", then:\n- D: absent (x)\n- R: ✓\n- I: ✓\n- P: ✓\n- S: ✓\nSame feedback.\n\nSo, we can test one and then proceed.\n\nBut we have three possibilities left? Actually, there might be more? What about ""FRIPS""? Or ""WRIPS""? \n\nLet me list all the common words ending with ""RIPS"" that do not contain T, C, A, N, E, M:\n- BRIPS\n- GRIPS\n- DRIPS\n- FRIPS\n- PRIPS? Not a word.\n- TRIPS? We tried.\n- SRIPS? Not a word.\n\nAlso, ""THRIPS""? Not a word.\n\nSo, four candidates: BRIPS, GRIPS, DRIPS, FRIPS.\n\nWe can try ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make a new guess. We can try ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut we can also note that in the first guess, we had no information about B, G, D, F? So we can test one.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and uses a letter that is common to multiple, but we don\'t have such a word? Because the last four letters are fixed? So we have to test one of the candidates.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me see: we have three guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries total, we used 3, so 3 left? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nBut if we guess ""BRIPS"" and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that B is absent? Then we can try another.\n\nBut we can also consider: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""GRIPS"" and we guess ""BRIPS"", then B is absent? But then we know it\'s not B, and we try G.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests multiple? Because we don\'t know the first letter.\n\nSo, we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""BRIPS"" is a common word? So I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters? And B is not excluded? Yes.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""FRIPS""? Then we get it wrong? But we have more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""GRIPS"" to test G.\n\nBut I think ""BRIPS"" is as good as any.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""BRIPS"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- In the first guess ""crane"", we had no B, G, D, F? So we don\'t know.\n- In the second guess ""prism"", we had P,R,I,S,M → no B, G, D, F? So we don\'t know.\n\nSo, we have to test one.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BRIPS"".\n\n<guess>brips</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  \n  - C, A, N, E absent (x)  \n  - R correct at position 2 (✓)  \n- **Guess 2 (""prism"")**:  \n  - P present but not at position 1 (-)  \n  - R and I correct at positions 2 and 3 (✓)  \n  - S present but not at position 4 (-)  \n  - M absent (x)  \n- **Guess 3 (""trips"")**:  \n  - T absent (x)  \n  - R, I, P, S correct at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (✓)  \n\n### Deductions:\n1.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 confirmed as R, I, P, S).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, M, T, B, G (from feedback).
- **Position 1 constraints**: 
  - Cannot be P (since P is at position 4).
  - Cannot be R, I, S (already placed in positions 2, 3, and 5).
  - Must be a letter not in the absent list.

The only remaining common English words fitting this pattern are **DRIPS** and **FRIPS**. 

### Reasoning:
- **DRIPS**: D is a new letter not excluded by previous feedback.
- **FRIPS**: F is a new letter not excluded.
- Both are valid 5-letter words ending in ""RIPS"".

### Next Guess Strategy:
- We have two candidates left. We can test **DRIPS** to check if D is the first letter.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, then ""FRIPS"" must be the answer (since only two possibilities exist).
