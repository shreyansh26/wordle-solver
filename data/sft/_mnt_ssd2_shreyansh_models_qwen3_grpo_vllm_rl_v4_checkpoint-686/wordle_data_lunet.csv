For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
- Letters in word but wrong place: L, T, E
- Letters NOT in word: S, A

Round 2: TREND → T(-) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)

- E is still in word but not in position 3 or 5
- N is in word but not in position 4
- R and D are NOT in word

So far we know the word must contain:
- L, T, E, N (each exactly once)
- Cannot contain: S, A, R, D

Positions we have constraints on:
- T: cannot be in 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E: cannot be in 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4
- L: cannot be in 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
- N: cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need to arrange L, T, E, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters are: I, C, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Option: T must be in 2, 3, or 5
Option: E must be in 1, 2, or 4
Option: L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
Option: N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Try T in position 2:
- _ T _ _ _
Then E can be 1 or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E T _ _ _
Then L and N must fit in positions 3,4,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (already ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: E T L N _ or E T N L _
But we need one more letter. Let’s pick a common unused letter like I.

Word: E T L N I → ""ELTNI"" – not valid.
Try E T N L I → ""ETNLI"" – not valid.

Try T in position 3:
- _ _ T _ _
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 4:
- _ _ T E _
Then L and N must be in 1,2,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (already ok)
Possible: L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" → ""LTEN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTENX"" – invalid.

Try N in position 1:
- N _ T E _
Then L must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 2), so 5:
- N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""N C T E L"" – ""NCTEL"" – invalid.

Try T in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 2,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4
Possible: E N L _ T or E L N _ T
Need 4th letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""E N L C T"" – ""ENLCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 2:
- _ E _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 1,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: L E N _ T or N E L _ T
""L E N C T"" – ""LENCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 4:
- _ _ _ E T
Then L and N must be in 1,2,3 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (ok)
Possible: L N _ E T or N L _ E T
""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another letter. Let’s try adding I as the 5th letter and rearrange.

Valid word that includes L, T, E, N, I and respects constraints:
- T must be in 2,3,5
- E must be in 1,2,4
- L must not be in 2
- N must not be in 4

Try: T I N E L – ""TINEL"" – invalid.
Try: N E I T L – ""NEITL"" – invalid.

Let’s try a systematic approach. Possible positions for T, E, N, L:

T in 2:
- _ T _ _ _
E in 1: E T _ _ _
  - L and N in 3,4,5 with N not in 4
  - Possible: E T L N _ → need 5th letter. ""ETLNI"" – invalid.
  - E T N L _ → ""ETNLI"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ T _ E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L T N E _ → ""LTNE?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTNEI"" – invalid.
  - N T L E _ → ""NTLE?"" – invalid.

T in 3:
- _ _ T _ _
E in 1: E _ T _ _
  - L and N in 2,4,5 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - L cannot be in 2, so L must be 4 or 5
  - N cannot be in 4, so N must be 2 or 5
  - Possible: N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. ""N I T E L"" – ""NITEL"" – invalid.
  - L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" – need 2nd letter. ""L I T E N"" – ""LITEN"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E T _ _
  - L and N in 1,4,5 with L not in 2 (ok), N not in 4
  - Possible: L E T N _ → ""LETN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LETNI"" – invalid.
  - N E T L _ → ""NETL?"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ T E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N T E _ → ""LNT E?"" – need 5th letter. ""LNT E I"" – ""LNT E I"" – invalid.
  - N L T E _ → ""NLT E?"" – invalid.

T in 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
E in 1: E _ _ _ T
  - L and N in 2,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – ""NLIET"" – invalid.
  - L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E _ _ T
  - L and N in 1,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L E N _ T → ""LEN_T"" – need 4th letter. ""LEN I T"" – ""LENI T"" – invalid.
  - N E L _ T → ""NEL_T"" – need 4th letter. ""NEL I T"" – ""NELI T"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ _ E T
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – invalid.
  - N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another common letter like O or C. Let’s try adding O as the 5th letter.

Try: N O T E L – ""NOTEL"" – invalid.
Try: L O N E T – ""LONET"" – invalid.
Try: O N E T L – ""ONETL"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""OCEAN"" – but A is ruled out.
""CLOTE"" – invalid.
""ELINT"" – valid but uses I.

""ELINT"" – contains E, L, I, N, T
Check constraints:
- E: position 1 (allowed, since E was not in 3 or 5)
- L: position 2 – but L was ruled out from position 2 in SLATE! So ""ELINT"" is invalid because L would be in position 2.

Next valid word: ""TUNEL"" – but U is new, N, E, L, T
But E is in position 2 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (but T was not allowed in 1 from TREND feedback). So T in 1 is invalid.

Next valid word: ""UNTIE"" – but E is in 5 (invalid), and we don’t have U confirmed.

Next valid word: ""INLET"" – I, N, L, E, T
Check positions:
- I: new letter, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed, N not in 4)
- L: position 2 – but L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked (-), so L cannot be in 2. Thus ""INLET"" is invalid.

Next valid word: ""TULLE"" – but L in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next valid word: ""UNTIL"" – U, N, T, I, L
Check:
- U: new, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- T: position 2 (allowed, since T was not in 1 or 4)
- I: new, ok
- L: position 5 (allowed, L was not in 5)

This seems valid. ""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L and respects all constraints.

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
- Letters in word but wrong place: L, T, E
- Letters NOT in word: S, A

Round 2: TREND → T(-) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)
- T is still in word but not in position 1 (confirms it’s not in 1 or 4)
- E is still in word but not in position 3 or 5
- N is in word but not in position 4
- R and D are NOT in word

So far we know the word must contain:
- L, T, E, N (each exactly once)
- Cannot contain: S, A, R, D

Positions we have constraints on:
- T: cannot be in 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E: cannot be in 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4
- L: cannot be in 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
- N: cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need to arrange L, T, E, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters are: I, C, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Option: T must be in 2, 3, or 5
Option: E must be in 1, 2, or 4
Option: L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
Option: N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Try T in position 2:
- _ T _ _ _
Then E can be 1 or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E T _ _ _
Then L and N must fit in positions 3,4,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (already ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: E T L N _ or E T N L _
But we need one more letter. Let’s pick a common unused letter like I.

Word: E T L N I → ""ELTNI"" – not valid.
Try E T N L I → ""ETNLI"" – not valid.

Try T in position 3:
- _ _ T _ _
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 4:
- _ _ T E _
Then L and N must be in 1,2,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (already ok)
Possible: L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" → ""LTEN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTENX"" – invalid.

Try N in position 1:
- N _ T E _
Then L must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 2), so 5:
- N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""N C T E L"" – ""NCTEL"" – invalid.

Try T in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 2,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4
Possible: E N L _ T or E L N _ T
Need 4th letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""E N L C T"" – ""ENLCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 2:
- _ E _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 1,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: L E N _ T or N E L _ T
""L E N C T"" – ""LENCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 4:
- _ _ _ E T
Then L and N must be in 1,2,3 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (ok)
Possible: L N _ E T or N L _ E T
""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another letter. Let’s try adding I as the 5th letter and rearrange.

Valid word that includes L, T, E, N, I and respects constraints:
- T must be in 2,3,5
- E must be in 1,2,4
- L must not be in 2
- N must not be in 4

Try: T I N E L – ""TINEL"" – invalid.
Try: N E I T L – ""NEITL"" – invalid.

Let’s try a systematic approach. Possible positions for T, E, N, L:

T in 2:
- _ T _ _ _
E in 1: E T _ _ _
  - L and N in 3,4,5 with N not in 4
  - Possible: E T L N _ → need 5th letter. ""ETLNI"" – invalid.
  - E T N L _ → ""ETNLI"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ T _ E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L T N E _ → ""LTNE?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTNEI"" – invalid.
  - N T L E _ → ""NTLE?"" – invalid.

T in 3:
- _ _ T _ _
E in 1: E _ T _ _
  - L and N in 2,4,5 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - L cannot be in 2, so L must be 4 or 5
  - N cannot be in 4, so N must be 2 or 5
  - Possible: N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. ""N I T E L"" – ""NITEL"" – invalid.
  - L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" – need 2nd letter. ""L I T E N"" – ""LITEN"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E T _ _
  - L and N in 1,4,5 with L not in 2 (ok), N not in 4
  - Possible: L E T N _ → ""LETN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LETNI"" – invalid.
  - N E T L _ → ""NETL?"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ T E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N T E _ → ""LNT E?"" – need 5th letter. ""LNT E I"" – ""LNT E I"" – invalid.
  - N L T E _ → ""NLT E?"" – invalid.

T in 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
E in 1: E _ _ _ T
  - L and N in 2,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – ""NLIET"" – invalid.
  - L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E _ _ T
  - L and N in 1,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L E N _ T → ""LEN_T"" – need 4th letter. ""LEN I T"" – ""LENI T"" – invalid.
  - N E L _ T → ""NEL_T"" – need 4th letter. ""NEL I T"" – ""NELI T"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ _ E T
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – invalid.
  - N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another common letter like O or C. Let’s try adding O as the 5th letter.

Try: N O T E L – ""NOTEL"" – invalid.
Try: L O N E T – ""LONET"" – invalid.
Try: O N E T L – ""ONETL"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""OCEAN"" – but A is ruled out.
""CLOTE"" – invalid.
""ELINT"" – valid but uses I.

""ELINT"" – contains E, L, I, N, T
Check constraints:
- E: position 1 (allowed, since E was not in 3 or 5)
- L: position 2 – but L was ruled out from position 2 in SLATE! So ""ELINT"" is invalid because L would be in position 2.

Next valid word: ""TUNEL"" – but U is new, N, E, L, T
But E is in position 2 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (but T was not allowed in 1 from TREND feedback). So T in 1 is invalid.

Next valid word: ""UNTIE"" – but E is in 5 (invalid), and we don’t have U confirmed.

Next valid word: ""INLET"" – I, N, L, E, T
Check positions:
- I: new letter, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed, N not in 4)
- L: position 2 – but L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked (-), so L cannot be in 2. Thus ""INLET"" is invalid.

Next valid word: ""TULLE"" – but L in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next valid word: ""UNTIL"" – U, N, T, I, L
Check:
- U: new, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- T: position 2 (allowed, since T was not in 1 or 4)
- I: new, ok
- L: position 5 (allowed, L was not in 5)

This seems valid. ""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L and respects all constraints.",Guess 3: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(-) T(-) I(x) L(-),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: L, T, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A
- Positions to avoid: L not in 2, T not in 4, E not in 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, T, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in SLATE)
2. Does NOT contain S or A
3. Has L not in position 2, T not in position 4, E not in position 5

Let’s try to place these letters in valid positions while filling the remaining two slots with other common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, C, O, etc.).

A promising candidate is ""TREND"":
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T was not in position 4)
- R is new
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E was not in position 5)
- N is new
- D is new

This tests new letters R, N, D while respecting the constraints.

Another valid word: ""OCEAN"" – but A is ruled out.

Next valid word: ""UNTIE"" – but E is in 5 (invalid), and we don’t have U confirmed.

Next valid word: ""INLET"" – I, N, L, E, T
Check positions:
- I: new letter, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed, N not in 4)
- L: position 2 – but L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked (-), so L cannot be in 2. Thus ""INLET"" is invalid.

Next valid word: ""TULLE"" – but L in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next valid word: ""UNTIL"" – U, N, T, I, L
Check:
- U: new, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- T: position 2 (allowed, since T was not in 1 or 4)
- I: new, ok
- L: position 5 (allowed, L was not in 5)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are **in the word** (but we still don’t know their correct positions):

So the secret word contains exactly the letters {L, T, E, N} plus one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.  
The only letters we haven’t tried are among: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: L, T, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, A
- Positions to avoid: L not in 2, T not in 4, E not in 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, T, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in SLATE)
2. Does NOT contain S or A
3. Has L not in position 2, T not in position 4, E not in position 5

Let’s try to place these letters in valid positions while filling the remaining two slots with other common letters not yet tested (like R, N, I, C, O, etc.).

A promising candidate is ""TREND"":
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T was not in position 4)
- R is new
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E was not in position 5)
- N is new
- D is new

This tests new letters R, N, D while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
- Letters in word but wrong place: L, T, E
- Letters NOT in word: S, A

Round 2: TREND → T(-) R(x) E(-) N(-) D(x)
- T is still in word but not in position 1 (confirms it’s not in 1 or 4)
- E is still in word but not in position 3 or 5
- N is in word but not in position 4
- R and D are NOT in word

So far we know the word must contain:
- L, T, E, N (each exactly once)
- Cannot contain: S, A, R, D

Positions we have constraints on:
- T: cannot be in 1 or 4 → possible positions: 2, 3, 5
- E: cannot be in 3 or 5 → possible positions: 1, 2, 4
- L: cannot be in 2 → possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5
- N: cannot be in 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need to arrange L, T, E, N plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters are: I, C, O, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

Option: T must be in 2, 3, or 5
Option: E must be in 1, 2, or 4
Option: L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
Option: N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5

Try T in position 2:
- _ T _ _ _
Then E can be 1 or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E T _ _ _
Then L and N must fit in positions 3,4,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (already ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: E T L N _ or E T N L _
But we need one more letter. Let’s pick a common unused letter like I.

Word: E T L N I → ""ELTNI"" – not valid.
Try E T N L I → ""ETNLI"" – not valid.

Try T in position 3:
- _ _ T _ _
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 4:
- _ _ T E _
Then L and N must be in 1,2,5 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (already ok)
Possible: L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" → ""LTEN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTENX"" – invalid.

Try N in position 1:
- N _ T E _
Then L must be in 2 or 5 (cannot be in 2), so 5:
- N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""N C T E L"" – ""NCTEL"" – invalid.

Try T in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
Then E can be 1, 2, or 4
Try E in position 1:
- E _ _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 2,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4
Possible: E N L _ T or E L N _ T
Need 4th letter. Common unused: C, O, I, etc.
""E N L C T"" – ""ENLCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 2:
- _ E _ _ T
Then L and N must be in 1,3,4 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: L E N _ T or N E L _ T
""L E N C T"" – ""LENCT"" – invalid.

Try E in position 4:

Then L and N must be in 1,2,3 with constraints:
L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (ok)
Possible: L N _ E T or N L _ E T
""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another letter. Let’s try adding I as the 5th letter and rearrange.

Valid word that includes L, T, E, N, I and respects constraints:
- T must be in 2,3,5
- E must be in 1,2,4
- L must not be in 2
- N must not be in 4

Try: T I N E L – ""TINEL"" – invalid.
Try: N E I T L – ""NEITL"" – invalid.

Let’s try a systematic approach. Possible positions for T, E, N, L:

T in 2:
- _ T _ _ _
E in 1: E T _ _ _
  - L and N in 3,4,5 with N not in 4
  - Possible: E T L N _ → need 5th letter. ""ETLNI"" – invalid.
  - E T N L _ → ""ETNLI"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ T _ E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L T N E _ → ""LTNE?"" – need 5th letter. ""LTNEI"" – invalid.
  - N T L E _ → ""NTLE?"" – invalid.

T in 3:
- _ _ T _ _
E in 1: E _ T _ _
  - L and N in 2,4,5 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - L cannot be in 2, so L must be 4 or 5
  - N cannot be in 4, so N must be 2 or 5
  - Possible: N _ T E L → ""N_TEL"" – need 2nd letter. ""N I T E L"" – ""NITEL"" – invalid.
  - L _ T E N → ""L_TEN"" – need 2nd letter. ""L I T E N"" – ""LITEN"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E T _ _
  - L and N in 1,4,5 with L not in 2 (ok), N not in 4
  - Possible: L E T N _ → ""LETN?"" – need 5th letter. ""LETNI"" – invalid.
  - N E T L _ → ""NETL?"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ T E _
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N T E _ → ""LNT E?"" – need 5th letter. ""LNT E I"" – ""LNT E I"" – invalid.
  - N L T E _ → ""NLT E?"" – invalid.

T in 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
E in 1: E _ _ _ T
  - L and N in 2,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – ""NLIET"" – invalid.
  - L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – ""LNIET"" – invalid.

E in 2: _ E _ _ T
  - L and N in 1,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L E N _ T → ""LEN_T"" – need 4th letter. ""LEN I T"" – ""LENI T"" – invalid.
  - N E L _ T → ""NEL_T"" – need 4th letter. ""NEL I T"" – ""NELI T"" – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ _ E T
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N _ E T → ""L N _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""L N I E T"" – invalid.
  - N L _ E T → ""N L _ E T"" – need 3rd letter. ""N L I E T"" – invalid.

Seems like we need to include another common letter like O or C. Let’s try adding O as the 5th letter.

Try: N O T E L – ""NOTEL"" – invalid.
Try: L O N E T – ""LONET"" – invalid.
Try: O N E T L – ""ONETL"" – invalid.

Another valid word: ""OCEAN"" – but A is ruled out.
""CLOTE"" – invalid.
""ELINT"" – valid but uses I.

""ELINT"" – contains E, L, I, N, T
Check constraints:
- E: position 1 (allowed, since E was not in 3 or 5)
- L: position 2 – but L was ruled out from position 2 in SLATE! So ""ELINT"" is invalid because L would be in position 2.

Next valid word: ""TUNEL"" – but U is new, N, E, L, T
But E is in position 2 (allowed), L in 4 (allowed), T in 1 (but T was not allowed in 1 from TREND feedback). So T in 1 is invalid.

Next valid word: ""UNTIE"" – but E is in 5 (invalid), and we don’t have U confirmed.

Next valid word: ""INLET"" – I, N, L, E, T
Check positions:
- I: new letter, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed, N not in 4)
- L: position 2 – but L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked (-), so L cannot be in 2. Thus ""INLET"" is invalid.

Next valid word: ""TULLE"" – but L in 3 (allowed), T in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next valid word: ""UNTIL"" – U, N, T, I, L
Check:
- U: new, ok
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- T: position 2 (allowed, since T was not in 1 or 4)
- I: new, ok
- L: position 5 (allowed, L was not in 5)

This seems valid. ""UNTIL"" uses U, N, T, I, L and respects all constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are **in the word** (but we still don’t know their correct positions):
- L (from SLATE and UNTIL: never in position 2, 5)
- T (from SLATE and TREND and UNTIL: never in position 1, 4, 3)
- E (from SLATE and TREND: never in position 3, 5)
- N (from TREND and UNTIL: never in position 4)

Letters that are **not in the word**:
- S, A, R, D, I

So the secret word contains exactly the letters {L, T, E, N} plus one more letter that hasn’t been used yet.  
The only letters we haven’t tried are among: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- T must be in position 2 or 5 (it cannot be 1,3,4)
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3,5)
- L must be in position 1,3,4 (cannot be 2,5)
- N must be in position 1,2,3,5 (cannot be 4)

We need to place L, T, E, N plus one new letter in a valid arrangement.

Let’s try T in position 2:
- _ T _ _ _
Then E can be 1 or 4
Try E in 1:
- E T _ _ _
Now L and N must go in 3,4,5 with constraints:
- L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: E T L N _ → need 5th letter. “ETLNX” – invalid.
Try adding a new letter O: E T L N O – “ETLNO” – invalid.

Try E in 4:
- _ T _ E _
Now L and N must go in 1,3,5 with constraints:
- L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4 (ok)
Possible: L T N E _ → “LTNE?” – need 5th letter. “LTNEW” – invalid.
Or N T L E _ → “NTLE?” – invalid.

Try T in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
Then E can be 1,2,4
Try E in 1:
- E _ _ _ T
Now L and N must be in 2,3,4 with constraints:
- L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4
Possible: N L _ E T → “NL_E T” – need 3rd letter. “NLIET” – invalid.
Or L N _ E T → “LN_E T” – need 3rd letter. “LNIET” – invalid.

Try E in 2:
- _ E _ _ T
Now L and N must be in 1,3,4 with constraints:
- L cannot be in 2 (ok), N cannot be in 4
Possible: L E N _ T → “LEN_T” – need 4th letter. “LENI T” – invalid.
Or N E L _ T → “NEL_T” – need 4th letter. “NELI T” – invalid.

Try E in 4:
- _ _ _ E T
Now L and N must be in 1,2,3 with constraints:
- L cannot be in 2, N cannot be in 4 (ok)
Possible: L N _ E T → “L N _ E T” – need 3rd letter. “L N O E T” – “LNOET” – invalid.
Or N L _ E T → “N L _ E T” – need 3rd letter. “N L O E T” – “NLOET” – invalid.

We’re missing a valid word. Let’s try T in position 2 again and add a different new letter.

Try: N E T L _ – but E is in 2 (allowed), T in 3 (invalid, T cannot be 3).

Wait, T can only be 2 or 5.

Let’s try T in position 2 and add C as new letter:
- _ T _ _ _
E in 1: E T _ _ _
  - L and N in 3,4,5 with N not in 4
  - E T L N C – “ETLNC” – invalid.

E in 4: _ T _ E _
  - L and N in 1,3,5 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L T N E C – “LTNE C” – invalid.

Try T in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ T
E in 1: E _ _ _ T
  - L and N in 2,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: N L _ E T – “NL_E T” – need 3rd letter. “NLIET” – invalid.
  - L N _ E T – “LN_E T” – need 3rd letter. “LNIET” – invalid.

E in 2: _ E _ _ T
  - L and N in 1,3,4 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L E N _ T – “LEN_T” – need 4th letter. “LENI T” – invalid.
  - N E L _ T – “NEL_T” – need 4th letter. “NELI T” – invalid.

E in 4: _ _ _ E T
  - L and N in 1,2,3 with L not in 2, N not in 4
  - Possible: L N _ E T – “L N _ E T” – need 3rd letter. “L N O E T” – invalid.
  - N L _ E T – “N L _ E T” – need 3rd letter. “N L O E T” – invalid.

Let’s try a different new letter: O.

Try: O N E T L – “ONETL” – invalid.
Try: O T E L N – “OTELN” – invalid.
Try: L O N E T – “LONET” – invalid.

Another valid word: “OCEAN” – but A is out.
“LOFTY” – but F and Y are new, and we need N and E.

Wait, we must include N and E.

Valid word: “NEON” – too short.
“OFTEN” – contains O, F, E, N, T
Check constraints:
- O: new, ok
- F: new, ok
- E: position 4 (allowed, E not in 3,5)
- N: position 3 (allowed, N not in 4)
- T: position 5 (allowed, T not in 1,3,4)

This fits all constraints!

From Guess 4 (OFTEN) we now know:

- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word AND in the correct position: position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- O and F are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern:

_ _ _ E _

and must contain the letters {T, N} plus one more letter that hasn’t appeared yet (and can’t be S, A, R, D, I, O, F).

We also have positional constraints:
- T cannot be in 1, 3, 4 (from earlier) and now cannot be in 3 again → T must be in 2 or 5.
- N cannot be in 4 or 5 → N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- L is still in the word but cannot be in 2, 5 (from SLATE and UNTIL) → L must be in 1 or 3.
- We still need one more letter, which must be a new letter not yet used (not S, A, R, D, I, O, F). Possible new letters: B, C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible positions:

Valid English word: N T L E ? – “N T L E ?” – nothing obvious.

Subcase 1.2: N in 3, L in 1
Word: L _ N E T – but T is in 2, so “L T N E _” – invalid (T already in 2).

Case 2: T in position 5

Then N must be in 1, 2, or 3.
L must be in 1 or 3.

Subcase 2.1: N in 1, L in 3

We’re not finding a valid English word. Let’s try a different approach: list all 5-letter English words that contain exactly {L, T, E, N} plus one new letter, with E in position 4.

Possible words:
- N E T L ? – but E is 4, so N E T L _ – invalid.
- T E N L ? – but T must be 2 or 5, E 4, N must be 1,2,3, L 1 or 3.
- L E N T ? – but T must be 2 or 5, E 4, N must be 1,2,3, L 1 or 3.
- E N T L ? – E is 1, not 4.

Let’s try “ELINT” – but E is 1, not 4.
“INLET” – E is 4, but L is 2 (invalid).
“UNTIE” – but U is new, N, T, I, E – but I is out.

Let’s try “UNTIE” – but I is out.

Let’s try “YOUTH” – but O, U, T, H, Y – but we need N and E.

We must include N and E. Let’s try “NEBEL” – but B is new, N, E, B, E, L – but E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “BENTH” – but H is new, B, E, N, T, H – E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “PENET” – but P is new, E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “LENTE” – but E is 5, not 4.

Let’s try “TENET” – but T is 1 (invalid), E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “NETEL” – but E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “LUNET” – but U is new, L, U, N, E, T – E is 4, T is 5 (valid), N is 3 (valid), L is 1 (valid), U is new. This seems valid.

“LUNET” is a valid English word (a type of net used in fishing). It contains:
- L (must be in 1 or 3) – here 1 (ok)
- U (new letter)
- N (must be 1,2,3) – here 3 (ok)
- E (must be 4) – here 4 (ok)
- T (must be 2 or 5) – here 5 (ok)

This fits all constraints!

- We still need one more letter, which must be a new letter not yet used (not S, A, R, D, I, O, F). Possible new letters: B, C, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible positions:

We’re not finding a valid English word. Let’s try a different approach: list all 5-letter English words that contain exactly {L, T, E, N} plus one new letter, with E in position 4.

Possible words:
- N E T L ? – but E is 4, so N E T L _ – invalid.
- T E N L ? – but T must be 2 or 5, E 4, N must be 1,2,3, L 1 or 3.
- L E N T ? – but T must be 2 or 5, E 4, N must be 1,2,3, L 1 or 3.
- E N T L ? – E is 1, not 4.

Let’s try “ELINT” – but E is 1, not 4.
“INLET” – E is 4, but L is 2 (invalid).
“UNTIE” – but U is new, N, T, I, E – but I is out.

Let’s try “UNTIE” – but I is out.

Let’s try “YOUTH” – but O, U, T, H, Y – but we need N and E.

We must include N and E. Let’s try “NEBEL” – but B is new, N, E, B, E, L – but E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “BENTH” – but H is new, B, E, N, T, H – E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “PENET” – but P is new, E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “LENTE” – but E is 5, not 4.

Let’s try “TENET” – but T is 1 (invalid), E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “NETEL” – but E is 2, not 4.

Let’s try “LUNET” – but U is new, L, U, N, E, T – E is 4, T is 5 (valid), N is 3 (valid), L is 1 (valid), U is new. This seems valid.

“LUNET” is a valid English word (a type of net used in fishing). It contains:
- L (must be in 1 or 3) – here 1 (ok)
- U (new letter)
- N (must be 1,2,3) – here 3 (ok)
- E (must be 4) – here 4 (ok)
- T (must be 2 or 5) – here 5 (ok)

This fits all constraints!
