- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.

- The word ends in E.
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

A good next step is to test new consonants while placing R and O in different positions. The word “ROGER” comes to mind because:
- It keeps E in position 5 (confirmed).
- It moves R to position 1 and O to position 2, testing new positions.
- It introduces G (another common consonant) and keeps R in the word.

This should help determine whether R or O are in their correct spots or if they need to move further.

Let's consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - A, S are out.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. ROGER → R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it's not in position 2).
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - G is out.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already know it's in position 5).

So far:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is E.
- Letters in word: R, O, E.
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 5 is E).
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 5.
- R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are excluded for R).
- No A, S, G.

Possible pattern: _ O _ _ _ with R in position 3 or 4, and ending in E.

Let's think of words fitting this:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ E
  - Possible: ""CORNE"" (but N is allowed), ""FORGE"" (but G is out), ""BROKE"" (B is allowed), ""DROVE"" (D is allowed), ""TROPE"" (T is allowed).
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R E
  - Possible: ""FOREX"" (but X is allowed), ""MOORE"" (but double O is possible), ""POKER"" (but ends in R, not E).

Looking at these, ""BROKE"" seems good:
- B is a new consonant to test.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- K is a new consonant.
- E is in position 5 (fixed).

This tests B, K and confirms R in position 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

A good next step is to test new consonants while placing R and O in different positions. The word “ROGER” comes to mind because:
- It keeps E in position 5 (confirmed).
- It moves R to position 1 and O to position 2, testing new positions.
- It introduces G (another common consonant) and keeps R in the word.

This should help determine whether R or O are in their correct spots or if they need to move further.

Let's consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - A, S are out.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. ROGER → R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it's not in position 2).
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - G is out.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already know it's in position 5).

So far:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is E.
- Letters in word: R, O, E.
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 5 is E).
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 5.
- R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are excluded for R).
- No A, S, G.

Possible pattern: _ O _ _ _ with R in position 3 or 4, and ending in E.

Let's think of words fitting this:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ E
  - Possible: ""CORNE"" (but N is allowed), ""FORGE"" (but G is out), ""BROKE"" (B is allowed), ""DROVE"" (D is allowed), ""TROPE"" (T is allowed).
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R E
  - Possible: ""FOREX"" (but X is allowed), ""MOORE"" (but double O is possible), ""POKER"" (but ends in R, not E).

Looking at these, ""BROKE"" seems good:
- B is a new consonant to test.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- K is a new consonant.
- E is in position 5 (fixed).

This tests B, K and confirms R in position 3.

From the feedback so far we have:

- Position 2 = O (✓ from every guess)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from every guess)
- Position 4 = R (✓ from HORDE)
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

So the pattern is now: _ O _ R E

We need a letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out.  
Available consonants (not yet excluded): C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- C O R E → needs 5 letters → CORER (but R repeats, and we already have R in position 4)
- F O R E → FORGE (G is out)
- L O R E → needs 5 letters → LORER (R repeats)
- M O R E → MORER (R repeats)
- N O R E → needs 5 letters → NOPER (but P is allowed, but NOPER doesn’t fit _ O _ R E)
- T O R E → TORER (R repeats)
- F O R E → FORER (but R repeats)
- C O R E → CORER (R repeats)

Wait, we need a single letter for position 1 such that the word is _ O _ R E.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in ORE with R in position 4:
- CORER (C is allowed, R repeats – but allowed)
- FORER (F is allowed, but R repeats)
- LORER (L is allowed, R repeats)
- MORER (M is allowed, R repeats)
- TORER (T is allowed, R repeats)

But we have no evidence that R repeats. Let’s try a word with distinct letters.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ R E, and we have no info about position 3 yet. From BROKE, O was in position 3 and got (-), but that was before we fixed O in position 2. So O can only be in position 2.

So the word is: [consonant] O [consonant] R E

Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

Possible consonants for position 1: C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible consonants for position 3: same list, excluding those already used or ruled out.

Let’s list possible words:
- C O C R E → COCR E (invalid)
- C O F R E → COFRE (not a word)
- C O L R E → COLRE (invalid)
- C O M R E → COMRE (invalid)
- C O N R E → CONRE (invalid)
- C O P R E → COPRE (invalid)
- C O T R E → COTRE (invalid)
- C O W R E → COWRE (invalid)
- F O C R E → FOCRE (invalid)
- F O L R E → FOLRE (invalid)
- F O M R E → FOMRE (invalid)
- F O N R E → FONRE (invalid)
- L O C R E → LOCER (but C is allowed, E is fixed)
- L O F R E → LOFRE (invalid)
- L O M R E → LOMRE (invalid)
- L O N R E → LONER (valid word!)

LONER fits:
- L (position 1) – not ruled out
- O (position 2) – fixed
- N (position 3) – not ruled out
- R (position 4) – fixed
- E (position 5) – fixed

No banned letters, and no repeats of letters we know are in the word (except R, which is already confirmed).

So LONER seems like the best next guess.

- Position 2 = O (✓ from every guess)
- Position 5 = E (✓ from every guess)
- Position 4 = R (✓ from HORDE)
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

So the pattern is now: _ O _ R E

We need a letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out.  
Available consonants (not yet excluded): C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- C O R E → needs 5 letters → CORER (but R repeats, and we already have R in position 4)
- F O R E → FORGE (G is out)
- L O R E → needs 5 letters → LORER (R repeats)
- M O R E → MORER (R repeats)
- N O R E → needs 5 letters → NOPER (but P is allowed, but NOPER doesn’t fit _ O _ R E)
- T O R E → TORER (R repeats)
- F O R E → FORER (but R repeats)
- C O R E → CORER (R repeats)

Wait, we need a single letter for position 1 such that the word is _ O _ R E.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in ORE with R in position 4:
- CORER (C is allowed, R repeats – but allowed)
- FORER (F is allowed, but R repeats)
- LORER (L is allowed, R repeats)
- MORER (M is allowed, R repeats)
- TORER (T is allowed, R repeats)

But we have no evidence that R repeats. Let’s try a word with distinct letters.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ R E, and we have no info about position 3 yet. From BROKE, O was in position 3 and got (-), but that was before we fixed O in position 2. So O can only be in position 2.

So the word is: [consonant] O [consonant] R E

Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

Possible consonants for position 1: C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible consonants for position 3: same list, excluding those already used or ruled out.

Let’s list possible words:
- C O C R E → COCR E (invalid)
- C O F R E → COFRE (not a word)
- C O L R E → COLRE (invalid)
- C O M R E → COMRE (invalid)
- C O N R E → CONRE (invalid)
- C O P R E → COPRE (invalid)
- C O T R E → COTRE (invalid)
- C O W R E → COWRE (invalid)
- F O C R E → FOCRE (invalid)
- F O L R E → FOLRE (invalid)
- F O M R E → FOMRE (invalid)
- F O N R E → FONRE (invalid)
- L O C R E → LOCER (but C is allowed, E is fixed)
- L O F R E → LOFRE (invalid)
- L O M R E → LOMRE (invalid)
- L O N R E → LONER (valid word!)

LONER fits:
- L (position 1) – not ruled out
- O (position 2) – fixed
- N (position 3) – not ruled out
- R (position 4) – fixed
- E (position 5) – fixed

No banned letters, and no repeats of letters we know are in the word (except R, which is already confirmed).

So LONER seems like the best next guess.",Guess 5: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) R(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering common letters in English. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S) 
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good baseline to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and is in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains R and O, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

A good next step is to test new consonants while placing R and O in different positions. The word “ROGER” comes to mind because:
- It keeps E in position 5 (confirmed).
- It moves R to position 1 and O to position 2, testing new positions.
- It introduces G (another common consonant) and keeps R in the word.

This should help determine whether R or O are in their correct spots or if they need to move further.

Let's consolidate what we now know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - A, S are out.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. ROGER → R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it's not in position 2).
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - G is out.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (we already know it's in position 5).

So far:
- Position 2 is O.
- Position 5 is E.
- Letters in word: R, O, E.
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since position 5 is E).
- O is fixed in position 2.
- E is fixed in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 5.
- R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since 1,2,5 are excluded for R).
- No A, S, G.

Possible pattern: _ O _ _ _ with R in position 3 or 4, and ending in E.

Let's think of words fitting this:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ E
  - Possible: ""CORNE"" (but N is allowed), ""FORGE"" (but G is out), ""BROKE"" (B is allowed), ""DROVE"" (D is allowed), ""TROPE"" (T is allowed).
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R E
  - Possible: ""FOREX"" (but X is allowed), ""MOORE"" (but double O is possible), ""POKER"" (but ends in R, not E).

Looking at these, ""BROKE"" seems good:
- B is a new consonant to test.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- K is a new consonant.
- E is in position 5 (fixed).

This tests B, K and confirms R in position 3.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - A, S are out.
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5.

2. ROGER → R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(-) R(-)
   - O is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already known to be in 5).
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5.
   - G is out.

3. BROKE → B(x) R(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)
   - B and K are out.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Current constraints:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = E
- R must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be in 1,2,5).
- From BROKE feedback, R is NOT in position 3 (because the feedback for R in BROKE was (-)), so R must be in position 4.
- Therefore, word pattern: _ O _ R E
- Letters used so far: O, R, E
- Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K
- Remaining possible consonants for position 1: C, D, F, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words fitting _ O _ R E:
- CORER (but R is already in position 4, so this would have R twice – allowed, but let’s check if R can repeat)
- DORER (same issue)
- FORGE (G is out)
- HORSE (S is out)
- MORSE (S is out)
- TORSE (S is out)
- FRORE (F is allowed, but R would repeat)
- HORDE (H is allowed, no repeats)
- FORGE (G out)
- HORDE: H O R D E – fits all constraints: O in 2, R in 4, E in 5, no banned letters.

Let’s try HORDE.

- Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

So the pattern is now: _ O _ R E

We need a letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out.  
Available consonants (not yet excluded): C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- C O R E → needs 5 letters → CORER (but R repeats, and we already have R in position 4)
- F O R E → FORGE (G is out)
- L O R E → needs 5 letters → LORER (R repeats)
- M O R E → MORER (R repeats)
- N O R E → needs 5 letters → NOPER (but P is allowed, but NOPER doesn’t fit _ O _ R E)
- T O R E → TORER (R repeats)
- F O R E → FORER (but R repeats)
- C O R E → CORER (R repeats)

Wait, we need a single letter for position 1 such that the word is _ O _ R E.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in ORE with R in position 4:
- CORER (C is allowed, R repeats – but allowed)
- FORER (F is allowed, but R repeats)
- LORER (L is allowed, R repeats)
- MORER (M is allowed, R repeats)
- TORER (T is allowed, R repeats)

But we have no evidence that R repeats. Let’s try a word with distinct letters.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ R E, and we have no info about position 3 yet. From BROKE, O was in position 3 and got (-), but that was before we fixed O in position 2. So O can only be in position 2.

So the word is: [consonant] O [consonant] R E

Letters ruled out: A, S, G, B, K, H, D

Possible consonants for position 1: C, F, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible consonants for position 3: same list, excluding those already used or ruled out.

Let’s list possible words:
- C O C R E → COCR E (invalid)
- C O F R E → COFRE (not a word)
- C O L R E → COLRE (invalid)
- C O M R E → COMRE (invalid)
- C O N R E → CONRE (invalid)
- C O P R E → COPRE (invalid)
- C O T R E → COTRE (invalid)
- C O W R E → COWRE (invalid)
- F O C R E → FOCRE (invalid)
- F O L R E → FOLRE (invalid)
- F O M R E → FOMRE (invalid)
- F O N R E → FONRE (invalid)
- L O C R E → LOCER (but C is allowed, E is fixed)
- L O F R E → LOFRE (invalid)
- L O M R E → LOMRE (invalid)
- L O N R E → LONER (valid word!)

LONER fits:
- L (position 1) – not ruled out
- O (position 2) – fixed
- N (position 3) – not ruled out
- R (position 4) – fixed
- E (position 5) – fixed

No banned letters, and no repeats of letters we know are in the word (except R, which is already confirmed).

So LONER seems like the best next guess.

Let's extract every constraint we have so far.

Known positions (✓):
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = R
- Position 5 = E

So the pattern is: _ O _ R E

A, S, G, B, K, H, D, L, N

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3:
C, F, M, P, T, W, Y, plus any others not yet excluded.

From the feedback on LONER:
- L(x) – L is out.
- O(✓) – already known.
- N(x) – N is out.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already know it’s in 5).
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already know it’s in 4).

So we still have _ O _ R E, and the only open positions are 1 and 3.

We need two different letters (or possibly the same letter twice if repetition is allowed) from the remaining set.

Possible consonants for position 1: C, F, M, P, T, W, Y  
Possible consonants for position 3: same set.

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words fitting _ O _ R E with only allowed letters:

- C O C R E → “COCRE” – not a word  
- C O F R E → “COFRE” – not a word  
- C O M R E → “COMRE” – not a word  
- C O P R E → “COPRE” – not a word  
- C O T R E → “COTRE” – not a word  
- C O W R E → “COWRE” – not a word  

- F O C R E → “FOCRE” – not a word  
- F O M R E → “FOMRE” – not a word  
- F O P R E → “FOPRE” – not a word  
- F O T R E → “FOTRE” – not a word  

- M O C R E → “MOCRE” – not a word  
- M O F R E → “MOFRE” – not a word  
- M O P R E → “MOPRE” – not a word  
- M O T R E → “MOTRE” – not a word  

- P O C R E → “POCRE” – not a word  
- P O F R E → “POFRE” – not a word  
- P O M R E → “POMRE” – not a word  
- P O T R E → “POTRE” – not a word  

- T O C R E → “TOCRE” – not a word  
- T O F R E → “TOFRE” – not a word  
- T O M R E → “TOMRE” – not a word  
- T O P R E → “TOPRE” – not a word  

- W O C R E → “WOCRE” – not a word  
- W O F R E → “WOFRE” – not a word  
- W O M R E → “WOMRE” – not a word  
- W O P R E → “WOPRE” – not a word  

- Y O C R E → “YOCRE” – not a word  
- Y O F R E → “YOFRE” – not a word  
- Y O M R E → “YOMRE” – not a word  
- Y O P R E → “YOPRE” – not a word  

None of these are valid English words. This suggests that either:
1. We need to consider letter repetition (even though we haven’t seen evidence for it yet), or
2. We might have missed a valid word.

Let me reconsider: perhaps the word uses the same letter twice in positions 1 and 3.

Looking for _ O _ R E with letters from {C, F, M, P, T, W, Y}:

- C O C R E → “COCRE” – not valid  
- C O T R E → “COTRE” – not valid  
- T O C R E → “TOCRE” – not valid  

- P O W R E → “POWER” – but W is allowed, and P, W not yet excluded.  
  Pattern: P O W R E – but position 3 must be W, which is allowed.

“POWER” is a valid English word. Let’s check constraints:
- P (position 1) – not ruled out  
- O (position 2) – correct  
- W (position 3) – not ruled out  
- R (position 4) – correct  
- E (position 5) – correct  

No banned letters, and no repeats of letters we have ruled out.

Therefore, POWER is the logical next guess.

<guess>POWER</guess>",POWER,"Let's extract every constraint we have so far.

Known positions (✓):
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = R
- Position 5 = E

So the pattern is: _ O _ R E

Letters that have been ruled out (x in any position):
A, S, G, B, K, H, D, L, N

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3:
C, F, M, P, T, W, Y, plus any others not yet excluded.

From the feedback on LONER:
- L(x) – L is out.
- O(✓) – already known.
- N(x) – N is out.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already know it’s in 5).
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already know it’s in 4).

So we still have _ O _ R E, and the only open positions are 1 and 3.
