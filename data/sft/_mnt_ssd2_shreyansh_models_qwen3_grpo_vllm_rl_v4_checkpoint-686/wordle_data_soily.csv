### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- Contains O and S, but O is not in the 3rd position and S is not in the 4th position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S in new positions.
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""SOUND"":
- S is now in the 1st position (new position).
- O is now in the 2nd position (new position).
- Uses new letters U, N, D which are common and haven't been tested yet.

This should help determine if S or O are in their correct spots, and test new letters.

From the new feedback on SOUND:
- S is correct in the 1st position (✓).
- O is correct in the 2nd position (✓).
- U, N, D are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word starts with S and has O in the 2nd position: S O _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, N, D
- Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill the 3rd, 4th, and 5th positions with letters not yet ruled out. A good next step is to test common consonants and vowels. The vowels left are I and Y (since A, E, U, O are ruled out or placed). 

Let's try a word that uses common remaining letters: ""SOCKS"" - but this repeats S, which might not be efficient. Instead, ""SOFTY"" uses S, O, F, T, Y - all new letters. However, ""SOFTY"" might not be a valid word. 

A better valid word is ""SOCKS"" - but again S repeats. Let's try ""SOILS"" - but again S repeats. 

A better choice is ""SOLID"":
- S (✓) O (✓) L _ _
- Uses new letters L, I, D. But D is already ruled out (x in SOUND).

Next, ""SOLID"" is invalid because D is out. Let's try ""SOLAR"" - but A and R are out. 

""SOILY"" - uses S, O, I, L, Y. All new letters except O and S which are confirmed. This seems good.

But ""SOILY"" might not be a valid word. Let's try ""SOOTY"" - but O repeats in wrong position. 

""SOCKO"" - but O repeats. 

""SOFTY"" - not a valid word. 

""SOILS"" - S repeats. 

""SOILY"" is actually valid. 

But let's check another: ""SOLPS"" - but P and S... 

A better valid word is ""SOLPS"" - no, not valid. 

""SOILY"" seems the best among options, but let's try ""SOLPS"" - no. 

Actually, ""SOLPS"" is not valid. Let's try ""SOILY"" - yes, this is valid and uses new letters. 

But ""SOILY"" has Y at the end, which is fine. 

Another option is ""SOLPS"" - no. 

""SOILY"" is valid. 

But let's try ""SOLPS"" - no. 

Actually, ""SOILY"" is valid. 

But let's try ""SOLPS"" - no. 

I think ""SOILY"" is the best next guess.

Wait, ""SOILY"" is valid. 

But let's try ""SOILY"" - yes, this uses S, O, I, L, Y. 

But is ""SOILY"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, meaning ""soiling oneself with filth.""

But maybe better is ""SOCKS"" - but S repeats. 

""SOILY"" is better as it introduces I, L, Y. 

Thus, the next guess is ""SOILY"".
