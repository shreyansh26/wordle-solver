### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that places S and E in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
""STILE"" uses S, T, I, L, E – none of A, R, O appear.  
Positions: S in 1, E in 5 – but E was originally in 5 (AROSE) and marked wrong position, so E cannot be in 5 again.  
Thus STILE is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SELFS"" – but repeats S and uses F, L.  
Positions: S in 1, E in 2 – both new positions.  
No A, R, O.  
This looks valid.

Another candidate: ""SLEEP"" – but contains E in 5 (invalid).  
""SLICE"" – E in 4, S in 1 – valid.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E  
Exact positions so far:
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (because it got “-” in both AROSE and STEIN).

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ E _ _  
and the remaining letters we can still use are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known S.

We need to place S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are excluded for S).  
Let’s try a word that keeps E in slot 3 and puts S in slot 2 or 5, while using only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- SHEDS – but D and H are allowed, yet S repeats and we don’t know if repeats are allowed.
- GUESS – uses G, U, S, S; repeats S, but S could appear twice.
- LENSE – but N is already excluded.
- WELSH – W, E, L, S, H; all letters are allowed and no repeats.  
  Pattern: W E L S H → E is in 3, S is in 4, but we know S cannot be in 4.  
- BESOM – B, E, S, O, M; O is excluded.
- FLESH – F, L, E, S, H; E in 3, S in 4 (invalid again).
- DRESS – R is excluded.
- PESKY – P, E, S, K, Y; E in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

Looking at single-S placements:
- _ S E _ _ : e.g., HUSLE (H, U, S, L, E) – but E must be in 3, so H U S E _ doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E S _ : e.g., C L E S S – repeats S.

- _ _ E _ _ with S in 2: e.g., B E S E S – repeats E/S.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E  
Exact positions so far:
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (because it got “-” in both AROSE and STEIN).

So the pattern so far looks like: _ _ E _ _  
and the remaining letters we can still use are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known S.

We need to place S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are excluded for S).  
Let’s try a word that keeps E in slot 3 and puts S in slot 2 or 5, while using only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- SHEDS – but D and H are allowed, yet S repeats and we don’t know if repeats are allowed.
- GUESS – uses G, U, S, S; repeats S, but S could appear twice.
- LENSE – but N is already excluded.
- WELSH – W, E, L, S, H; all letters are allowed and no repeats.  
  Pattern: W E L S H → E is in 3, S is in 4, but we know S cannot be in 4.  
- BESOM – B, E, S, O, M; O is excluded.
- FLESH – F, L, E, S, H; E in 3, S in 4 (invalid again).
- DRESS – R is excluded.
- PESKY – P, E, S, K, Y; E in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

Looking at single-S placements:
- _ S E _ _ : e.g., HUSLE (H, U, S, L, E) – but E must be in 3, so H U S E _ doesn’t fit.
- _ _ E S _ : e.g., C L E S S – repeats S.
- _ _ E _ S : e.g., C H E S S – repeats S.
- _ _ E _ _ with S in 2: e.g., B E S E S – repeats E/S.
- _ _ E _ _ with S in 5: e.g., C H E E S – repeats E/S.

A clean single-S placement is _ _ E _ S.  
Let’s pick a word with S in 5:  
CHEPS – C, H, E, P, S; all letters allowed, E in 3, S in 5, no repeats.

Thus, CHEPS is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions:

  – H in position 2
  – E in position 3
  – S in position 5

- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, P

- Position 4 is still unknown; we need a letter that has not been ruled out.

Allowed letters left (excluding the already-eliminated ones): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a single letter for position 4 that forms a valid 5-letter word with the pattern C H E _ S.

Looking at common English words that fit C H E _ S:

- CHEPS (already tried, P eliminated)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting guess because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.  
Letters we can now eliminate: A, R, O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
3. Has S not in position 4.
4. Has E not in position 5.

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that places S and E in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
""STILE"" uses S, T, I, L, E – none of A, R, O appear.  
Positions: S in 1, E in 5 – but E was originally in 5 (AROSE) and marked wrong position, so E cannot be in 5 again.  
Thus STILE is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SELFS"" – but repeats S and uses F, L.  
Positions: S in 1, E in 2 – both new positions.  
No A, R, O.  
This looks valid.

Another candidate: ""SLEEP"" – but contains E in 5 (invalid).  
""SLICE"" – E in 4, S in 1 – valid.  
""SPEND"" – E in 4, S in 1 – valid.  
""STEIN"" – E in 4, S in 1 – valid.  

""STEIN"" seems good: S(1), T, E(4), I, N.  
No A, R, O.  
S not in 4, E not in 5.  

I’ll go with STEIN.

We now know the exact pattern: C H E _ S  
Only the fourth letter is unknown.  
Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, T, I, N, P, W  
Remaining possible single letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  

Among these, the only common English word that fits C H E _ S is:

- C H E F S  (CHEFS) – but this is plural and less common  
- C H E M S  (CHEMS) – rare  
- C H E L S  – not a word  
- C H E D S  – not a word  
- C H E G S  – not a word  

The only valid word left is **CHEFS** (even though it’s plural), as opposed to the non-word **CHEPS** (which we already ruled out).  
Since no other common word exists, we’ll guess CHEFS.
