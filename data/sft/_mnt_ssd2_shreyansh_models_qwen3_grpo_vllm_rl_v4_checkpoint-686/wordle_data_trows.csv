For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is R
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _
Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E
Letters we know are in the word: R (already placed)

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates:
- BRIAR (but has A which is eliminated)
- BRIEF (has E which is eliminated)
- DRIED (has E which is eliminated)
- FROST (has O, S, T - good letters)
- GROIN (has O, I, N - but N is eliminated)
- GROPE (has E which is eliminated)
- TROOP (has O, P - but double O might be unlikely)
- BROKE (has E which is eliminated)

Looking at these, ""FROST"" seems good - it has R in position 2, and uses F, O, S, T which are all still possible. It doesn't use any eliminated letters.

But wait, does ""FROST"" have R in position 2? Let me check: F-R-O-S-T → yes, R is in position 2.

Another good option might be ""GROIN"" but N is eliminated. ""TROOP"" has O twice which might be less likely. ""BROTH"" has H which is possible but T and H are good letters.

Actually, ""FROST"" seems the best choice here - it covers new common letters (F, O, S, T) while maintaining the known R in position 2 and avoiding all eliminated letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R O _ _  (R is locked in position 2, O is locked in position 3)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F
3. Letters definitely IN the word: R (position 2), O (position 3), S (somewhere), T (somewhere)
4. S and T are both in the word but are in the wrong positions in FROST.  
   - In FROST, S was in position 4 → so S must be in 1 or 5.
   - In FROST, T was in position 5 → so T must be in 1 or 4.

Possible positions for S and T:
- If S is in 1, then T must be in 4 → word: S R O _ T
- If S is in 5, then T must be in 4 → word: _ R O T S

We also know:
- No C, A, N, E, F
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already used)

Let’s explore the two patterns:

1. S R O _ T
   - The blank (position 4) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already placed (R, O, S, T).
   - Possible letters for position 4: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Good candidates: SROBT, SRODT, SROIT, etc. But we need valid 5-letter words.

2. _ R O T S
   - The blank (position 1) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already used (R, O, T, S).
   - Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Need valid 5-letter words starting with one of these letters and followed by ROTS.

Looking for valid words:
- S R O _ T: ""SRO_T"" – no common words fit this pattern.
- _ R O T S: ""BROTS"", ""DROTS"", ""GROTS"", ""PROTS"" – none are valid except ""BROTS"" (not a word), ""DROTS"" (not a word), ""GROTS"" (not a word), ""PROTS"" (not a word). 
- ""GROTS"" is not valid, but ""GROIN"" was considered earlier and N is eliminated. 
- ""DROOL"" has O but not the pattern.
- ""DROPT"" – but P is possible, but ""DROPT"" is not a common word.
- ""GROVY"" – no.
- ""PROXY"" – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and T in position 4 → _ R O T S. The only valid word fitting this is ""BROTS"" (not valid), ""DROTS"" (not valid), ""GROTS"" (not valid), ""PROTS"" (not valid). 

Actually, ""GROTS"" is not a valid English word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 1 and T in position 4 → S R O T _. The blank (position 5) must be a letter not eliminated and not used yet. Possible: S R O T _ → ""SROTH"" (not a word), ""SROTY"" (not a word), ""SROTS"" (not a word), ""SROTP"" (not a word).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I need to consider that S and T could be in different positions.

Wait, let me list possible words with pattern _ R O _ _ that contain both S and T, with S not in 4 and T not in 5 (since those were their wrong positions in FROST).

Possible positions:
- S in 1, T in 4 → S R O T _ (no valid word)
- S in 1, T in 5 → S R O _ T (no valid word)
- S in 5, T in 1 → T R O _ S (possible word: ""TROPS"", ""TROGS"", ""TROMS"", ""TRODS"")
   - ""TROPS"" – valid (troops)
   - ""TROGS"" – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - ""TRODS"" – valid (trods are steps)
   - ""TROMS"" – not valid

Among these, ""TROPS"" is a common word. Let me check:
- T R O P S
- Letters: T (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5)
- Does this fit all constraints?
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - O is in position 3 (✓)
   - S is in the word (now in position 5, different from position 4 in FROST) (✓)
   - T is in the word (now in position 1, different from position 5 in FROST) (✓)
   - No C, A, N, E, F (✓)
   - P is a new letter to test (✓)

This seems valid. ""TROPS"" is a good next guess.

Wait, let me list possible words with pattern _ R O _ _ that contain both S and T, with S not in 4 and T not in 5 (since those were their wrong positions in FROST).

Possible positions:
- S in 1, T in 4 → S R O T _ (no valid word)
- S in 1, T in 5 → S R O _ T (no valid word)
- S in 5, T in 1 → T R O _ S (possible word: ""TROPS"", ""TROGS"", ""TROMS"", ""TRODS"")
   - ""TROPS"" – valid (troops)
   - ""TROGS"" – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - ""TRODS"" – valid (trods are steps)
   - ""TROMS"" – not valid

Among these, ""TROPS"" is a common word. Let me check:
- T R O P S
- Letters: T (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5)
- Does this fit all constraints?
   - R is in position 2 (✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is R
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _
Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E
Letters we know are in the word: R (already placed)

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates:
- BRIAR (but has A which is eliminated)
- BRIEF (has E which is eliminated)
- DRIED (has E which is eliminated)
- FROST (has O, S, T - good letters)
- GROIN (has O, I, N - but N is eliminated)
- GROPE (has E which is eliminated)
- TROOP (has O, P - but double O might be unlikely)
- BROKE (has E which is eliminated)

Looking at these, ""FROST"" seems good - it has R in position 2, and uses F, O, S, T which are all still possible. It doesn't use any eliminated letters.

But wait, does ""FROST"" have R in position 2? Let me check: F-R-O-S-T → yes, R is in position 2.

Another good option might be ""GROIN"" but N is eliminated. ""TROOP"" has O twice which might be less likely. ""BROTH"" has H which is possible but T and H are good letters.

Actually, ""FROST"" seems the best choice here - it covers new common letters (F, O, S, T) while maintaining the known R in position 2 and avoiding all eliminated letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R O _ _  (R is locked in position 2, O is locked in position 3)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F
3. Letters definitely IN the word: R (position 2), O (position 3), S (somewhere), T (somewhere)
4. S and T are both in the word but are in the wrong positions in FROST.  
   - In FROST, S was in position 4 → so S must be in 1 or 5.
   - In FROST, T was in position 5 → so T must be in 1 or 4.

Possible positions for S and T:
- If S is in 1, then T must be in 4 → word: S R O _ T
- If S is in 5, then T must be in 4 → word: _ R O T S

We also know:
- No C, A, N, E, F
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already used)

Let’s explore the two patterns:

1. S R O _ T
   - The blank (position 4) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already placed (R, O, S, T).
   - Possible letters for position 4: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Good candidates: SROBT, SRODT, SROIT, etc. But we need valid 5-letter words.

2. _ R O T S
   - The blank (position 1) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already used (R, O, T, S).
   - Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Need valid 5-letter words starting with one of these letters and followed by ROTS.

Looking for valid words:
- S R O _ T: ""SRO_T"" – no common words fit this pattern.
- _ R O T S: ""BROTS"", ""DROTS"", ""GROTS"", ""PROTS"" – none are valid except ""BROTS"" (not a word), ""DROTS"" (not a word), ""GROTS"" (not a word), ""PROTS"" (not a word). 
- ""GROTS"" is not valid, but ""GROIN"" was considered earlier and N is eliminated. 
- ""DROOL"" has O but not the pattern.
- ""DROPT"" – but P is possible, but ""DROPT"" is not a common word.
- ""GROVY"" – no.
- ""PROXY"" – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and T in position 4 → _ R O T S. The only valid word fitting this is ""BROTS"" (not valid), ""DROTS"" (not valid), ""GROTS"" (not valid), ""PROTS"" (not valid). 

Actually, ""GROTS"" is not a valid English word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 1 and T in position 4 → S R O T _. The blank (position 5) must be a letter not eliminated and not used yet. Possible: S R O T _ → ""SROTH"" (not a word), ""SROTY"" (not a word), ""SROTS"" (not a word), ""SROTP"" (not a word).

- S in 1, T in 5 → S R O _ T (no valid word)

   - ""TROPS"" – valid (troops)
   - ""TROGS"" – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - ""TRODS"" – valid (trods are steps)
   - ""TROMS"" – not valid

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R O _ _  (R is locked in position 2, O is locked in position 3)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F
3. Letters definitely IN the word: R (position 2), O (position 3), S (somewhere), T (somewhere)
4. S and T are both in the word but are in the wrong positions in FROST.  
   - In FROST, S was in position 4 → so S must be in 1 or 5.
   - In FROST, T was in position 5 → so T must be in 1 or 4.

Possible positions for S and T:
- If S is in 1, then T must be in 4 → word: S R O _ T
- If S is in 5, then T must be in 4 → word: _ R O T S

We also know:
- No C, A, N, E, F
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already used)

Let’s explore the two patterns:

1. S R O _ T
   - The blank (position 4) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already placed (R, O, S, T).
   - Possible letters for position 4: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Good candidates: SROBT, SRODT, SROIT, etc. But we need valid 5-letter words.

2. _ R O T S
   - The blank (position 1) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already used (R, O, T, S).
   - Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Need valid 5-letter words starting with one of these letters and followed by ROTS.

Looking for valid words:
- S R O _ T: ""SRO_T"" – no common words fit this pattern.
- _ R O T S: ""BROTS"", ""DROTS"", ""GROTS"", ""PROTS"" – none are valid except ""BROTS"" (not a word), ""DROTS"" (not a word), ""GROTS"" (not a word), ""PROTS"" (not a word). 
- ""GROTS"" is not valid, but ""GROIN"" was considered earlier and N is eliminated. 
- ""DROOL"" has O but not the pattern.
- ""DROPT"" – but P is possible, but ""DROPT"" is not a common word.
- ""GROVY"" – no.
- ""PROXY"" – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and T in position 4 → _ R O T S. The only valid word fitting this is ""BROTS"" (not valid), ""DROTS"" (not valid), ""GROTS"" (not valid), ""PROTS"" (not valid). 

Actually, ""GROTS"" is not a valid English word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 1 and T in position 4 → S R O T _. The blank (position 5) must be a letter not eliminated and not used yet. Possible: S R O T _ → ""SROTH"" (not a word), ""SROTY"" (not a word), ""SROTS"" (not a word), ""SROTP"" (not a word).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I need to consider that S and T could be in different positions.

Wait, let me list possible words with pattern _ R O _ _ that contain both S and T, with S not in 4 and T not in 5 (since those were their wrong positions in FROST).

Possible positions:
- S in 1, T in 4 → S R O T _ (no valid word)
- S in 1, T in 5 → S R O _ T (no valid word)
- S in 5, T in 1 → T R O _ S (possible word: ""TROPS"", ""TROGS"", ""TROMS"", ""TRODS"")
   - ""TROPS"" – valid (troops)
   - ""TROGS"" – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - ""TRODS"" – valid (trods are steps)
   - ""TROMS"" – not valid

Among these, ""TROPS"" is a common word. Let me check:
- T R O P S
- Letters: T (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5)
- Does this fit all constraints?
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - O is in position 3 (✓)
   - S is in the word (now in position 5, different from position 4 in FROST) (✓)
   - T is in the word (now in position 1, different from position 5 in FROST) (✓)
   - No C, A, N, E, F (✓)
   - P is a new letter to test (✓)

This seems valid. ""TROPS"" is a good next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. Pattern so far: T R O _ S  
   (T is correct in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, S in 5; only position 4 is unknown.)

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, P  
   (from CRANE, FROST, TROPS feedback)

3. Letters confirmed IN the word and in their exact positions: T, R, O, S  
   (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)

4. Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that:
   - has not been eliminated (not C, A, N, E, F, P)
   - is not already used in the word (T, R, O, S)

5. Remaining possible letters for position 4 (from the alphabet minus known exclusions):  
   B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form T R O _ S.

   Checking common words:
   - TROBS – not valid
   - TRODS – valid (trods are steps or the sound they make)
   - TROGS – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - TROMS – not valid
   - TROKS – not valid
   - TROLK – not valid
   - TROIS – not valid
   - TROPS – already tried (P is excluded)
   - TROUT – has T in position 4, but T is already in position 1; double T is possible, but let’s check: T R O U T – this is a valid word (a type of fish)

7. Between the valid options (TRODS, TROGS, TROUT), TROUT is the most common word and uses the new letter U (position 4), which hasn’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next guess should be TROUT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is R
- A, N, E are NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _
Letters we can eliminate: C, A, N, E
Letters we know are in the word: R (already placed)

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position
2. Does NOT contain C, A, N, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good candidates:
- BRIAR (but has A which is eliminated)
- BRIEF (has E which is eliminated)
- DRIED (has E which is eliminated)
- FROST (has O, S, T - good letters)
- GROIN (has O, I, N - but N is eliminated)
- GROPE (has E which is eliminated)
- TROOP (has O, P - but double O might be unlikely)
- BROKE (has E which is eliminated)

Looking at these, ""FROST"" seems good - it has R in position 2, and uses F, O, S, T which are all still possible. It doesn't use any eliminated letters.

But wait, does ""FROST"" have R in position 2? Let me check: F-R-O-S-T → yes, R is in position 2.

Another good option might be ""GROIN"" but N is eliminated. ""TROOP"" has O twice which might be less likely. ""BROTH"" has H which is possible but T and H are good letters.

Actually, ""FROST"" seems the best choice here - it covers new common letters (F, O, S, T) while maintaining the known R in position 2 and avoiding all eliminated letters.

- If S is in 1, then T must be in 4 → word: S R O _ T
- If S is in 5, then T must be in 4 → word: _ R O T S

We also know:
- No C, A, N, E, F
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already used)

Let’s explore the two patterns:

1. S R O _ T
   - The blank (position 4) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already placed (R, O, S, T).
   - Possible letters for position 4: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Good candidates: SROBT, SRODT, SROIT, etc. But we need valid 5-letter words.

2. _ R O T S
   - The blank (position 1) must be a letter not yet eliminated and not already used (R, O, T, S).
   - Possible letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Need valid 5-letter words starting with one of these letters and followed by ROTS.

Looking for valid words:
- S R O _ T: ""SRO_T"" – no common words fit this pattern.
- _ R O T S: ""BROTS"", ""DROTS"", ""GROTS"", ""PROTS"" – none are valid except ""BROTS"" (not a word), ""DROTS"" (not a word), ""GROTS"" (not a word), ""PROTS"" (not a word). 
- ""GROTS"" is not valid, but ""GROIN"" was considered earlier and N is eliminated. 
- ""DROOL"" has O but not the pattern.
- ""DROPT"" – but P is possible, but ""DROPT"" is not a common word.
- ""GROVY"" – no.
- ""PROXY"" – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and T in position 4 → _ R O T S. The only valid word fitting this is ""BROTS"" (not valid), ""DROTS"" (not valid), ""GROTS"" (not valid), ""PROTS"" (not valid). 

Actually, ""GROTS"" is not a valid English word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 1 and T in position 4 → S R O T _. The blank (position 5) must be a letter not eliminated and not used yet. Possible: S R O T _ → ""SROTH"" (not a word), ""SROTY"" (not a word), ""SROTS"" (not a word), ""SROTP"" (not a word).

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I need to consider that S and T could be in different positions.

Wait, let me list possible words with pattern _ R O _ _ that contain both S and T, with S not in 4 and T not in 5 (since those were their wrong positions in FROST).

Possible positions:
- S in 1, T in 4 → S R O T _ (no valid word)
- S in 1, T in 5 → S R O _ T (no valid word)
- S in 5, T in 1 → T R O _ S (possible word: ""TROPS"", ""TROGS"", ""TROMS"", ""TRODS"")
   - ""TROPS"" – valid (troops)
   - ""TROGS"" – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - ""TRODS"" – valid (trods are steps)
   - ""TROMS"" – not valid

Among these, ""TROPS"" is a common word. Let me check:
- T R O P S
- Letters: T (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3), P (position 4), S (position 5)
- Does this fit all constraints?
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - O is in position 3 (✓)
   - S is in the word (now in position 5, different from position 4 in FROST) (✓)
   - T is in the word (now in position 1, different from position 5 in FROST) (✓)
   - No C, A, N, E, F (✓)
   - P is a new letter to test (✓)

This seems valid. ""TROPS"" is a good next guess.

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, F, P  
   (from CRANE, FROST, TROPS feedback)

3. Letters confirmed IN the word and in their exact positions: T, R, O, S  
   (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)

4. Therefore, position 4 must be a letter that:
   - has not been eliminated (not C, A, N, E, F, P)
   - is not already used in the word (T, R, O, S)

5. Remaining possible letters for position 4 (from the alphabet minus known exclusions):  
   B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form T R O _ S.

   - TROBS – not valid
   - TRODS – valid (trods are steps or the sound they make)
   - TROGS – valid (trogs are a type of creature)
   - TROMS – not valid
   - TROKS – not valid

   - TROUT – has T in position 4, but T is already in position 1; double T is possible, but let’s check: T R O U T – this is a valid word (a type of fish)

7. Between the valid options (TRODS, TROGS, TROUT), TROUT is the most common word and uses the new letter U (position 4), which hasn’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next guess should be TROUT.
