For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they include common letters.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must avoid those letters entirely.

We still want a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, J, Q, (no duplicates).

A good second-guess candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Uses 4 new common letters (U, N, T, I, L)
- All letters are still possible
- Covers vowels U, I and consonants N, T, L
- No repeats

Other good options would be “CHILD”, “MOUNT”, or “BLUNT”, but “UNTIL” is simple and covers a nice spread.

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and they cannot be in the 2nd and 4th positions respectively (from UNTIL).  
The remaining letters to try must be chosen from the unused, high-frequency set: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Places N somewhere other than position 2
- Places I somewhere other than position 4

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
One such word is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new letters
- Contains both required letters N and I
- N is in position 4 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)

Another candidate is “WHINN” but that repeats N, and “PINNY” repeats Y.  
“CHINK” seems cleanest.

Let’s verify:
- Letters in CHINK: C, H, I, N, K  
- All five letters are still possible (none are in the forbidden set)  
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 4)  
- I is not in position 4 (it’s in 3)

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
N, I  

That means the secret word must contain both N and I exactly once each, and they must occupy positions other than:

- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNTIL) or position 4 (from CHINK)  
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL) or position 3 (from CHINK)

So possible positions left for N: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions left for I: 1, 2, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I only  
- Uses none of the forbidden letters above  
- Places N and I in allowed positions

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they include common letters.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must avoid those letters entirely.

We still want a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, J, Q, (no duplicates).

A good second-guess candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Uses 4 new common letters (U, N, T, I, L)
- All letters are still possible
- Covers vowels U, I and consonants N, T, L
- No repeats

Other good options would be “CHILD”, “MOUNT”, or “BLUNT”, but “UNTIL” is simple and covers a nice spread.

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and they cannot be in the 2nd and 4th positions respectively (from UNTIL).  
The remaining letters to try must be chosen from the unused, high-frequency set: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Places N somewhere other than position 2
- Places I somewhere other than position 4

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
One such word is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new letters
- Contains both required letters N and I
- N is in position 4 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)

Another candidate is “WHINN” but that repeats N, and “PINNY” repeats Y.  
“CHINK” seems cleanest.

Let’s verify:
- Letters in CHINK: C, H, I, N, K  
- All five letters are still possible (none are in the forbidden set)  
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 4)  
- I is not in position 4 (it’s in 3)  

Looks good.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they include common letters.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It doesn't repeat any letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we must avoid those letters entirely.

We still want a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.  
Looking at the remaining high-frequency letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Z, X, J, Q, (no duplicates).

A good second-guess candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Uses 4 new common letters (U, N, T, I, L)
- All letters are still possible
- Covers vowels U, I and consonants N, T, L
- No repeats

Other good options would be “CHILD”, “MOUNT”, or “BLUNT”, but “UNTIL” is simple and covers a nice spread.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and they cannot be in the 2nd and 4th positions respectively (from UNTIL).  
The remaining letters to try must be chosen from the unused, high-frequency set: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Places N somewhere other than position 2
- Places I somewhere other than position 4

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
One such word is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are new letters
- Contains both required letters N and I
- N is in position 4 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)

Another candidate is “WHINN” but that repeats N, and “PINNY” repeats Y.  
“CHINK” seems cleanest.

Let’s verify:
- Letters in CHINK: C, H, I, N, K  
- All five letters are still possible (none are in the forbidden set)  
- N is not in position 2 (it’s in 4)  
- I is not in position 4 (it’s in 3)  

Looks good.

So far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K  

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
N, I  

That means the secret word must contain both N and I exactly once each, and they must occupy positions other than:

- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNTIL) or position 4 (from CHINK)  
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL) or position 3 (from CHINK)

So possible positions left for N: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions left for I: 1, 2, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I only  
- Uses none of the forbidden letters above  
- Places N and I in allowed positions  

Remaining common letters to fill the other three slots: D, F, G, M, P, V, W, Y, B, etc.

Let’s list candidate words that fit:

1. N _ _ _ I → “NIMBY” (but Y is allowed, B is allowed)  
   - N is in 1 (allowed)  
   - I is in 5 (allowed)  
   - Letters used: N, I, M, B, Y — all still possible  
   - No repeats, no forbidden letters  

2. _ N _ I _ → “NINNY” (repeats N, invalid)  
3. _ _ N _ I → “DINGY” (but G and Y are allowed)  
   - N is in 3 (allowed)  
   - I is in 5 (allowed)  
   - Letters: D, I, N, G, Y — all allowed  

4. I _ N _ _ → “IVYND” (not a valid English word)  
5. _ I _ N _ → “PINKY” (K is forbidden)  
6. _ _ I _ N → “WIMBY” (but W, I, M, B, Y — all allowed)  
   - N is in 5 (allowed)  
   - I is in 3 (but I cannot be in 3 from CHINK feedback) — invalid  

So the best valid candidates are:
- NIMBY (N1, I5)  
- DINGY (N3, I5)  

Both are valid English words.  
Let’s pick NIMBY first because it places I in position 5 (new spot) and N in 1 (new spot), giving maximum new information.

From the latest feedback:

- N is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the word and is now confirmed in position 2.
- M and B are NOT in the word.
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K, M, B  
Letters confirmed in the word: I (position 2), Y  
Letter N must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 4. Possible positions: 3 or 5.  
We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Contains N in position 3 or 5.
- Contains Y somewhere except position 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining letters to try: D, F, G, P, V, W, (N, I, Y already known).

Possible patterns:
- _ I N _ _  (N in 3)
- _ I _ _ N  (N in 5)

We also know Y must fit in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s list candidate words:

1. D I N Y _  → DINGY (but G is allowed, Y is allowed, but N is in 3, Y in 4)  
   - Letters: D, I, N, G, Y — all allowed  
   - I is in 2 ✓  
   - N is in 3 (allowed)  
   - Y is in 4 (allowed)  
   - No forbidden letters  

2. W I N D Y  → WINDY  
   - W, I, N, D, Y — all allowed  
   - I in 2 ✓  
   - N in 3 ✓  
   - Y in 5 (but Y cannot be in 5 from feedback) → invalid  

3. P I N Y _  → PINNY (repeats N) → invalid  
4. F I N D Y  → FINDY (valid word?) — may not be common  
5. V I N D Y  → VINDY — not standard  

DINGY fits all constraints perfectly.

Let’s verify:
- D I N G Y  
- I is in position 2 ✓  
- N is in position 3 (not 1,2,4) ✓  
- Y is in position 4 (not 5) ✓
