For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving us maximum coverage for elimination or confirmation purposes. This should provide good information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones) are: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try a word that uses several of these, especially focusing on placing E in a different position. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is ""UNTIE"" but let’s think of ""TUNED"" or ""LINED"". 

""LINED"" is a good option:
- Contains E in position 4.
- Uses L, I, N, D, which are all still possible.
- Common word.

But ""UNTIE"" is also valid. Let’s go with ""UNTIE"" as it uses slightly more common letters (U, N, T, I, E).

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E was only marked as wrong position in AROSE (position 5). 

Another good option is ""ELITE"":
- E in position 1 (new position).
- Uses L, I, T, E.
- All letters are still possible.

But ""ELITE"" might be too similar to AROSE in letter choice. Let’s try ""UNTIE"".

But actually, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all good. However, ""UNTIE"" might be less common. Let’s go with ""ELITE"" as it's very common and uses E in position 1.

But looking back, ""ELITE"" has E in position 1 and 4, which might not be optimal. Let’s try ""LINED"" instead.

After reconsideration, ""UNTIE"" seems better as it uses more common letters and avoids repetition of eliminated letters.

But to maximize information, let’s choose ""UNTIE"".

Final choice: ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E with E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).

- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving us maximum coverage for elimination or confirmation purposes. This should provide good information regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones) are: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try a word that uses several of these, especially focusing on placing E in a different position. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is ""UNTIE"" but let’s think of ""TUNED"" or ""LINED"". 

""LINED"" is a good option:
- Contains E in position 4.
- Uses L, I, N, D, which are all still possible.
- Common word.

But ""UNTIE"" is also valid. Let’s go with ""UNTIE"" as it uses slightly more common letters (U, N, T, I, E).

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E was only marked as wrong position in AROSE (position 5). 

Another good option is ""ELITE"":
- E in position 1 (new position).
- Uses L, I, T, E.
- All letters are still possible.

But ""ELITE"" might be too similar to AROSE in letter choice. Let’s try ""UNTIE"".

But actually, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all good. However, ""UNTIE"" might be less common. Let’s go with ""ELITE"" as it's very common and uses E in position 1.

But looking back, ""ELITE"" has E in position 1 and 4, which might not be optimal. Let’s try ""LINED"" instead.

After reconsideration, ""UNTIE"" seems better as it uses more common letters and avoids repetition of eliminated letters.

But to maximize information, let’s choose ""UNTIE"".

Final choice: ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E with E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, E

So the secret word must contain both N and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-possible set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 5 again (from UNTIE), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNTIE), so N must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Contains both N and E.
2. Uses as many new, common letters as possible from the still-allowed set.
3. Places N and E in positions we haven’t tested yet.

Good remaining common letters: L, D, G, H, M, P, B, C, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- NELLY – uses N, E, L, Y, but L and Y are both in positions we haven’t tested yet.
- DANCE – uses D, A, N, C, E, but A is eliminated.
- PENCE – uses P, E, N, C, E – but E is repeated, and we don’t know if E can appear twice.
- NERVE – uses N, E, R, V, E – but R is eliminated.
- BENCH – uses B, E, N, C, H – all letters are allowed, and we haven’t tested B, C, H yet.

""BENCH"" looks like the best choice: it contains both required letters (N, E), uses three new common letters (B, C, H), and avoids all eliminated letters.

Current knowledge:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  

Letters still possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 2nd letter = E  
- 3rd letter = N  
- 1st, 4th, 5th letters chosen from the still-allowed set.

Pattern: _ E N _ _

We also know:
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (from BENCH feedback: H(-)).
So H must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list common words that fit _ E N _ _ with H in position 1 or 4:

- H E N _ _ → HEN_ _ (HENNY, HENTs, but HENNY is a name, HENT not a word)
- _ E N H _ → _ENH_ (no common words)

Looking at remaining letters, let’s try HENGY? Not a word.  
Next, think of _ E N _ H with H in position 5. Then the word ends with H.

Words ending in H:  
- DENGH – not valid  
- FENGH – not valid  
- GENGH – not valid  
- MENGH – not valid  
- PENGH – not valid  

None of these are real words.  
Try H in position 1: H E N _ _  
Real words: HENNE (a plant), HENNY (nickname), but neither is common.

Next, think of other consonants for positions 1 and 4/5.  
For example:  
- G E N E R – but R is out  
- F E N E R – R out  
- L E N S E – S out  
- P E N E L – not a word  
- M E N E D – not a word  

Wait, H must be in the word somewhere (from BENCH feedback: H(-)), and we haven’t placed it yet.  
Let’s try:  
- _ E N H _ → need a first letter and a fifth letter from allowed set.  
Allowed letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Possible combinations:  
- D E N H _ → D E N H ? → D E N H O – but O is out  
- L E N H _ → L E N H ? → L E N H A – A out  
- M E N H _ → M E N H ? → M E N H O – O out  
- P E N H _ → P E N H ? → P E N H A – A out  

No valid words here.  
Try H in position 4: _ E N H _  
Then fifth letter must be from allowed set:  
- D E N H ? → D E N H Y – D E N H Y is not a word  
- F E N H ? → F E N H Y – not a word  
- G E N H ? → G E N H Y – not a word  

Hmm. Maybe the word is _ E N _ H with H in position 5.  
Then first letter:  
- D E N _ H → D E N ? H → D E N N H – not a word  
- F E N _ H → F E N ? H → F E N N H – not a word  
- G E N _ H → G E N ? H → G E N N H – not a word  
- L E N _ H → L E N ? H → L E N N H – not a word  
- M E N _ H → M E N ? H → M E N N H – not a word  
- P E N _ H → P E N ? H → P E N N H – not a word  

None of these are valid.  
Let me think differently: maybe the word is _ E N _ _ with H in position 1 or 4, and other letters from allowed set.  

Looking up valid 5-letter words with pattern _ E N _ _ and containing H:  
- H E N G E – H E N G E (a type of plant, but not common)  
- H E N D Y – not a word  
- P E N G E – no H  
- L E N H O – not a word  

Wait, ""HENGY"" isn't a word. ""HENNE"" is a word (a plant genus).  
Let me check: H E N N E – but N is already in position 3, so this would be H E N N E, which has N in position 3 and 4. Is this possible? The feedback didn't say N is only in position 3, just that N is in the word. So multiple N's might be allowed.  

But ""HENNE"" is a valid word (though obscure).  

Another option: ""VENNY"" – but V and Y are allowed, but no H.  

Wait, we must include H somewhere.  

Let me list all possible _ E N _ _ words with H in position 1 or 4:  

Position 1 = H:  
- H E N _ _ → H E N ? ?  
  - H E N G E – valid (though rare)  
  - H E N D Y – not a word  
  - H E N N E – valid (but double N)  

Position 4 = H:  
- _ E N H _ → ? E N H ?  
  - D E N H Y – not a word  
  - F E N H Y – not a word  

So the only possible valid words seem to be:  
- HENGE  
- HENNE  

""HENGE"" is more familiar (a megalithic structure). Let’s try HENGE.

Check letters:  
H – allowed (not in banned list)  
E – in position 2 (matches ✓)  
N – in position 3 (matches ✓)  
G – allowed  
E – allowed (second E is fine)  

So HENGE fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), giving us maximum coverage for elimination or confirmation purposes. This should provide good information regardless of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains E somewhere (positions 1-4 allowed).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones) are: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s try a word that uses several of these, especially focusing on placing E in a different position. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Uses U, N, T, I, which are all still possible.

However, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. But let’s see if we can do better with more common letters. Another candidate is ""UNTIE"" but let’s think of ""TUNED"" or ""LINED"". 

""LINED"" is a good option:
- Contains E in position 4.
- Uses L, I, N, D, which are all still possible.
- Common word.

But ""UNTIE"" is also valid. Let’s go with ""UNTIE"" as it uses slightly more common letters (U, N, T, I, E).

Wait, ""UNTIE"" has E in position 4, which is allowed since E was only marked as wrong position in AROSE (position 5). 

Another good option is ""ELITE"":
- E in position 1 (new position).
- Uses L, I, T, E.
- All letters are still possible.

But ""ELITE"" might be too similar to AROSE in letter choice. Let’s try ""UNTIE"".

But actually, ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all good. However, ""UNTIE"" might be less common. Let’s go with ""ELITE"" as it's very common and uses E in position 1.

But looking back, ""ELITE"" has E in position 1 and 4, which might not be optimal. Let’s try ""LINED"" instead.

After reconsideration, ""UNTIE"" seems better as it uses more common letters and avoids repetition of eliminated letters.

But to maximize information, let’s choose ""UNTIE"".

Final choice: ""UNTIE"" - uses U, N, T, I, E with E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, U, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, E

So the secret word must contain both N and E, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-possible set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 5 again (from UNTIE), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNTIE), so N must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Contains both N and E.
2. Uses as many new, common letters as possible from the still-allowed set.
3. Places N and E in positions we haven’t tested yet.

Good remaining common letters: L, D, G, H, M, P, B, C, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- NELLY – uses N, E, L, Y, but L and Y are both in positions we haven’t tested yet.
- DANCE – uses D, A, N, C, E, but A is eliminated.
- PENCE – uses P, E, N, C, E – but E is repeated, and we don’t know if E can appear twice.
- NERVE – uses N, E, R, V, E – but R is eliminated.
- BENCH – uses B, E, N, C, H – all letters are allowed, and we haven’t tested B, C, H yet.

""BENCH"" looks like the best choice: it contains both required letters (N, E), uses three new common letters (B, C, H), and avoids all eliminated letters.

Current knowledge:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  

Letters still possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(plus any others not yet ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 2nd letter = E  
- 3rd letter = N  
- 1st, 4th, 5th letters chosen from the still-allowed set.

Pattern: _ E N _ _

We also know:
- H is in the word but not in position 5 (from BENCH feedback: H(-)).
So H must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list common words that fit _ E N _ _ with H in position 1 or 4:

- H E N _ _ → HEN_ _ (HENNY, HENTs, but HENNY is a name, HENT not a word)
- _ E N H _ → _ENH_ (no common words)

Looking at remaining letters, let’s try HENGY? Not a word.  
Next, think of _ E N _ H with H in position 5. Then the word ends with H.

Words ending in H:  
- DENGH – not valid  
- FENGH – not valid  
- GENGH – not valid  
- MENGH – not valid  
- PENGH – not valid  

None of these are real words.  
Try H in position 1: H E N _ _  
Real words: HENNE (a plant), HENNY (nickname), but neither is common.

Next, think of other consonants for positions 1 and 4/5.  
For example:  
- G E N E R – but R is out  
- F E N E R – R out  
- L E N S E – S out  
- P E N E L – not a word  
- M E N E D – not a word  

Wait, H must be in the word somewhere (from BENCH feedback: H(-)), and we haven’t placed it yet.  
Let’s try:  
- _ E N H _ → need a first letter and a fifth letter from allowed set.  
Allowed letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Possible combinations:  
- D E N H _ → D E N H ? → D E N H O – but O is out  
- L E N H _ → L E N H ? → L E N H A – A out  
- M E N H _ → M E N H ? → M E N H O – O out  
- P E N H _ → P E N H ? → P E N H A – A out  

No valid words here.  
Try H in position 4: _ E N H _  
Then fifth letter must be from allowed set:  
- D E N H ? → D E N H Y – D E N H Y is not a word  
- F E N H ? → F E N H Y – not a word  
- G E N H ? → G E N H Y – not a word  

Hmm. Maybe the word is _ E N _ H with H in position 5.  
Then first letter:  
- D E N _ H → D E N ? H → D E N N H – not a word  
- F E N _ H → F E N ? H → F E N N H – not a word  
- G E N _ H → G E N ? H → G E N N H – not a word  
- L E N _ H → L E N ? H → L E N N H – not a word  
- M E N _ H → M E N ? H → M E N N H – not a word  
- P E N _ H → P E N ? H → P E N N H – not a word  

None of these are valid.  
Let me think differently: maybe the word is _ E N _ _ with H in position 1 or 4, and other letters from allowed set.  

Looking up valid 5-letter words with pattern _ E N _ _ and containing H:  
- H E N G E – H E N G E (a type of plant, but not common)  
- H E N D Y – not a word  
- P E N G E – no H  
- L E N H O – not a word  

Wait, ""HENGY"" isn't a word. ""HENNE"" is a word (a plant genus).  
Let me check: H E N N E – but N is already in position 3, so this would be H E N N E, which has N in position 3 and 4. Is this possible? The feedback didn't say N is only in position 3, just that N is in the word. So multiple N's might be allowed.  

But ""HENNE"" is a valid word (though obscure).  

Another option: ""VENNY"" – but V and Y are allowed, but no H.  

Wait, we must include H somewhere.  

Let me list all possible _ E N _ _ words with H in position 1 or 4:  

Position 1 = H:  
- H E N _ _ → H E N ? ?  
  - H E N G E – valid (though rare)  
  - H E N D Y – not a word  
  - H E N N E – valid (but double N)  

Position 4 = H:  
- _ E N H _ → ? E N H ?  
  - D E N H Y – not a word  
  - F E N H Y – not a word  

So the only possible valid words seem to be:  
- HENGE  
- HENNE  

""HENGE"" is more familiar (a megalithic structure). Let’s try HENGE.

Check letters:  
H – allowed (not in banned list)  
E – in position 2 (matches ✓)  
N – in position 3 (matches ✓)  
G – allowed  
E – allowed (second E is fine)  

So HENGE fits all constraints.
