### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance to identify at least some correct letters or eliminate many possibilities early on.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- L cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 3

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each (because the feedback only shows one instance of each)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, Y
- Places S, L, I in allowed positions

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: T, N, U, D, C, H, etc.

Let’s try to fit S, L, I plus two new letters into valid positions.

Candidate word: “SLANT” – but A and N are fine, but T is new and N is new, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “STILL” – but L appears twice (invalid, since L only appeared once in feedback).

Next candidate: “SHIFT” – contains F and H, new letters. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next candidate: “CLIPS” – contains C, L, I, P, S. Check positions:
- S is in 5 (allowed)

Next candidate: “BLISS” – B is new, but L is in 2 (invalid).

Let’s update what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y, U

- S – now confirmed in the 5th position (✓)
- N – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- L – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- I – in the word but wrong position (-)  

So the secret word is 5 letters, ends with S, and contains N, L, I somewhere in positions 1-4, each exactly once.

Possible positions for N, L, I among 1-4, with exclusions:
- N cannot be in 2 (from UNLIS feedback)

Known:    _ _ _ _ S

Valid slots:
- N: allowed in 1, 3, 4
- L: allowed in 1, 4
- I: allowed in 1, 2, 4

We need to place N, L, I plus one more letter (must be new, not in A,R,O,E,M,Y,U).

Remaining unused common consonants: T, D, C, H, etc.

Try to form a valid permutation:

Option 1:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance to identify at least some correct letters or eliminate many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since S is the 4th letter in AROSE, it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like “SLIMY” comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- L, I, M, Y are all still possible letters.
- Uses common letters and gives information about 4 new letters.

Other options could be “STING” (but E is out), “SPLIT” (but E is out), etc. “SLIMY” seems balanced.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S, L, I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- L cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 3

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each (because the feedback only shows one instance of each)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, Y
- Places S, L, I in allowed positions

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: T, N, U, D, C, H, etc.

Let’s try to fit S, L, I plus two new letters into valid positions.

Candidate word: “SLANT” – but A and N are fine, but T is new and N is new, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “STILL” – but L appears twice (invalid, since L only appeared once in feedback).

Next candidate: “SHIFT” – contains F and H, new letters. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next candidate: “CLIPS” – contains C, L, I, P, S. Check positions:
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- L is in 2 (invalid, ruled out in guess 2)
  
Next candidate: “BLISS” – B is new, but L is in 2 (invalid).

Next candidate: “FLINT” – F, L, I, N, T. Check positions:
- S is missing (must include S, L, I). So invalid.

Next candidate: “STINK” – S, T, I, N, K. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “STILL” already considered.

Next candidate: “CLIPS” already considered.

Next candidate: “SPILT” – S, P, I, L, T. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “PLISK” – P, L, I, S, K. Check positions:
- S in 4 (invalid, was ruled out in guess 1).

Next candidate: “STILK” – S, T, I, L, K. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLITS” – S, L, I, T, S. Double S (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPLIT” – S, P, L, I, T. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPILL” – S, P, I, L, L. Double L (invalid).

Next candidate: “CLIPS” already considered.

Next candidate: “ULNIS” – U, L, N, I, S. Check positions:
- S in 5 (allowed)
- L in 2 (invalid, ruled out in guess 2)

Next candidate: “UNLIS” – U, N, L, I, S. Check positions:

This seems valid: U, N, L, I, S. Check letters: U, N, L, I, S – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, M, Y). Contains S, L, I in allowed positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear in many 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance to identify at least some correct letters or eliminate many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
Since S is the 4th letter in AROSE, it cannot be in position 4 in the secret word.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A word like “SLIMY” comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- L, I, M, Y are all still possible letters.
- Uses common letters and gives information about 4 new letters.

Other options could be “STING” (but E is out), “SPLIT” (but E is out), etc. “SLIMY” seems balanced.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S, L, I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4
- L cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 3

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, I exactly once each (because the feedback only shows one instance of each)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, Y
- Places S, L, I in allowed positions

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tried: T, N, U, D, C, H, etc.

Let’s try to fit S, L, I plus two new letters into valid positions.

Candidate word: “SLANT” – but A and N are fine, but T is new and N is new, but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “STILL” – but L appears twice (invalid, since L only appeared once in feedback).

Next candidate: “SHIFT” – contains F and H, new letters. Let’s check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid), so skip.

Next candidate: “CLIPS” – contains C, L, I, P, S. Check positions:
- S is in 5 (allowed)
- L is in 2 (invalid, ruled out in guess 2)
  
Next candidate: “BLISS” – B is new, but L is in 2 (invalid).

Next candidate: “FLINT” – F, L, I, N, T. Check positions:
- S is missing (must include S, L, I). So invalid.

Next candidate: “STINK” – S, T, I, N, K. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “STILL” already considered.

Next candidate: “CLIPS” already considered.

Next candidate: “SPILT” – S, P, I, L, T. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “PLISK” – P, L, I, S, K. Check positions:
- S in 4 (invalid, was ruled out in guess 1).

Next candidate: “STILK” – S, T, I, L, K. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLITS” – S, L, I, T, S. Double S (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPLIT” – S, P, L, I, T. Check positions:
- S in 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “SPILL” – S, P, I, L, L. Double L (invalid).

Next candidate: “CLIPS” already considered.

Next candidate: “ULNIS” – U, L, N, I, S. Check positions:
- S in 5 (allowed)
- L in 2 (invalid, ruled out in guess 2)

Next candidate: “UNLIS” – U, N, L, I, S. Check positions:
- S in 5 (allowed)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (allowed)

This seems valid: U, N, L, I, S. Check letters: U, N, L, I, S – none are in the forbidden list (A, R, O, E, M, Y). Contains S, L, I in allowed positions.

So: “UNLIS”.

Let’s update what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y, U  
Letters that ARE in the word (with their current status):
- S – now confirmed in the 5th position (✓)
- N – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- L – in the word but wrong position (-)  
- I – in the word but wrong position (-)  

So the secret word is 5 letters, ends with S, and contains N, L, I somewhere in positions 1-4, each exactly once.

Possible positions for N, L, I among 1-4, with exclusions:
- N cannot be in 2 (from UNLIS feedback)
- L cannot be in 2 (from SLIMY feedback) or 3 (from UNLIS feedback)
- I cannot be in 3 (from SLIMY feedback) or 4 (from UNLIS feedback)

Let’s list valid placements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known:    _ _ _ _ S

Valid slots:
- N: allowed in 1, 3, 4
- L: allowed in 1, 4
- I: allowed in 1, 2, 4

We need to place N, L, I plus one more letter (must be new, not in A,R,O,E,M,Y,U).

Remaining unused common consonants: T, D, C, H, etc.

Try to form a valid permutation:

Option 1:
1: I
2: N
3: L
4: ?
But I cannot be in 1 (no restriction), N cannot be in 2, L cannot be in 3. So 3:L is invalid.

Option 2:
1: N
2: I
3: ?
4: L
Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed
- I in 2: allowed
- L in 4: allowed
Need a letter for position 3 that’s unused and valid. Good candidate: T → “NITLS” – not a word.

Option 3:
1: I
2: L
3: N
4: ?
I in 1: allowed
L in 2: NOT allowed (L cannot be in 2)
Discard.

Option 4:
1: L
2: I
3: N
4: ?
L in 1: allowed
I in 2: allowed
N in 3: allowed
Need letter for 4: T → “LIN T S” → “LINTS” – valid word.

Check letters: L, I, N, T, S – none forbidden. Contains required letters and positions.

So: LINTS.
