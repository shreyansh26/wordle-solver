For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good range of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: in word but wrong position (-)
- S: in word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in word (x)

So the secret word contains the letters O and S, but they are in different positions than in AROSE (O was 3rd, S was 4th). It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4
4. Avoids A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let me think of words that fit:
- SOOTH: has O and S, but contains H and T which might be useful
- STOIC: has O and S, but contains C and I
- SOLID: has O and S, but contains L, I, D
- STONY: has O and S, but contains T, N, Y

Looking at these, ""STOIC"" seems good because:
- S is in position 1 (new position)
- T, O, I, C are all new letters
- O is in position 3 (same as before - but we know it's wrong, so this is bad)

Wait, O was in position 3 in AROSE and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me reconsider.

""SOOTH"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - this seems valid.
""STOIC"" has O in position 3 - invalid (same as before)
""STONY"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - valid
""SOLAR"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1, but contains A (invalid)
""STOPE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOKE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOCK"" has O in position 3 - invalid

""SOOTH"" and ""STONY"" seem best. Between them, ""SOOTH"" uses O in position 2 and S in position 1, and introduces T and H which are common letters.

- R: not in word (x)
- O: in word but wrong position (-)
- S: in word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in word (x)

So the secret word contains the letters O and S, but they are in different positions than in AROSE (O was 3rd, S was 4th). It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4
4. Avoids A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let me think of words that fit:
- SOOTH: has O and S, but contains H and T which might be useful
- STOIC: has O and S, but contains C and I
- SOLID: has O and S, but contains L, I, D
- STONY: has O and S, but contains T, N, Y

Looking at these, ""STOIC"" seems good because:
- S is in position 1 (new position)
- T, O, I, C are all new letters
- O is in position 3 (same as before - but we know it's wrong, so this is bad)

Wait, O was in position 3 in AROSE and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me reconsider.

""SOOTH"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - this seems valid.
""STOIC"" has O in position 3 - invalid (same as before)
""STONY"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - valid
""SOLAR"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1, but contains A (invalid)
""STOPE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOKE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOCK"" has O in position 3 - invalid

""SOOTH"" and ""STONY"" seem best. Between them, ""SOOTH"" uses O in position 2 and S in position 1, and introduces T and H which are common letters.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is already O), so 3 or 5

We need a 5-letter word with:

- _ O _ _ S  (S in 5th)

But ""BONUS"" has S in 5th, O in 2nd, and uses B, N, U which are allowed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: not in word (x)
- O: in word but wrong position (-)
- S: in word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in word (x)

So the secret word contains the letters O and S, but they are in different positions than in AROSE (O was 3rd, S was 4th). It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4
4. Avoids A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let me think of words that fit:
- SOOTH: has O and S, but contains H and T which might be useful
- STOIC: has O and S, but contains C and I
- SOLID: has O and S, but contains L, I, D
- STONY: has O and S, but contains T, N, Y

Looking at these, ""STOIC"" seems good because:
- S is in position 1 (new position)
- T, O, I, C are all new letters
- O is in position 3 (same as before - but we know it's wrong, so this is bad)

Wait, O was in position 3 in AROSE and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me reconsider.

""SOOTH"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - this seems valid.
""STOIC"" has O in position 3 - invalid (same as before)
""STONY"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1 - valid
""SOLAR"" has O in position 2 and S in position 1, but contains A (invalid)
""STOPE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOKE"" has O in position 3 - invalid
""STOCK"" has O in position 3 - invalid

""SOOTH"" and ""STONY"" seem best. Between them, ""SOOTH"" uses O in position 2 and S in position 1, and introduces T and H which are common letters.

From the new feedback on SOOTH:
- S: in word but wrong position (-)  (same as before)
- O: in word and in correct position (✓)  (so O is in position 2)
- O: in word but wrong position (-)  (second O in position 3, but we already know it's in position 2)
- T: not in word (x)
- H: not in word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters in word: O (position 2), S
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, E, T, H
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOOTH feedback)

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is already O), so 3 or 5
Possible positions for O: fixed at 2

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- S in position 3 or 5
- No A, R, E, T, H
- Other letters must be from remaining alphabet

Possible words:
- _ O _ S _  (S in 4th - but S can't be 4th from AROSE feedback)
- _ O S _ _  (S in 3rd)
- _ O _ _ S  (S in 5th)

Looking at common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's try:
- POSIT: but T is excluded
- POSSE: but E is excluded
- COYS: too short
- FOSSA: but A is excluded
- GOSPEL: too long
- MOSSY: but S is in position 4 (invalid)
- NOSSY: same issue
- POSSE: E excluded
- POSIT: T excluded
- COBIS: but B is allowed, but S is in position 4 (invalid)
- COGIS: G is allowed, S in position 4 (invalid)
- COVIS: V is allowed, S in position 4 (invalid)
- COYS: too short
- FOIST: T excluded
- GOSSY: S in position 4 (invalid)
- MOSSY: same
- NOSSY: same
- POSIT: T excluded
- ROSSY: R excluded
- TOSSY: T excluded

Alternative: _ O _ _ S (S in 5th)
Possible words:
- BONUS: N, U allowed
- CLOUD: but S not in 5th
- COBYS: but Y is allowed, but S is in 5th
- COGYS: Y allowed
- COBYS: but B, Y allowed
- COGYS: G, Y allowed
- COBYS: seems possible

But ""BONUS"" has S in 5th, O in 2nd, and uses B, N, U which are allowed
""BONUS"" also has U, N which are new letters

Let's check:
B: allowed
O: correct position 2
N: allowed
U: allowed
S: in word but position 5 (allowed since S can't be 1,3,4)

This seems valid.

Letters confirmed in word: O, N, S

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O N _ S, using only letters not yet excluded.
Possible remaining letters (from alphabet excluding the banned ones): C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common words:
- CONES: E is excluded
- CONYS: but Y is allowed, but is it a word?
- CONKS: K is allowed
- CONES: E excluded
- CONIS: I is allowed
- CONGS: G is allowed
- CONMS: M is allowed
- CONPS: P is allowed
- CONVS: V is allowed
- CONWS: W is allowed
- CONYS: Y is allowed

The most common word among these is ""CONES"", but E is excluded.
Next is ""CONIS"" (a type of plant), but is it valid?
""CONKS"" is a valid word (to conk something).
""CONGS"" is not a valid word.
""CONMS"" is not a word.
""CONPS"" is not a word.

From the feedback on PONDS:
- P: not in word (x)
- O: correct position 2 (✓)
- N: correct position 3 (✓)
- D: in word but wrong position (-)
- S: correct position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is still _ O N _ S, and we now know:
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, E, T, H, B, U, C, K, P
- Letter D is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Therefore, D must be in position 1 (since positions 2,3,5 are already taken by O, N, S respectively).

So the word must be D O N _ S.

The only remaining letter for position 4 must be from the allowed set: F, G, I, L, M, V, W, Y (excluding all previously excluded letters).

Looking for a valid 5-letter word: D O N ? S.

Possible options:
- DONGS – G is allowed, and it's a valid word.
- DONIS – I is allowed, but ""DONIS"" is not a standard word.
- DONFS – not a word.
- DONGS – G is allowed, but ""DONGS"" is not standard.
- DONMS – not a word.
- DONVS – not a word.
- DONWS – not a word.
- DONYS – not a word.

The only valid word here is ""DONGS"".
