For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes two vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of S, L, A, T. We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Contains none of S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CHIME (but M and H are less common)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- DRONE (D, R, O, N, E - all allowed)

""PRONE"" seems like a good choice because it tests P, R, O, N - all common letters not yet eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes two vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of S, L, A, T. We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Contains none of S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CHIME (but M and H are less common)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- DRONE (D, R, O, N, E - all allowed)

""PRONE"" seems like a good choice because it tests P, R, O, N - all common letters not yet eliminated.

Guess 2: PRONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is the final letter.  
   – S, L, A, T are completely absent.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – P, R, O are absent.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains N somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, P, R, O.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O already ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N not in position 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ _ E  
with N in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try “UNITE” – but T is excluded.  
Try “HUMID” – ends in D, not E.  
Try “MIDGE” – uses D and G, but D is allowed, G is allowed, but we already have E fixed at end.  
Wait, we need to test new letters while keeping E fixed and N somewhere.

A good candidate is “CHIME” – but M and I are new, H is new, C is new, but O is excluded (ok, O is excluded but we’re using I).  
But R is excluded, so CHIME uses C, H, I, M, E – all allowed.

Another candidate: “FUNKY” – ends in Y, not E.  
“DINGE” – uses D, I, N, G, E – all allowed, N in position 3.

“DINGE” seems solid:  
D – new consonant  
I – new vowel  
N – known in word, not in position 4  
G – new consonant  
E – fixed final letter

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes two vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of S, L, A, T. We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Contains none of S, L, A, T
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, O, U (since A is out)

Possible candidates:
- RINSE (but S is excluded)
- CHIME (but M and H are less common)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E - all allowed)
- DRONE (D, R, O, N, E - all allowed)

""PRONE"" seems like a good choice because it tests P, R, O, N - all common letters not yet eliminated.

Guess 2: PRONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is the final letter.  
   – S, L, A, T are completely absent.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – P, R, O are absent.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains N somewhere, but not in position 4.
- Absent letters: S, L, A, T, P, R, O.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O already ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N not in position 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ _ E  
with N in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try “UNITE” – but T is excluded.  
Try “HUMID” – ends in D, not E.  
Try “MIDGE” – uses D and G, but D is allowed, G is allowed, but we already have E fixed at end.  
Wait, we need to test new letters while keeping E fixed and N somewhere.

A good candidate is “CHIME” – but M and I are new, H is new, C is new, but O is excluded (ok, O is excluded but we’re using I).  
But R is excluded, so CHIME uses C, H, I, M, E – all allowed.

Another candidate: “FUNKY” – ends in Y, not E.  
“DINGE” – uses D, I, N, G, E – all allowed, N in position 3.

“DINGE” seems solid:  
D – new consonant  
I – new vowel  
N – known in word, not in position 4  
G – new consonant  
E – fixed final letter

Let’s go with DINGE.

Guess 3: DINGE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(x) N(-) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from PRONE and DINGE feedback).
3. Letters completely ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, P, R, O, D, I, G.

So N must be in position 1 or 2, and the word ends in E.

Pattern: _ _ _ _ E with N in position 1 or 2.

Allowed letters left (common): B, C, F, H, K, M, U, W, Y, etc.
Allowed vowels left: U (I, A, O already excluded).

We need to test a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Has N in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- N _ _ _ E: N is position 1.
- _ N _ _ E: N is position 2.

Let’s try N _ _ _ E first. Possible words:
- NERVE – uses R (excluded), V (new), E (fixed). R excluded → invalid.
- NEWER – uses W (new), E (fixed), R (excluded) → invalid.
- NUDGE – uses U (vowel), N (position 1), D (excluded) → invalid.

Try _ N _ _ E:
- HONEY – O (excluded) → invalid.
- BONEY – O (excluded) → invalid.
- MONEY – O (excluded) → invalid.
- UNITY – doesn’t end in E → invalid.

Let’s try N _ _ _ E again with remaining letters:
- NERVE – R excluded.
- NINNY – I excluded.
- NEWBE – B and W are new, but E is fixed, N is position 1.

NEWBE:
- N (position 1) – allowed.
- E (position 5) – allowed.
- W, B, E – all allowed letters.

But NEWBE is a valid word (meaning new person).

Another option: NEMBE – but M and B are new, E is fixed, N is position 1.

NEMBE:
- N (position 1) – allowed.
- E (position 5) – allowed.
- M, E, B – all allowed letters.

Between NEWBE and NEMBE, NEWBE seems more common.

Let’s go with NEWBE.
