For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These cover a good range of common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels and two common consonants (R, S), giving us broad coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word at all.

  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each exactly once) and does not contain O or S. We also want to test new consonants and possibly place the known letters in new positions.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- Contains R, E, A (all known to be in the word)
- Adds new letters C and T (unknown yet)
- Places R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 2)
- Places E in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5)
- Places A in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1)

This maximizes information gain by testing two new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on REACT:

- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: R (position 1), A, E  
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Position constraints:
  – R is locked in position 1.  
  – A cannot be in position 1 (already ruled out) or 3.  
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E exactly once each, in allowed positions.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no O, S, C, T).  
- Has two additional letters from the remaining unused alphabet.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.  
- E can be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- If A is in position 2, then E must be in 3 or 4.  
- If A is in position 4, then E must be in 3.  
- If A is in position 5, then E must be in 3 or 4.

A promising pattern is R A _ E _ or R _ A E _ or R _ _ A E (but A cannot be in 3 or E in 5).

One simple word that fits: R A I N E → but N and I are still allowed, and E would be in position 5, which is disallowed.  
Another: R A I D E → again E in 5 is disallowed.  
Try R A I S E → contains S, which is disallowed.  
Try R A I N Y → Y is allowed, but we haven’t tested N or Y yet. However, we still need to include E somewhere.

Let’s try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.  
Try R A I D E → same issue.  
Try R E A D Y → E in 2 is disallowed.  
Try R E A L M → E in 2 disallowed.  
Try R E A D Y → same.  
Try R E A L M → same.

Instead, let’s try to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have two vowels together and need two new consonants.  
- R _ A E _ → possible. For example, R I A E N → but I and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid word.  
- R _ _ A E → but E is last, disallowed.

Another approach: R A _ E _ → need a consonant in 3 and another in 5.  
Possible word: R A D E N → but D and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid English word.  
Try R A M E D → but M and D are allowed, but not a valid word.  
Try R A I N E → again E last.

Wait, let’s list valid English words starting with R, containing A and E, without O, S, C, T:
- R A I N E → invalid (E last).  
- R A I D E → invalid.  
- R A M E D → invalid.  
- R A P E D → invalid.  
- R A V E D → invalid.  
- R A G E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.  
- R A N E D → invalid.  
- R A L E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.

Hmm, maybe R E A _ _:
- R E A _ _ → E in 2 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try R _ E A _:
- R I E A N → invalid.  
- R U E A N → invalid.  
- R Y E A N → invalid.

Try R _ _ E A:
- R I V E A → invalid.  
- R U M E A → invalid.  
- R Y M E A → invalid.

Let’s try R A _ _ E → but E in 5 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Try R A _ E _:
- R A D E N → invalid.  
- R A M E N → invalid.  
- R A I E N → invalid.

Try R A _ _ E → invalid.

Try R _ A E _:
- R I A E N → invalid.  
- R U A E N → invalid.

Try R _ _ A E → invalid.

This suggests we need to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4.

Let’s try R A E _ _:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have R A E _ _, need two more letters not ruled out.  
- R A E N D → invalid.  
- R A E M D → invalid.

Try R E A _ _ → but E in 2 is disallowed.

Let me think differently: we have R fixed in position 1, and need to place A and E in remaining positions without violating constraints.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1 or 3.  
- E cannot be 2 or 5.

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4  

Let’s try:
- R A E _ _ → A in 2, E in 3. Need two more letters not ruled out (no O, S, C, T).  
  Possible: R A E N D → invalid.  
  R A E M N → invalid.  
  R A E I N → invalid.  
  R A E R Y → invalid (R repeated).  
  R A E N Y → invalid.

- R _ A E _ → A in 3 is disallowed.  
- R _ _ A E → E in 5 is disallowed.  
- R _ E A _ → possible: R I E A N → invalid.  
- R _ _ E A → possible: R I M E A → invalid.

Let me try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.

Wait, let’s try R A M E N → but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: R A V E N → but E is in 4, A in 2, N in 5. This uses R, A, E, N, V.  
Check constraints:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E.  
- No O, S, C, T.  
- A is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 4 (allowed).  
- N and V are new letters.

This seems valid. Let me check if RAVEN is a valid word: yes, it is.

So the next guess is RAVEN.

- R U A E N → invalid.

Try R _ _ A E → invalid.

This suggests we need to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4.

Let’s try R A E _ _:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have R A E _ _, need two more letters not ruled out.  
- R A E N D → invalid.  
- R A E M D → invalid.

Try R E A _ _ → but E in 2 is disallowed.

Let me think differently: we have R fixed in position 1, and need to place A and E in remaining positions without violating constraints.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1 or 3.  
- E cannot be 2 or 5.

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4  

Let’s try:
- R A E _ _ → A in 2, E in 3. Need two more letters not ruled out (no O, S, C, T).  
  Possible: R A E N D → invalid.  
  R A E M N → invalid.  
  R A E I N → invalid.  
  R A E R Y → invalid (R repeated).  
  R A E N Y → invalid.

- R _ A E _ → A in 3 is disallowed.  
- R _ _ A E → E in 5 is disallowed.  
- R _ E A _ → possible: R I E A N → invalid.  
- R _ _ E A → possible: R I M E A → invalid.

Let me try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.

Wait, let’s try R A M E N → but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: R A V E N → but E is in 4, A in 2, N in 5. This uses R, A, E, N, V.  
Check constraints:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E.  
- No O, S, C, T.  
- A is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 4 (allowed).  
- N and V are new letters.

This seems valid. Let me check if RAVEN is a valid word: yes, it is.

So the next guess is RAVEN.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These cover a good range of common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels and two common consonants (R, S), giving us broad coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, E
- Letters not in the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – R cannot be in position 2
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each exactly once) and does not contain O or S. We also want to test new consonants and possibly place the known letters in new positions.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- Contains R, E, A (all known to be in the word)
- Adds new letters C and T (unknown yet)
- Places R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 2)
- Places E in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5)
- Places A in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1)

This maximizes information gain by testing two new letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on REACT:

- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: R (position 1), A, E  
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Position constraints:
  – R is locked in position 1.  
  – A cannot be in position 1 (already ruled out) or 3.  
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E exactly once each, in allowed positions.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no O, S, C, T).  
- Has two additional letters from the remaining unused alphabet.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.  
- E can be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- If A is in position 2, then E must be in 3 or 4.  
- If A is in position 4, then E must be in 3.  
- If A is in position 5, then E must be in 3 or 4.

A promising pattern is R A _ E _ or R _ A E _ or R _ _ A E (but A cannot be in 3 or E in 5).

One simple word that fits: R A I N E → but N and I are still allowed, and E would be in position 5, which is disallowed.  
Another: R A I D E → again E in 5 is disallowed.  
Try R A I S E → contains S, which is disallowed.  
Try R A I N Y → Y is allowed, but we haven’t tested N or Y yet. However, we still need to include E somewhere.

Let’s try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.  
Try R A I D E → same issue.  
Try R E A D Y → E in 2 is disallowed.  
Try R E A L M → E in 2 disallowed.  
Try R E A D Y → same.  
Try R E A L M → same.

Instead, let’s try to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have two vowels together and need two new consonants.  
- R _ A E _ → possible. For example, R I A E N → but I and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid word.  
- R _ _ A E → but E is last, disallowed.

Another approach: R A _ E _ → need a consonant in 3 and another in 5.  
Possible word: R A D E N → but D and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid English word.  
Try R A M E D → but M and D are allowed, but not a valid word.  
Try R A I N E → again E last.

Wait, let’s list valid English words starting with R, containing A and E, without O, S, C, T:
- R A I N E → invalid (E last).  
- R A I D E → invalid.  
- R A M E D → invalid.  
- R A P E D → invalid.  
- R A V E D → invalid.  
- R A G E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.  
- R A N E D → invalid.  
- R A L E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.

Hmm, maybe R E A _ _:
- R E A _ _ → E in 2 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try R _ E A _:
- R I E A N → invalid.  
- R U E A N → invalid.  
- R Y E A N → invalid.

Try R _ _ E A:
- R I V E A → invalid.  
- R U M E A → invalid.  
- R Y M E A → invalid.

Let’s try R A _ _ E → but E in 5 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Try R A _ E _:
- R A D E N → invalid.  
- R A M E N → invalid.  
- R A I E N → invalid.

Try R A _ _ E → invalid.

Try R _ A E _:
- R I A E N → invalid.  
- R U A E N → invalid.

Try R _ _ A E → invalid.

This suggests we need to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4.

Let’s try R A E _ _:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have R A E _ _, need two more letters not ruled out.  
- R A E N D → invalid.  
- R A E M D → invalid.

Try R E A _ _ → but E in 2 is disallowed.

Let me think differently: we have R fixed in position 1, and need to place A and E in remaining positions without violating constraints.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1 or 3.  
- E cannot be 2 or 5.

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4  

Let’s try:
- R A E _ _ → A in 2, E in 3. Need two more letters not ruled out (no O, S, C, T).  
  Possible: R A E N D → invalid.  
  R A E M N → invalid.  
  R A E I N → invalid.  
  R A E R Y → invalid (R repeated).  
  R A E N Y → invalid.

- R _ A E _ → A in 3 is disallowed.  
- R _ _ A E → E in 5 is disallowed.  
- R _ E A _ → possible: R I E A N → invalid.  
- R _ _ E A → possible: R I M E A → invalid.

Let me try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.

Wait, let’s try R A M E N → but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: R A V E N → but E is in 4, A in 2, N in 5. This uses R, A, E, N, V.  
Check constraints:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E.  
- No O, S, C, T.  
- A is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 4 (allowed).  
- N and V are new letters.

This seems valid. Let me check if RAVEN is a valid word: yes, it is.

Current knowledge:

Remaining consonants that could fit: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to maximize information. Let’s try a consonant pair that hasn’t been tested yet and forms a valid word.

Possible candidates:
- R A B E R → but R is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat.
- R A D E M → not a valid word.
- R A G E D → valid word, uses D and G (both new).

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, E
- Letters not in the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – R cannot be in position 2
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each exactly once) and does not contain O or S. We also want to test new consonants and possibly place the known letters in new positions.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- Contains R, E, A (all known to be in the word)
- Adds new letters C and T (unknown yet)
- Places R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 2)
- Places E in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5)
- Places A in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1)

This maximizes information gain by testing two new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on REACT:

- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: R (position 1), A, E  
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Position constraints:
  – R is locked in position 1.  
  – A cannot be in position 1 (already ruled out) or 3.  
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E exactly once each, in allowed positions.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no O, S, C, T).  
- Has two additional letters from the remaining unused alphabet.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.  
- E can be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- If A is in position 2, then E must be in 3 or 4.  
- If A is in position 4, then E must be in 3.  
- If A is in position 5, then E must be in 3 or 4.

A promising pattern is R A _ E _ or R _ A E _ or R _ _ A E (but A cannot be in 3 or E in 5).

One simple word that fits: R A I N E → but N and I are still allowed, and E would be in position 5, which is disallowed.  
Another: R A I D E → again E in 5 is disallowed.  
Try R A I S E → contains S, which is disallowed.  
Try R A I N Y → Y is allowed, but we haven’t tested N or Y yet. However, we still need to include E somewhere.

Let’s try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.  
Try R A I D E → same issue.  
Try R E A D Y → E in 2 is disallowed.  
Try R E A L M → E in 2 disallowed.  
Try R E A D Y → same.  
Try R E A L M → same.

Instead, let’s try to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have two vowels together and need two new consonants.  
- R _ A E _ → possible. For example, R I A E N → but I and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid word.  
- R _ _ A E → but E is last, disallowed.

Another approach: R A _ E _ → need a consonant in 3 and another in 5.  
Possible word: R A D E N → but D and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid English word.  
Try R A M E D → but M and D are allowed, but not a valid word.  
Try R A I N E → again E last.

Wait, let’s list valid English words starting with R, containing A and E, without O, S, C, T:
- R A I N E → invalid (E last).  
- R A I D E → invalid.  
- R A M E D → invalid.  
- R A P E D → invalid.  
- R A V E D → invalid.  
- R A G E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.  
- R A N E D → invalid.  
- R A L E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.

Hmm, maybe R E A _ _:
- R E A _ _ → E in 2 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try R _ E A _:
- R I E A N → invalid.  
- R U E A N → invalid.  
- R Y E A N → invalid.

Try R _ _ E A:
- R I V E A → invalid.  
- R U M E A → invalid.  
- R Y M E A → invalid.

Let’s try R A _ _ E → but E in 5 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Try R A _ E _:
- R A D E N → invalid.  
- R A M E N → invalid.  
- R A I E N → invalid.

Try R A _ _ E → invalid.

Try R _ A E _:
- R I A E N → invalid.  
- R U A E N → invalid.

Try R _ _ A E → invalid.

This suggests we need to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4.

Let’s try R A E _ _:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have R A E _ _, need two more letters not ruled out.  
- R A E N D → invalid.  
- R A E M D → invalid.

Try R E A _ _ → but E in 2 is disallowed.

Let me think differently: we have R fixed in position 1, and need to place A and E in remaining positions without violating constraints.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1 or 3.  
- E cannot be 2 or 5.

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4  

Let’s try:
- R A E _ _ → A in 2, E in 3. Need two more letters not ruled out (no O, S, C, T).  
  Possible: R A E N D → invalid.  
  R A E M N → invalid.  
  R A E I N → invalid.  
  R A E R Y → invalid (R repeated).  
  R A E N Y → invalid.

- R _ A E _ → A in 3 is disallowed.  
- R _ _ A E → E in 5 is disallowed.  
- R _ E A _ → possible: R I E A N → invalid.  
- R _ _ E A → possible: R I M E A → invalid.

Let me try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.

Wait, let’s try R A M E N → but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: R A V E N → but E is in 4, A in 2, N in 5. This uses R, A, E, N, V.  
Check constraints:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E.  
- No O, S, C, T.  
- A is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 4 (allowed).  
- N and V are new letters.

This seems valid. Let me check if RAVEN is a valid word: yes, it is.

So the next guess is RAVEN.

Current knowledge:
- R is locked in position 1.
- A is locked in position 2.
- E is locked in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, V, N.

So the word has the form: R A _ E _

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) that are not among O, S, C, T, V, N.

Remaining consonants that could fit: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to maximize information. Let’s try a consonant pair that hasn’t been tested yet and forms a valid word.

Possible candidates:
- R A B E R → but R is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat.
- R A D E M → not a valid word.
- R A G E D → valid word, uses D and G (both new).
- R A H E D → not common.
- R A M E D → valid word, uses D and M.
- R A P E D → valid word, uses D and P.

Among these, “RAGED” and “RAPED” are both good, but “RAGED” tests G (a bit less common) vs. P (common). Let’s pick “RAPED”.

Check constraints:
- R A P E D → positions: R(1) A(2) P(3) E(4) D(5)
- All letters are allowed (no O, S, C, T, V, N).
- No repeats of R, A, E.

“RAPED” is a valid English word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular starting words are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". These cover a good range of common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels and two common consonants (R, S), giving us broad coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- Letters in the word: A, R, E
- Letters not in the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – R cannot be in position 2
  – E cannot be in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each exactly once) and does not contain O or S. We also want to test new consonants and possibly place the known letters in new positions.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- Contains R, E, A (all known to be in the word)
- Adds new letters C and T (unknown yet)
- Places R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 2)
- Places E in position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5)
- Places A in position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1)

This maximizes information gain by testing two new letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on REACT:

- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: R (position 1), A, E  
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Position constraints:
  – R is locked in position 1.  
  – A cannot be in position 1 (already ruled out) or 3.  
  – E cannot be in position 2 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E exactly once each, in allowed positions.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no O, S, C, T).  
- Has two additional letters from the remaining unused alphabet.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.  
- E can be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- If A is in position 2, then E must be in 3 or 4.  
- If A is in position 4, then E must be in 3.  
- If A is in position 5, then E must be in 3 or 4.

A promising pattern is R A _ E _ or R _ A E _ or R _ _ A E (but A cannot be in 3 or E in 5).

One simple word that fits: R A I N E → but N and I are still allowed, and E would be in position 5, which is disallowed.  
Another: R A I D E → again E in 5 is disallowed.  
Try R A I S E → contains S, which is disallowed.  
Try R A I N Y → Y is allowed, but we haven’t tested N or Y yet. However, we still need to include E somewhere.

Let’s try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.  
Try R A I D E → same issue.  
Try R E A D Y → E in 2 is disallowed.  
Try R E A L M → E in 2 disallowed.  
Try R E A D Y → same.  
Try R E A L M → same.

Instead, let’s try to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have two vowels together and need two new consonants.  
- R _ A E _ → possible. For example, R I A E N → but I and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid word.  
- R _ _ A E → but E is last, disallowed.

Another approach: R A _ E _ → need a consonant in 3 and another in 5.  
Possible word: R A D E N → but D and N are allowed, but this isn’t a valid English word.  
Try R A M E D → but M and D are allowed, but not a valid word.  
Try R A I N E → again E last.

Wait, let’s list valid English words starting with R, containing A and E, without O, S, C, T:
- R A I N E → invalid (E last).  
- R A I D E → invalid.  
- R A M E D → invalid.  
- R A P E D → invalid.  
- R A V E D → invalid.  
- R A G E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.  
- R A N E D → invalid.  
- R A L E D → invalid.  
- R A B E D → invalid.

Hmm, maybe R E A _ _:
- R E A _ _ → E in 2 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try R _ E A _:
- R I E A N → invalid.  
- R U E A N → invalid.  
- R Y E A N → invalid.

Try R _ _ E A:
- R I V E A → invalid.  
- R U M E A → invalid.  
- R Y M E A → invalid.

Let’s try R A _ _ E → but E in 5 is disallowed.  
So E must be in 3 or 4.

Try R A _ E _:
- R A D E N → invalid.  
- R A M E N → invalid.  
- R A I E N → invalid.

Try R A _ _ E → invalid.

Try R _ A E _:
- R I A E N → invalid.  
- R U A E N → invalid.

Try R _ _ A E → invalid.

This suggests we need to place E in 3 and A in 2 or 4.

Let’s try R A E _ _:
- R A E _ _ → but then we have R A E _ _, need two more letters not ruled out.  
- R A E N D → invalid.  
- R A E M D → invalid.

Try R E A _ _ → but E in 2 is disallowed.

Let me think differently: we have R fixed in position 1, and need to place A and E in remaining positions without violating constraints.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be 1 or 3.  
- E cannot be 2 or 5.

So possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 3, 4  

Let’s try:
- R A E _ _ → A in 2, E in 3. Need two more letters not ruled out (no O, S, C, T).  
  Possible: R A E N D → invalid.  
  R A E M N → invalid.  
  R A E I N → invalid.  
  R A E R Y → invalid (R repeated).  
  R A E N Y → invalid.

- R _ A E _ → A in 3 is disallowed.  
- R _ _ A E → E in 5 is disallowed.  
- R _ E A _ → possible: R I E A N → invalid.  
- R _ _ E A → possible: R I M E A → invalid.

Let me try R A I N E → but E is last, disallowed.

Wait, let’s try R A M E N → but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: R A V E N → but E is in 4, A in 2, N in 5. This uses R, A, E, N, V.  
Check constraints:
- Starts with R.  
- Contains A and E.  
- No O, S, C, T.  
- A is in 2 (allowed).  
- E is in 4 (allowed).  
- N and V are new letters.

This seems valid. Let me check if RAVEN is a valid word: yes, it is.

So the next guess is RAVEN.

Current knowledge:
- R is locked in position 1.
- A is locked in position 2.
- E is locked in position 4.
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, V, N.

So the word has the form: R A _ E _

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) that are not among O, S, C, T, V, N.

Remaining consonants that could fit: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common letters to maximize information. Let’s try a consonant pair that hasn’t been tested yet and forms a valid word.

Possible candidates:
- R A B E R → but R is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat.
- R A D E M → not a valid word.
- R A G E D → valid word, uses D and G (both new).
- R A H E D → not common.
- R A M E D → valid word, uses D and M.
- R A P E D → valid word, uses D and P.

Among these, “RAGED” and “RAPED” are both good, but “RAGED” tests G (a bit less common) vs. P (common). Let’s pick “RAPED”.

Check constraints:
- R A P E D → positions: R(1) A(2) P(3) E(4) D(5)
- All letters are allowed (no O, S, C, T, V, N).
- No repeats of R, A, E.

“RAPED” is a valid English word.

From the latest feedback:

- R(✓) A(✓) P(x) E(✓) D(✓)

We now know:
1. The word is R A _ E D (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are fixed).
2. The missing letter (position 3) is NOT P.
3. We have already ruled out: O, S, C, T, V, N, P.
4. Remaining consonants that can fill position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit R A _ E D:
- R A B E D → ""RABED"" (valid, but uncommon)
- R A F E D → ""RAFED"" (not a standard word)
- R A G E D → ""RAGED"" (valid)
- R A H E D → ""RAHED"" (not a word)
- R A K E D → ""RAKED"" (valid)
- R A L E D → ""RALED"" (valid, but rare)
- R A M E D → ""RAMED"" (valid)

Among these, ""RAGED"", ""RAKED"", and ""RAMED"" are all valid. ""RAGED"" tests G, ""RAKED"" tests K, ""RAMED"" tests M. Since we have only one slot left, any of these could be correct, but we need to choose one to test. ""RAGED"" seems a good choice as G is a common consonant.

However, looking back at the feedback history, we have not tested G yet. Let's go with ""RAGED"".The pattern is now R A _ E D, and we have not yet tested G in position 3.
