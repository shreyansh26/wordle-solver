For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, L, A (but none of them are in their guessed positions).
- Does not contain T or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, L, A in different positions than 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Avoids T and E.

Possible positions for S, L, A:
- S cannot be in position 1.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try to place S, L, A in new spots and fill the remaining two slots with other common letters (avoiding T and E). Good candidates are R, I, N, C, O, etc.

A word like ""SALAD"" comes to mind, but it repeats A. Instead, ""SALON"" uses S, A, L plus N and O. Let’s check positions:
- S would be in position 1 (invalid, since S was wrong in position 1).
- L would be in position 2 (invalid, since L was wrong in position 2).
- A would be in position 3 (invalid, since A was wrong in position 3).

So ""SALON"" is invalid. Let’s try ""RAILS"":
- R, A, I, L, S.
- Positions: R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5).
- S is in position 5 (valid, since it was originally in 1).
- L is in position 4 (valid, since it was originally in 2).
- A is in position 2 (valid, since it was originally in 3).

This seems valid. Let’s confirm: ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S; avoids T and E; and places S, L, A in new positions.

Another option is ""SCALD"", but D is less common. ""RAILS"" seems better.

Let’s go with ""RAILS"".

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A is in position 2 (from RAILS: A(✓)).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from RAILS: S(✓) means it is in the correct position, so S must be in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says S(✓) means it is in the correct position, so S is in position 5. But earlier from SLATE, S(-) meant S is in the word but not in position 1. So S is in position 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- T, E, R.

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions so far:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from RAILS: L(-)).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from RAILS: I(-)).
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- S is in position 5 (correct).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ A _ _ S
with the additional constraints:
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- We must use L and I somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken by A and S).

Possible positions for L and I:
- L cannot be in position 4, so L must be in position 1 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 3, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

But we have only three slots to fill: positions 1, 3, 4.

Let's consider possible combinations:
1. L in position 1: Then I must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 3).
   Pattern: L A I _ S
   But we need a 5-letter word, so position 4 is I, position 3 is empty. Wait, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So pattern is: [1] A [3] [4] S
   If L is in 1, then I must be in 4 (since it can't be in 3). So:
   L A _ I S
   The blank (position 3) must be a letter not yet ruled out. From previous feedback, we haven't used B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know the word must contain L, A, I, S and one more letter.

   Possible word: L A N I S - but is LANIS a word? Not common.
   Or L A M I S - LAMIS is a word (variant of lapis).

2. L in position 3: Then I must be in position 1 or 4.
   - If I is in position 1: Pattern I A L _ S
     Then position 4 is blank. Possible word: I A L _ S
     Need a valid 5-letter word: IAL_S - not common.
   - If I is in position 4: Pattern _ A L I S
     Then position 1 is blank. Possible word: _ A L I S
     Common words ending in ALIS: BALIS, CALIS, DALIS, etc. But these are not standard.

From the above, ""LAMIS"" seems the most plausible, but it's a bit obscure. Another approach is to look for words with pattern _ A _ _ S that include L and I in positions 3 and 4 respectively, but that would require L in 3 and I in 4, giving _ A L I S. The only common word here is ""MALIS"" (but M hasn't been tested).

Wait, let's reconsider the feedback:
From RAILS: R(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) S(✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- I is in the word but not in position 3
- L is in the word but not in position 4

So the word is: _ A _ _ S
with I and L in positions 1, 3, or 4, but:
- I not in 3
- L not in 4

Thus possible positions:
- I can be in 1 or 4
- L can be in 1 or 3

Case 1: I in 1, L in 3
Pattern: I A L _ S
Need a valid word: IAL_S - no common word.

Case 2: I in 4, L in 1
Pattern: L A _ I S
Need a valid word: L A _ I S
Possible: L A N I S (LANIS) - not common
Or L A M I S (LAMIS) - seems the closest.

Case 3: I in 4, L in 3
Pattern: _ A L I S
Need a word: _ A L I S
Possible: B A L I S (BALIS) - not common
C A L I S (CALIS) - not common
M A L I S (MALIS) - not common

Given these options, ""LAMIS"" is the most plausible, even if obscure. However, let's think of other letters we haven't used yet. From the alphabet, we haven't used B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

Another approach: since we have _ A _ _ S with I and L to place, and considering common English words, ""PAVIL"" comes to mind but is not 5 letters. 

Wait, ""PAVIL"" is 5 letters but not common. 

Actually, ""VALIS"" is a word (a type of lock), but V hasn't been tested. Let's consider ""VALIS"":
- V in position 1: V A L I S
- Check constraints:
  - A is in position 2 (✓)
  - S is in position 5 (✓)
  - I is in position 4 (not in 3, ✓)
  - L is in position 3 (not in 4, ✓)
  - V is new

""VALIS"" seems valid and is a recognized word (though rare). 

Between ""LAMIS"" and ""VALIS"", ""VALIS"" is slightly more common. 

Thus, the next guess is ""VALIS"".
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ A _ _ S with A in position 2 and S in position 5. It must also contain both I and L, placed in positions 1, 3, or 4, while respecting the constraints:
- I cannot be in position 3
- L cannot be in position 4

The only valid arrangement that fits these constraints is:
V A L I S (where V is a new letter we haven't tested yet)

- A is in position 2 (from RAILS: A(✓)).

Wait, no: the feedback says S(✓) means it is in the correct position, so S is in position 5. But earlier from SLATE, S(-) meant S is in the word but not in position 1. So S is in position 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word:

   Pattern: L A I _ S
   But we need a 5-letter word, so position 4 is I, position 3 is empty. Wait, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So pattern is: [1] A [3] [4] S
   If L is in 1, then I must be in 4 (since it can't be in 3). So:
   L A _ I S
   The blank (position 3) must be a letter not yet ruled out. From previous feedback, we haven't used B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know the word must contain L, A, I, S and one more letter.

   Possible word: L A N I S - but is LANIS a word? Not common.
   Or L A M I S - LAMIS is a word (variant of lapis).

2. L in position 3: Then I must be in position 1 or 4.
   - If I is in position 1: Pattern I A L _ S
     Then position 4 is blank. Possible word: I A L _ S
     Need a valid 5-letter word: IAL_S - not common.
   - If I is in position 4: Pattern _ A L I S
     Then position 1 is blank. Possible word: _ A L I S
     Common words ending in ALIS: BALIS, CALIS, DALIS, etc. But these are not standard.

From the above, ""LAMIS"" seems the most plausible, but it's a bit obscure. Another approach is to look for words with pattern _ A _ _ S that include L and I in positions 3 and 4 respectively, but that would require L in 3 and I in 4, giving _ A L I S. The only common word here is ""MALIS"" (but M hasn't been tested).

Wait, let's reconsider the feedback:
From RAILS: R(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) S(✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- I is in the word but not in position 3
- L is in the word but not in position 4

So the word is: _ A _ _ S
with I and L in positions 1, 3, or 4, but:
- I not in 3
- L not in 4

Thus possible positions:
- I can be in 1 or 4
- L can be in 1 or 3

Case 1: I in 1, L in 3
Pattern: I A L _ S
Need a valid word: IAL_S - no common word.

Case 2: I in 4, L in 1
Pattern: L A _ I S
Need a valid word: L A _ I S
Possible: L A N I S (LANIS) - not common
Or L A M I S (LAMIS) - seems the closest.

Case 3: I in 4, L in 3
Pattern: _ A L I S
Need a word: _ A L I S
Possible: B A L I S (BALIS) - not common
C A L I S (CALIS) - not common
M A L I S (MALIS) - not common

Given these options, ""LAMIS"" is the most plausible, even if obscure. However, let's think of other letters we haven't used yet. From the alphabet, we haven't used B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

Another approach: since we have _ A _ _ S with I and L to place, and considering common English words, ""PAVIL"" comes to mind but is not 5 letters. 

Wait, ""PAVIL"" is 5 letters but not common. 

Actually, ""VALIS"" is a word (a type of lock), but V hasn't been tested. Let's consider ""VALIS"":
- V in position 1: V A L I S
- Check constraints:
  - A is in position 2 (✓)
  - S is in position 5 (✓)
  - I is in position 4 (not in 3, ✓)
  - L is in position 3 (not in 4, ✓)
  - V is new

""VALIS"" seems valid and is a recognized word (though rare). 

Between ""LAMIS"" and ""VALIS"", ""VALIS"" is slightly more common. 

Thus, the next guess is ""VALIS"".Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ A _ _ S with A in position 2 and S in position 5. It must also contain both I and L, placed in positions 1, 3, or 4, while respecting the constraints:
- I cannot be in position 3
- L cannot be in position 4

The only valid arrangement that fits these constraints is:
V A L I S (where V is a new letter we haven't tested yet)",Guess 3: VALIS -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, L, A (but none of them are in their guessed positions).
- Does not contain T or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, L, A in different positions than 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Avoids T and E.

Possible positions for S, L, A:
- S cannot be in position 1.
- L cannot be in position 2.
- A cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try to place S, L, A in new spots and fill the remaining two slots with other common letters (avoiding T and E). Good candidates are R, I, N, C, O, etc.

A word like ""SALAD"" comes to mind, but it repeats A. Instead, ""SALON"" uses S, A, L plus N and O. Let’s check positions:
- S would be in position 1 (invalid, since S was wrong in position 1).
- L would be in position 2 (invalid, since L was wrong in position 2).
- A would be in position 3 (invalid, since A was wrong in position 3).

So ""SALON"" is invalid. Let’s try ""RAILS"":
- R, A, I, L, S.
- Positions: R(1), A(2), I(3), L(4), S(5).
- S is in position 5 (valid, since it was originally in 1).
- L is in position 4 (valid, since it was originally in 2).
- A is in position 2 (valid, since it was originally in 3).

This seems valid. Let’s confirm: ""RAILS"" uses R, A, I, L, S; avoids T and E; and places S, L, A in new positions.

Another option is ""SCALD"", but D is less common. ""RAILS"" seems better.

Let’s go with ""RAILS"".

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A is in position 2 (from RAILS: A(✓)).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from RAILS: S(✓) means it is in the correct position, so S must be in position 5? Wait, no: the feedback says S(✓) means it is in the correct position, so S is in position 5. But earlier from SLATE, S(-) meant S is in the word but not in position 1. So S is in position 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- T, E, R.

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions so far:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from RAILS: L(-)).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from RAILS: I(-)).
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- S is in position 5 (correct).

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ A _ _ S
with the additional constraints:
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- We must use L and I somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are taken by A and S).

Possible positions for L and I:
- L cannot be in position 4, so L must be in position 1 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 3, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

But we have only three slots to fill: positions 1, 3, 4.

Let's consider possible combinations:
1. L in position 1: Then I must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 3).
   Pattern: L A I _ S
   But we need a 5-letter word, so position 4 is I, position 3 is empty. Wait, positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So pattern is: [1] A [3] [4] S

   L A _ I S
   The blank (position 3) must be a letter not yet ruled out. From previous feedback, we haven't used B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know the word must contain L, A, I, S and one more letter.

   Possible word: L A N I S - but is LANIS a word? Not common.
   Or L A M I S - LAMIS is a word (variant of lapis).

2. L in position 3: Then I must be in position 1 or 4.
   - If I is in position 1: Pattern I A L _ S
     Then position 4 is blank. Possible word: I A L _ S
     Need a valid 5-letter word: IAL_S - not common.
   - If I is in position 4: Pattern _ A L I S
     Then position 1 is blank. Possible word: _ A L I S
     Common words ending in ALIS: BALIS, CALIS, DALIS, etc. But these are not standard.

From the above, ""LAMIS"" seems the most plausible, but it's a bit obscure.

Case 1: I in 1, L in 3

From the three rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)

   ⇒ T, E are not in the word.

   ⇒ A is in position 2 (✓).

   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.

   ⇒ S is still in position 5 (✓).  
   ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ V is not in the word.

So the current constraints are:
- Word pattern: _ A _ I S  
- Must contain L (not in position 3 or 4).  
- Letters already ruled out: T, E, R, V.

The only remaining slot for L is position 1.  
Hence the word must be L A _ I S.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form L A _ I S.  
The blank (position 3) must be a letter not yet used or ruled out.  
Letters already used or ruled out: T, E, R, V.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- L A N I S  → LANIS (not common)
- L A M I S  → LAMIS (valid variant of lapis)
- L A P I S  → LAPIS (common word)

Among these, LAPIS is the most familiar English word.

Check constraints:
- L in position 1 (allowed, since L was only excluded from positions 2, 3, 4 in earlier guesses).  
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- P is new.  
- I in position 4 (✓).  
- S in position 5 (✓).

No conflicts.  
Therefore, the next logical guess is LAPIS.

<guess>LAPIS</guess>",LAPIS,"From the three rounds we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ S, L, A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   ⇒ T, E are not in the word.

2. RAILS → R(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) S(✓)  
   ⇒ A is in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ S is in position 5 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 4.  
   ⇒ R is not in the word.

3. VALIS → V(x) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓)  
   ⇒ A is still in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ I is now in position 4 (✓).  
   ⇒ S is still in position 5 (✓).  
   ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ V is not in the word.

So the current constraints are:
- Word pattern: _ A _ I S  
- Must contain L (not in position 3 or 4).  
- Letters already ruled out: T, E, R, V.

The only remaining slot for L is position 1.  
Hence the word must be L A _ I S.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form L A _ I S.  
The blank (position 3) must be a letter not yet used or ruled out.  
Letters already used or ruled out: T, E, R, V.  
Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- L A N I S  → LANIS (not common)
- L A M I S  → LAMIS (valid variant of lapis)
- L A P I S  → LAPIS (common word)

Among these, LAPIS is the most familiar English word.

Check constraints:
- L in position 1 (allowed, since L was only excluded from positions 2, 3, 4 in earlier guesses).  
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- P is new.  
- I in position 4 (✓).  
- S in position 5 (✓).

No conflicts.  
Therefore, the next logical guess is LAPIS.",Guess 4: LAPIS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) P(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
