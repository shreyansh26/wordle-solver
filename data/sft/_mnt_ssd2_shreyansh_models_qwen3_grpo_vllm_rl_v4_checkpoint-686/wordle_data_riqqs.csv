- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place. Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice.

From the new feedback on FIRST:

- S: still in the word but wrong position (-) – previously it was 4th, now it’s 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, or 5th. But 2nd is already taken by I, so 1st or 5th.
- T: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), R, S
- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- S cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But 2nd is I, so 1 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Contains R and S in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, E, F, T).

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- I: correct position 2
- S: could be 3rd (but 3rd is allowed for S since it wasn’t tested there before)

Let’s try “R” in 1st, “S” in 5th: “R I _ _ S” – but I is 2nd, so “_ I _ _ _” with R and S elsewhere.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place. Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice.

- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- S cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But 2nd is I, so 1 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Contains R and S in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, E, F, T).

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ _ with R and S in 1, 4, or 5, and no repeats.

Let’s try “WISPS”:
- W: new letter
- I: correct position 2
- S: could be 3rd (but 3rd is allowed for S since it wasn’t tested there before)
- P: new letter
- S: could be 5th

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 5th is allowed. However, we don’t know if S is 1st, 5th, etc. Another approach: place R and S in new positions.

Better candidate: “DRIPS”
- D: new letter
- R: 2nd position – but I is already 2nd, so no.
Wait, I must be 2nd.

Let’s try “R” in 1st, “S” in 5th: “R I _ _ S” – but I is 2nd, so “_ I _ _ _” with R and S elsewhere.

Try “CHIRS” – but C, H, I, R, S. I is 3rd here, must be 2nd.

Correct pattern: _ I _ _ _

Let’s pick “R” in 4th and “S” in 1st: S I _ R _
But we need 5 letters.

Try “S I N G R” – no, 5 letters only.

Better: “D I S C R” – no, C and R.

Wait, simpler: “R I S E N” – but E is out.

“R I S K Y” – Y is ok, but K is ok.

But R cannot be 3rd (from FIRST), so 1,4,5.

Let’s try “R I S K Y”:
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (correct)
- S: 3rd (allowed, since it was 4th and 3rd before, now 3rd is new)
- K: new
- Y: new

This tests R in 1st, S in 3rd, and introduces K and Y.

<guess>DRIPS</guess> – no, R is 2nd, I is 3rd, must have I 2nd.

Correct: “R I S K Y” – but R is 1st, I 2nd, S 3rd, K 4th, Y 5th.

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 3rd is new, allowed.

Let's parse the new feedback on DRIPS:

D (x) – not in the word  
R (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in FIRST, 3rd in DRIPS)  
I (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in DRIPS)  
P (x) – not in the word  
S (✓) – in the word and in the correct 5th position  

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T, D, P
- Letters in the word: I, R, S
- S is fixed in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from DRIPS) and not in position 2 (from FIRST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But 5 is taken by S, so R must be in 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- If I is in position 1: I _ _ _ S
- If I is in position 4: _ _ _ I S
- R must fit into the remaining spots.

Also, remaining allowed letters (excluding known absent ones): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's explore the I _ _ _ S pattern first:
I _ _ _ S
R must be in position 3 or 4 (but 4 is open if I is 1st). But R can't be 3rd (from FIRST), so R would have to be 4th. Then we have:
I _ _ R S

We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Common combinations: 
- C and H: I C H R S (ICHRS – not a word)
- B and R: but R is used.
- L and N: I L N R S (ILNRS – not a word)
- M and B: I M B R S (IMBRS – not a word)

Hmm, not finding valid words here. Let's try the other pattern where I is in position 4:
_ _ _ I S
R must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for R). Let's try:
R _ _ I S
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Possible valid words:
- R U N I S (RUNIS – not a word)
- R A I N S – but A is out
- R I V I S – no
- R O N I S – O is out
- R U B I S – no
- R U L I S – no
- R U N I S – no
- R U M I S – no
- R U C I S – no
- R U L I S – no

Wait, let's try C in position 2:
_ C _ I S
R must be 1st or 3rd. 3rd is excluded for R, so 1st:
R C _ I S
Need a consonant for position 3: R C B I S (RCBIS – no), R C H I S (RCHIS – no), R C L I S (RCLIS – no), R C M I S (RCMIS – no), R C N I S (RCNIS – no), R C U I S (RCUIS – no).

Not working. Let's try B in position 2:
_ B _ I S
R must be 1st: R B _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R B L I S (RBLIS – no), R B N I S (RBNIS – no), R B C I S (RBCIS – no), R B U I S (RBUIS – no).

Hmm. Let's try G in position 2:
_ G _ I S
R must be 1st: R G _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R G N I S (RGNIS – no), R G U I S (RGUIS – no).

This seems tough. Maybe I should try the pattern with R in position 4:
_ _ _ R S
I must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for I). Let's try:
I _ _ R S
Need consonants for 2 and 3: I C H R S (ICHRS – no), I N K R S (INKRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no), I M B R S (IMBRS – no), I L B R S (ILBRS – no), I L N R S (ILNRS – no), I L U R S (ILURS – no), I L V R S (ILVRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no).

Wait, let's try ""H"" in position 2:
_ H _ R S
I must be 1st: I H _ R S
Need consonant for 3rd: I H N R S (IHNRS – no), I H K R S (IHKRS – no), I H L R S (IHLRS – no), I H M R S (IHMRS – no), I H U R S (IHURS – no), I H V R S (IHVRS – no).

This isn't working. Let me re-examine possible words ending in ""IS"" with R somewhere.

Wait, what about ""R I S"" in different positions? We know S is 5th, so:
Possible words: _ _ _ _ S with R and I placed correctly.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending in S with I and R:
- R I S K S – but K is ok, but S is already 5th, so this would be R I S K S – but that has S in 4th and 5th, which might be allowed.
But let's check: R I S K S
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (but I cannot be 2nd from FIRST feedback where I was 2nd and marked ✓ in position 2, but in FIRST I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I must be 2nd. Wait, no: in FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is definitely 2nd. So the word must be _ I _ _ S.

Ah! I was wrong earlier. In FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is 2nd. So the word is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 or 5). From DRIPS, R was 2nd (but 2nd is I), so R must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
But from DRIPS, R was 2nd (but that's I's spot), so R is not 2nd. So R can be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Also, from DRIPS, I was 3rd (but I is actually 2nd), so that's consistent.

So the pattern is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
Possible words:
- R I _ _ S: but R can't be 2nd (it's 1st here), so possible:
  R I _ _ S: need 3rd and 4th letters. Possible: R I V E S – but E is out.
  R I N G S – G is ok, but we have no info on G.
  R I S K S – but S is 5th, so 3rd S would duplicate S.
  R I D G S – D is out.
  R I C H S – C and H are ok, but is RICH S a word? No.

- _ I R _ S: R in 3rd
  Possible: B I R K S – B, K ok
  C I R C S – no
  D I R T S – D and T out
  F I R E S – F and E out
  G I R L S – G, L ok
  H I R L S – H, L ok
  M I R K S – M, K ok
  N I R V S – N, V ok
  P I R C S – P out
  S I R R S – S out
  W I R E S – W, E out
  Y I R L S – Y, L ok

  Possible: B I N R S – no
  C I N R S – no
  G I V R S – no
  H I N R S – no
  M I N R S – no
  N I C R S – no
  V I N R S – no
  W I N R S – no
  Y I N R S – no

From these, the most promising are:
- B I R K S
- C I R C S – no
- G I R L S
- H I R L S
- M I R K S
- N I R V S
- Y I R L S

Looking at these, ""BIRKS"" is a valid word (though uncommon), ""GIRLS"" is common but uses G, I, R, L, S. Let's check:
G I R L S:
- G: new
- I: 2nd (correct)
- R: 3rd (allowed)
- L: new
- S: 5th (correct)

This seems valid and uses allowed letters.

Another good one is ""MIRKS"" – but ""mirks"" is archaic.

""GIRLS"" seems the best choice.

Based on the feedback so far:
- S is locked in position 5.
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by FIRST feedback).
- R must appear somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS), so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters A, O, E, F, T, D, P are out.

The pattern is: _ I _ _ S with R in 1 or 4.

Testing ""GIRLS"":
- G: new letter
- I: position 2 (✓)

Need valid 5-letter words starting with RI and ending with IS:

<guess>GIRLS</guess>Based on the feedback so far:
- S is locked in position 5.
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by FIRST feedback).
- R must appear somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS), so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters A, O, E, F, T, D, P are out.

The pattern is: _ I _ _ S with R in 1 or 4.

Testing ""GIRLS"":
- G: new letter
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 – but R was excluded from position 3 by FIRST feedback (R was 2nd in FIRST and marked ✓, so R cannot be 3rd). Thus ""GIRLS"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""R I _ _ S"" with R in 1st:
Need valid 5-letter words starting with RI and ending with IS:
- R I V I S – no
- R I N G S – G is allowed, and R I N G S fits the pattern _ I _ _ S with R in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd, G in 4th, S in 5th. This seems valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place. Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but neither is in its original position (R was 2nd, S was 4th).
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep R and S in new positions.
2. Avoid A, O, E.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""FIRST"":
- F: new letter
- I: new vowel (since E is out)
- R: known in word, now in position 2
- S: known in word, now in position 3
- T: new letter

This repositions R and S and tests new letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: FIRST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FIRST:
- F: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- R: still in the word but wrong position (-) – previously it was 2nd, now it’s 3rd, so it must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- S: still in the word but wrong position (-) – previously it was 4th, now it’s 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, or 5th. But 2nd is already taken by I, so 1st or 5th.
- T: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), R, S
- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- S cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But 2nd is I, so 1 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Contains R and S in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, E, F, T).

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ _ with R and S in 1, 4, or 5, and no repeats.

Let’s try “WISPS”:
- W: new letter
- I: correct position 2
- S: could be 3rd (but 3rd is allowed for S since it wasn’t tested there before)
- P: new letter
- S: could be 5th

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 5th is allowed. However, we don’t know if S is 1st, 5th, etc. Another approach: place R and S in new positions.

Better candidate: “DRIPS”
- D: new letter
- R: 2nd position – but I is already 2nd, so no.
Wait, I must be 2nd.

Let’s try “R” in 1st, “S” in 5th: “R I _ _ S” – but I is 2nd, so “_ I _ _ _” with R and S elsewhere.

Try “CHIRS” – but C, H, I, R, S. I is 3rd here, must be 2nd.

Correct pattern: _ I _ _ _

Let’s pick “R” in 4th and “S” in 1st: S I _ R _
But we need 5 letters.

Try “S I N G R” – no, 5 letters only.

Better: “D I S C R” – no, C and R.

Wait, simpler: “R I S E N” – but E is out.

“R I S K Y” – Y is ok, but K is ok.

But R cannot be 3rd (from FIRST), so 1,4,5.

Let’s try “R I S K Y”:
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (correct)
- S: 3rd (allowed, since it was 4th and 3rd before, now 3rd is new)
- K: new
- Y: new

This tests R in 1st, S in 3rd, and introduces K and Y.

<guess>DRIPS</guess> – no, R is 2nd, I is 3rd, must have I 2nd.

Correct: “R I S K Y” – but R is 1st, I 2nd, S 3rd, K 4th, Y 5th.

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 3rd is new, allowed.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: FIRST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
Guess 3: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback on DRIPS:

D (x) – not in the word  
R (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in FIRST, 3rd in DRIPS)  
I (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in DRIPS)  
P (x) – not in the word  
S (✓) – in the word and in the correct 5th position  

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T, D, P
- Letters in the word: I, R, S
- S is fixed in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from DRIPS) and not in position 2 (from FIRST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But 5 is taken by S, so R must be in 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- If I is in position 1: I _ _ _ S
- If I is in position 4: _ _ _ I S
- R must fit into the remaining spots.

Also, remaining allowed letters (excluding known absent ones): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's explore the I _ _ _ S pattern first:
I _ _ _ S
R must be in position 3 or 4 (but 4 is open if I is 1st). But R can't be 3rd (from FIRST), so R would have to be 4th. Then we have:
I _ _ R S

We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Common combinations: 
- C and H: I C H R S (ICHRS – not a word)
- B and R: but R is used.
- L and N: I L N R S (ILNRS – not a word)
- M and B: I M B R S (IMBRS – not a word)

Hmm, not finding valid words here. Let's try the other pattern where I is in position 4:
_ _ _ I S
R must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for R). Let's try:
R _ _ I S
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Possible valid words:
- R U N I S (RUNIS – not a word)
- R A I N S – but A is out
- R I V I S – no
- R O N I S – O is out
- R U B I S – no
- R U L I S – no
- R U N I S – no
- R U M I S – no
- R U C I S – no
- R U L I S – no

Wait, let's try C in position 2:
_ C _ I S
R must be 1st or 3rd. 3rd is excluded for R, so 1st:
R C _ I S
Need a consonant for position 3: R C B I S (RCBIS – no), R C H I S (RCHIS – no), R C L I S (RCLIS – no), R C M I S (RCMIS – no), R C N I S (RCNIS – no), R C U I S (RCUIS – no).

Not working. Let's try B in position 2:
_ B _ I S
R must be 1st: R B _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R B L I S (RBLIS – no), R B N I S (RBNIS – no), R B C I S (RBCIS – no), R B U I S (RBUIS – no).

Hmm. Let's try G in position 2:
_ G _ I S
R must be 1st: R G _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R G N I S (RGNIS – no), R G U I S (RGUIS – no).

This seems tough. Maybe I should try the pattern with R in position 4:
_ _ _ R S
I must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for I). Let's try:
I _ _ R S
Need consonants for 2 and 3: I C H R S (ICHRS – no), I N K R S (INKRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no), I M B R S (IMBRS – no), I L B R S (ILBRS – no), I L N R S (ILNRS – no), I L U R S (ILURS – no), I L V R S (ILVRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no).

Wait, let's try ""H"" in position 2:
_ H _ R S
I must be 1st: I H _ R S
Need consonant for 3rd: I H N R S (IHNRS – no), I H K R S (IHKRS – no), I H L R S (IHLRS – no), I H M R S (IHMRS – no), I H U R S (IHURS – no), I H V R S (IHVRS – no).

This isn't working. Let me re-examine possible words ending in ""IS"" with R somewhere.

Wait, what about ""R I S"" in different positions? We know S is 5th, so:
Possible words: _ _ _ _ S with R and I placed correctly.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending in S with I and R:
- R I S K S – but K is ok, but S is already 5th, so this would be R I S K S – but that has S in 4th and 5th, which might be allowed.
But let's check: R I S K S
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (but I cannot be 2nd from FIRST feedback where I was 2nd and marked ✓ in position 2, but in FIRST I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I must be 2nd. Wait, no: in FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is definitely 2nd. So the word must be _ I _ _ S.

Ah! I was wrong earlier. In FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is 2nd. So the word is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 or 5). From DRIPS, R was 2nd (but 2nd is I), so R must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
But from DRIPS, R was 2nd (but that's I's spot), so R is not 2nd. So R can be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Also, from DRIPS, I was 3rd (but I is actually 2nd), so that's consistent.

So the pattern is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
Possible words:
- R I _ _ S: but R can't be 2nd (it's 1st here), so possible:
  R I _ _ S: need 3rd and 4th letters. Possible: R I V E S – but E is out.
  R I N G S – G is ok, but we have no info on G.
  R I S K S – but S is 5th, so 3rd S would duplicate S.
  R I D G S – D is out.
  R I C H S – C and H are ok, but is RICH S a word? No.

- _ I R _ S: R in 3rd
  Possible: B I R K S – B, K ok
  C I R C S – no
  D I R T S – D and T out
  F I R E S – F and E out
  G I R L S – G, L ok
  H I R L S – H, L ok
  M I R K S – M, K ok
  N I R V S – N, V ok
  P I R C S – P out
  S I R R S – S out
  W I R E S – W, E out
  Y I R L S – Y, L ok

- _ I _ R S: R in 4th
  Possible: B I N R S – no
  C I N R S – no
  G I V R S – no
  H I N R S – no
  M I N R S – no
  N I C R S – no
  V I N R S – no
  W I N R S – no
  Y I N R S – no

From these, the most promising are:
- B I R K S
- C I R C S – no
- G I R L S
- H I R L S
- M I R K S
- N I R V S
- Y I R L S

Looking at these, ""BIRKS"" is a valid word (though uncommon), ""GIRLS"" is common but uses G, I, R, L, S. Let's check:
G I R L S:
- G: new
- I: 2nd (correct)
- R: 3rd (allowed)
- L: new
- S: 5th (correct)

This seems valid and uses allowed letters.

Another good one is ""MIRKS"" – but ""mirks"" is archaic.

""GIRLS"" seems the best choice.

<guess>GIRLS</guess>Based on the feedback so far:
- S is locked in position 5.
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by FIRST feedback).
- R must appear somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS), so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters A, O, E, F, T, D, P are out.

The pattern is: _ I _ _ S with R in 1 or 4.

Testing ""GIRLS"":
- G: new letter
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 – but R was excluded from position 3 by FIRST feedback (R was 2nd in FIRST and marked ✓, so R cannot be 3rd). Thus ""GIRLS"" is invalid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong place. Other strong candidates could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a solid choice.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but neither is in its original position (R was 2nd, S was 4th).
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep R and S in new positions.
2. Avoid A, O, E.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""FIRST"":
- F: new letter
- I: new vowel (since E is out)
- R: known in word, now in position 2
- S: known in word, now in position 3
- T: new letter

This repositions R and S and tests new letters.

Guess 2: FIRST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FIRST:
- F: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓)
- R: still in the word but wrong position (-) – previously it was 2nd, now it’s 3rd, so it must be 1st, 4th, or 5th.
- S: still in the word but wrong position (-) – previously it was 4th, now it’s 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, or 5th. But 2nd is already taken by I, so 1st or 5th.
- T: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), R, S
- R cannot be 2nd or 3rd → possible positions: 1, 4, 5
- S cannot be 3rd or 4th → possible positions: 1, 2, 5. But 2nd is I, so 1 or 5.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Contains R and S in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, E, F, T).

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ _ _ with R and S in 1, 4, or 5, and no repeats.

Let’s try “WISPS”:
- W: new letter
- I: correct position 2
- S: could be 3rd (but 3rd is allowed for S since it wasn’t tested there before)
- P: new letter
- S: could be 5th

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 5th is allowed. However, we don’t know if S is 1st, 5th, etc. Another approach: place R and S in new positions.

Better candidate: “DRIPS”
- D: new letter
- R: 2nd position – but I is already 2nd, so no.
Wait, I must be 2nd.

Let’s try “R” in 1st, “S” in 5th: “R I _ _ S” – but I is 2nd, so “_ I _ _ _” with R and S elsewhere.

Try “CHIRS” – but C, H, I, R, S. I is 3rd here, must be 2nd.

Correct pattern: _ I _ _ _

Let’s pick “R” in 4th and “S” in 1st: S I _ R _
But we need 5 letters.

Try “S I N G R” – no, 5 letters only.

Better: “D I S C R” – no, C and R.

Wait, simpler: “R I S E N” – but E is out.

“R I S K Y” – Y is ok, but K is ok.

But R cannot be 3rd (from FIRST), so 1,4,5.

Let’s try “R I S K Y”:
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (correct)
- S: 3rd (allowed, since it was 4th and 3rd before, now 3rd is new)
- K: new
- Y: new

This tests R in 1st, S in 3rd, and introduces K and Y.

<guess>DRIPS</guess> – no, R is 2nd, I is 3rd, must have I 2nd.

Correct: “R I S K Y” – but R is 1st, I 2nd, S 3rd, K 4th, Y 5th.

But S was 4th in AROSE and 3rd in FIRST, so 3rd is new, allowed.

Let's parse the new feedback on DRIPS:

D (x) – not in the word  
R (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in FIRST, 3rd in DRIPS)  
I (-) – in the word but wrong position (it was 2nd in DRIPS)  
P (x) – not in the word  
S (✓) – in the word and in the correct 5th position  

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T, D, P
- Letters in the word: I, R, S
- S is fixed in position 5: _ _ _ _ S
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from DRIPS) and not in position 2 (from FIRST). So I must be in position 1 or 4.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5. But 5 is taken by S, so R must be in 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- If I is in position 1: I _ _ _ S
- If I is in position 4: _ _ _ I S
- R must fit into the remaining spots.

Also, remaining allowed letters (excluding known absent ones): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's explore the I _ _ _ S pattern first:
I _ _ _ S
R must be in position 3 or 4 (but 4 is open if I is 1st). But R can't be 3rd (from FIRST), so R would have to be 4th. Then we have:
I _ _ R S

We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Common combinations: 
- C and H: I C H R S (ICHRS – not a word)
- B and R: but R is used.
- L and N: I L N R S (ILNRS – not a word)
- M and B: I M B R S (IMBRS – not a word)

Hmm, not finding valid words here. Let's try the other pattern where I is in position 4:
_ _ _ I S
R must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for R). Let's try:
R _ _ I S
We need two consonants for positions 2 and 3. Possible valid words:
- R U N I S (RUNIS – not a word)
- R A I N S – but A is out
- R I V I S – no
- R O N I S – O is out
- R U B I S – no
- R U L I S – no
- R U N I S – no
- R U M I S – no
- R U C I S – no
- R U L I S – no

Wait, let's try C in position 2:
_ C _ I S
R must be 1st or 3rd. 3rd is excluded for R, so 1st:
R C _ I S
Need a consonant for position 3: R C B I S (RCBIS – no), R C H I S (RCHIS – no), R C L I S (RCLIS – no), R C M I S (RCMIS – no), R C N I S (RCNIS – no), R C U I S (RCUIS – no).

Not working. Let's try B in position 2:
_ B _ I S
R must be 1st: R B _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R B L I S (RBLIS – no), R B N I S (RBNIS – no), R B C I S (RBCIS – no), R B U I S (RBUIS – no).

Hmm. Let's try G in position 2:
_ G _ I S
R must be 1st: R G _ I S
Need consonant for 3rd: R G N I S (RGNIS – no), R G U I S (RGUIS – no).

This seems tough. Maybe I should try the pattern with R in position 4:
_ _ _ R S
I must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3rd is excluded for I). Let's try:
I _ _ R S
Need consonants for 2 and 3: I C H R S (ICHRS – no), I N K R S (INKRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no), I M B R S (IMBRS – no), I L B R S (ILBRS – no), I L N R S (ILNRS – no), I L U R S (ILURS – no), I L V R S (ILVRS – no), I L K R S (ILKRS – no).

Wait, let's try ""H"" in position 2:
_ H _ R S
I must be 1st: I H _ R S
Need consonant for 3rd: I H N R S (IHNRS – no), I H K R S (IHKRS – no), I H L R S (IHLRS – no), I H M R S (IHMRS – no), I H U R S (IHURS – no), I H V R S (IHVRS – no).

This isn't working. Let me re-examine possible words ending in ""IS"" with R somewhere.

Wait, what about ""R I S"" in different positions? We know S is 5th, so:
Possible words: _ _ _ _ S with R and I placed correctly.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words ending in S with I and R:
- R I S K S – but K is ok, but S is already 5th, so this would be R I S K S – but that has S in 4th and 5th, which might be allowed.
But let's check: R I S K S
- R: 1st (allowed)
- I: 2nd (but I cannot be 2nd from FIRST feedback where I was 2nd and marked ✓ in position 2, but in FIRST I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I must be 2nd. Wait, no: in FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is definitely 2nd. So the word must be _ I _ _ S.

Ah! I was wrong earlier. In FIRST, I was 2nd and marked ✓, so I is 2nd. So the word is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2 or 5). From DRIPS, R was 2nd (but 2nd is I), so R must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
But from DRIPS, R was 2nd (but that's I's spot), so R is not 2nd. So R can be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Also, from DRIPS, I was 3rd (but I is actually 2nd), so that's consistent.

So the pattern is:
_ I _ _ S
R must be in 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
Possible words:
- R I _ _ S: but R can't be 2nd (it's 1st here), so possible:
  R I _ _ S: need 3rd and 4th letters. Possible: R I V E S – but E is out.
  R I N G S – G is ok, but we have no info on G.
  R I S K S – but S is 5th, so 3rd S would duplicate S.
  R I D G S – D is out.
  R I C H S – C and H are ok, but is RICH S a word? No.

- _ I R _ S: R in 3rd
  Possible: B I R K S – B, K ok
  C I R C S – no
  D I R T S – D and T out
  F I R E S – F and E out
  G I R L S – G, L ok
  H I R L S – H, L ok
  M I R K S – M, K ok
  N I R V S – N, V ok
  P I R C S – P out
  S I R R S – S out
  W I R E S – W, E out
  Y I R L S – Y, L ok

- _ I _ R S: R in 4th
  Possible: B I N R S – no
  C I N R S – no
  G I V R S – no
  H I N R S – no
  M I N R S – no
  N I C R S – no
  V I N R S – no
  W I N R S – no
  Y I N R S – no

From these, the most promising are:
- B I R K S
- C I R C S – no
- G I R L S
- H I R L S
- M I R K S
- N I R V S
- Y I R L S

Looking at these, ""BIRKS"" is a valid word (though uncommon), ""GIRLS"" is common but uses G, I, R, L, S. Let's check:
G I R L S:
- G: new
- I: 2nd (correct)
- R: 3rd (allowed)
- L: new
- S: 5th (correct)

This seems valid and uses allowed letters.

Another good one is ""MIRKS"" – but ""mirks"" is archaic.

""GIRLS"" seems the best choice.

<guess>GIRLS</guess>Based on the feedback so far:
- S is locked in position 5.
- I must be in position 2 (confirmed by FIRST feedback).
- R must appear somewhere in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from FIRST and DRIPS), so it must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters A, O, E, F, T, D, P are out.

The pattern is: _ I _ _ S with R in 1 or 4.

Testing ""GIRLS"":
- G: new letter
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 – but R was excluded from position 3 by FIRST feedback (R was 2nd in FIRST and marked ✓, so R cannot be 3rd). Thus ""GIRLS"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""R I _ _ S"" with R in 1st:
Need valid 5-letter words starting with RI and ending with IS:

- R I N G S – G is allowed, and R I N G S fits the pattern _ I _ _ S with R in 1st, I in 2nd, N in 3rd, G in 4th, S in 5th. This seems valid.

""RINGS"" uses allowed letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: FIRST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
Guess 3: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: GIRLS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) I(✓) R(-) L(x) S(✓)

From the latest feedback on GIRLS:
- G: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word and in the correct 2nd position (✓) – confirmed again
- R: in the word but wrong position (-) – must be placed correctly
- L: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓) – confirmed again

So the pattern is now:
_ I _ _ S
with R somewhere in the remaining positions (1st, 3rd, or 4th) and no other letters from the banned list (A, O, E, F, T, D, P, G, L).

Remaining allowed letters: B, C, H, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words fitting _ I _ _ S with R in 1st, 3rd, or 4th:
- R I _ _ S: R in 1st
  Need valid words: R I N G S (RINGS), R I V E S (invalid E), R I D G S (invalid D), R I B E S (invalid E), R I C H S (invalid H in 4th), etc.
  Only valid: R I N G S

- _ I R _ S: R in 3rd
  Need valid words: B I R K S (BIRKS – uncommon), C I R C S (invalid), H I R K S (invalid), M I R K S (MIRKS – archaic), N I R V S (NIRVS – invalid), etc.
  No common valid words.

- _ I _ R S: R in 4th
  Need valid words: B I N R S (invalid), C I N R S (invalid), H I N R S (invalid), M I N R S (invalid), etc.
  No valid words.

Thus, the only valid remaining word is R I N G S.
