- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and can potentially give us information about multiple vowels and common consonants.

Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: not in word
- A: in word, correct position (1st letter)
- I, S, E: not in word

From Guess 2 (ALOUD):
- A: in word but wrong position (-) — this contradicts Guess 1 where A was marked ✓ (correct position).  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 2 was misinterpreted. Re-reading carefully:
  - Guess 1: A(✓) means A is correct in position 1.
  - Guess 2: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1. This is impossible because Guess 1 already confirmed A is in position 1.  
  Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-). Assuming this is a mistake, we proceed with the confirmed information.

Confirmed facts:
1. Word starts with A (from RAISE feedback).
2. Letters not in word: R, I, S, E, U, L, D.
3. Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 2, we learned O is in the word (✓ in position 3). So the word is A _ O _ _.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, etc.

Possible words:
- A B O N T
- A C O R N (but R is ruled out)
- A M O N T
- A F O R T (R is out)
- A H O N E (E is out)
- A M O B E (E is out)

Valid options: AMONT, ABONT, AFONT, AHONT, etc. But these aren't real words. Let's think of real words matching A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.

Real words:
- ABORT (R is out)
- ACORN (R is out)
- ALONG (L is out)
- AMONG (M, O, N, G - all possible)
- APHID (D is out)
- AFOOT
- AGONY (N, Y possible)
- AMOK (but needs 5 letters)

AMONG seems valid: A M O N G. Let's check letters:
- A: confirmed position 1
- M: new, possible
- O: confirmed position 3
- N: new, possible
- G: new, possible

No conflicts with ruled-out letters. So AMONG is a good next guess.

   The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for Guess 2 was intended to have A(✓) in position 1 (since that’s already confirmed), and the (-) likely applies to a different letter.  
   Re-reading the original feedback: the first letter A in ALOUD was marked (-), which is impossible because Guess 1 already fixed A in position 1.  
   Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must contain an error. Proceeding with the confirmed facts:

Confirmed facts after all guesses:

- Letters not in word: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, having O in position 3, and using only remaining letters for positions 2, 4, 5.

Possible words:
- A B O T _
- A C O T _
- A F O T _

Real words fitting A _ O T _:

- AHOOT (not a valid word)

Looking at remaining letters, let's try:
- A B O T E → E is out
- A B O T Y → Y is possible
- A B O T T → T is possible
- A F O T Y → Y is possible
- A H O T Y → Y is possible

The word ""ABOTY"" isn't valid. ""ABORT"" is invalid (R). ""AFOTY"" isn't a word. ""AHOTY"" isn't a word.

- AFOUL (A F O U L) - U and L are out
- AFOOT is the only close, but double O.

- AFOUL (A F O U L) - U is out

Check letters:
- A: position 1 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and can potentially give us information about multiple vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the word is A _ _ _ _
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with A and avoids R, I, S, E.  
Good remaining consonants to test next: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, etc.  
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A is already fixed).

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _  
Let’s try a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, such as A, O, N, T, L.  
A good candidate is “AONT?”, but that’s not a valid word.  
Another candidate is “ALOUD” (A, L, O, U, D) — all letters are still possible and it tests new letters.

So I’ll guess ALOUD.

Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: not in word
- A: in word, correct position (1st letter)
- I, S, E: not in word

From Guess 2 (ALOUD):
- A: in word but wrong position (-) — this contradicts Guess 1 where A was marked ✓ (correct position).  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 2 was misinterpreted. Re-reading carefully:
  - Guess 1: A(✓) means A is correct in position 1.
  - Guess 2: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1. This is impossible because Guess 1 already confirmed A is in position 1.  
  Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-). Assuming this is a mistake, we proceed with the confirmed information.

Confirmed facts:
1. Word starts with A (from RAISE feedback).
2. Letters not in word: R, I, S, E, U, L, D.
3. Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 2, we learned O is in the word (✓ in position 3). So the word is A _ O _ _.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, etc.

Possible words:
- A B O N T
- A C O R N (but R is ruled out)
- A M O N T
- A F O R T (R is out)
- A H O N E (E is out)
- A M O B E (E is out)

Valid options: AMONT, ABONT, AFONT, AHONT, etc. But these aren't real words. Let's think of real words matching A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.

Real words:

- ACORN (R is out)
- ALONG (L is out)
- AMONG (M, O, N, G - all possible)
- APHID (D is out)

Let's reconcile the feedback carefully:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word is A _ _ _ _ with no R, I, S, E.

2. ALOUD → A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   The first letter A cannot be wrong (it was ✓ in position 1 in RAISE).  
   Therefore the feedback for ALOUD must have been intended as:  
   A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.

3. AMONG → A(-) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)  
   Again, A is in position 1, so the first letter must have been a typo and should also be ✓.  
   Therefore the feedback should be:  
   A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) — confirming A and O are correct, and ruling out M, N, G.

4. AFOOT → A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
   Interpreting the same way:  
   A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x) — so the word has A _ O _ _ and the second O is in the word but not in position 4; it must be in position 2.  
   Therefore the pattern is now: A O O _ _

Letters already ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G, F, T.

Remaining possible letters for positions 4-5: B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A O O _ _.  
Valid English words:  
- AOOTS (not valid)  
- AOORE (E is out)  
- AOON_ (N is out)  
- AOOP_ (P is possible)  

The only plausible real word is AOOPS (but not common), or AOON_ (invalid).  
Rechecking: the pattern is A O O _ _, and the only valid word is AOOPS (slang), but more likely is AOON_ which doesn't exist.  

Wait — let's re-examine the feedback for AFOOT more carefully.  
The feedback was: A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
If we strictly interpret the symbols as given, this implies:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (impossible, since A was ✓ in position 1 in RAISE)  
- F is not in the word  
- O is in position 3 (✓)  
- Second O is in the word but not in position 4  
- T is not in the word  

This creates a contradiction because A cannot simultaneously be in position 1 and also be in the word but not in position 1.  
The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for AFOOT contains a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-).  

Therefore, assuming the typo and proceeding with the confirmed information:  
Pattern: A _ O _ _  
Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G, F, T  
Remaining letters: B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ using these letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- A B O K T (not a word)  
- A C O B T (not a word)  
- A H O C K (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is A H O C K (not valid), A C O B T (not valid), etc.  

Rechecking valid English words:  
- ABOCK (not 5 letters)  
- ACOCK (not 5 letters)  
- AHOCK (not 5 letters)  
- ABOAT (T is out)  
- ACOAT (T is out)  
- AHOAT (T is out)  

Looking again, the valid word is AHOY (but 4 letters).  

Realizing the only possible valid word left is AHOY, but it's 4 letters.  

Wait — let's list all valid 5-letter words starting with A, with O in position 3:  
- A B O R T (R, T out)  
- A C O R N (R, N out)  
- A D O R E (D, E out)  
- A F O R T (F, R, T out)  
- A G O N Y (G, N out)  
- A H O R S (H, S out)  
- A J O B S (J, B, S out)

- A R O M A (R out)  
- A S O R T (S, T out)  
- A T O N E (T, N, E out)  
- A V O C A (V, C, A possible)  
- A W O N E (W, N, E out)  
- A X O N Y (X, N, Y out)  
- A Z O R E (Z, R, E out)  

The only valid remaining word is APOCK or AVOCY (not valid).  

But APOCK is not a standard word.  

Rechecking, the valid word is APOCK (not common), but more likely is AHOY (4 letters).  

Realizing the only possible valid word left is APOCK (not standard), but looking up, the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  

This suggests the pattern might be A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.  

Upon deeper inspection, the valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is APOCK (not standard), but the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  

This indicates an error in earlier steps.  

Re-examining the feedback for ALOUD:  
Original feedback: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
The (-) for A implies A is in the word but not in position 1, which contradicts RAISE.  

The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for ALOUD was intended as:  
A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.  

With this interpretation, the facts are:  
- Pattern: A _ O _ _  
- Letters in word: A, O, L  
- Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, D, M, N, G, F, T  

Therefore, the word must contain A, O, L in positions 1, 3, and one more position.  

Possible positions for L: positions 2, 4, or 5.  

But O is in position 3, so L can be in 2, 4, or 5.  

We need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ containing L.  

Possible words:  
- A L O N E (N, E out)  
- A L O U D (U, D out)  
- A B O L T (B, T out)  
- A C O L D (C, D out)  
- A H O L D (H, D out)  
- A J O L L (J, L possible)  
- A P O L L (P, L possible)  
- A V O L T (V, T out)  

The valid words are:  
- AJOll (not standard)  
- APoll (as in Apollo)  
- AVoll (not standard)  

The most likely valid word is APOLL (short for Apollo).  

Checking letters:  
A (position 1) ✓  
P (position 2) possible  
O (position 3) ✓  
L (position 4) possible  
L (position 5) possible  

No conflicts with ruled-out letters.  

Thus, the next guess is APOLL.

   A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) — confirming A and O are correct, and ruling out M, N, G.

4. AFOOT → A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)

   A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x) — so the word has A _ O _ _ and the second O is in the word but not in position 4; it must be in position 2.

Upon deeper inspection, the valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is APOCK (not standard), but the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  

This indicates an error in earlier steps.  

Re-examining the feedback for ALOUD:  
Original feedback: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
The (-) for A implies A is in the word but not in position 1, which contradicts RAISE.  

The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for ALOUD was intended as:  
A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.  

With this interpretation, the facts are:  
- Pattern: A _ O _ _  
- Letters in word: A, O, L  
- Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, D, M, N, G, F, T  

Therefore, the word must contain A, O, L in positions 1, 3, and one more position.  

Possible positions for L: positions 2, 4, or 5.  

But O is in position 3, so L can be in 2, 4, or 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and can potentially give us information about multiple vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the word is A _ _ _ _
- I, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It does NOT contain R, I, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with A and avoids R, I, S, E.  
Good remaining consonants to test next: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, etc.  
Good vowels left to test: O, U (since A is already fixed).

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ _  
Let’s try a word that uses common letters not yet ruled out, such as A, O, N, T, L.  
A good candidate is “AONT?”, but that’s not a valid word.  
Another candidate is “ALOUD” (A, L, O, U, D) — all letters are still possible and it tests new letters.

So I’ll guess ALOUD.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (RAISE):
- R: not in word
- A: in word, correct position (1st letter)
- I, S, E: not in word

From Guess 2 (ALOUD):
- A: in word but wrong position (-) — this contradicts Guess 1 where A was marked ✓ (correct position).  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback for Guess 2 was misinterpreted. Re-reading carefully:
  - Guess 1: A(✓) means A is correct in position 1.
  - Guess 2: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1. This is impossible because Guess 1 already confirmed A is in position 1.  
  Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must have a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-). Assuming this is a mistake, we proceed with the confirmed information.

Confirmed facts:
1. Word starts with A (from RAISE feedback).
2. Letters not in word: R, I, S, E, U, L, D.
3. Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

From Guess 2, we learned O is in the word (✓ in position 3). So the word is A _ O _ _.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not yet ruled out. Common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, etc.

Possible words:
- A B O N T
- A C O R N (but R is ruled out)
- A M O N T
- A F O R T (R is out)
- A H O N E (E is out)
- A M O B E (E is out)

Valid options: AMONT, ABONT, AFONT, AHONT, etc. But these aren't real words. Let's think of real words matching A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.

Real words:
- ABORT (R is out)
- ACORN (R is out)
- ALONG (L is out)
- AMONG (M, O, N, G - all possible)
- APHID (D is out)
- AFOOT
- AGONY (N, Y possible)
- AMOK (but needs 5 letters)

AMONG seems valid: A M O N G. Let's check letters:
- A: confirmed position 1
- M: new, possible
- O: confirmed position 3
- N: new, possible
- G: new, possible

No conflicts with ruled-out letters. So AMONG is a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: AMONG -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's carefully reconcile the feedback:

1. Guess 1: RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in position 1 (✓).

2. Guess 2: ALOUD → A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - The feedback for A here is (-), but this contradicts Guess 1 where A was ✓ in position 1.  
   The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for Guess 2 was intended to have A(✓) in position 1 (since that’s already confirmed), and the (-) likely applies to a different letter.  
   Re-reading the original feedback: the first letter A in ALOUD was marked (-), which is impossible because Guess 1 already fixed A in position 1.  
   Therefore, the feedback for Guess 2 must contain an error. Proceeding with the confirmed facts:

Confirmed facts after all guesses:
- Word pattern: A _ O _ _  (from Guess 1 and Guess 2/O)
- Letters not in word: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, having O in position 3, and using only remaining letters for positions 2, 4, 5.

Possible words:
- A B O T _
- A C O T _
- A F O T _
- A H O T _
- A P O T _

Real words fitting A _ O T _:
- AFOOT (but F is possible, T is possible, but we need to check remaining letters)
- AHOOT (not a valid word)
- ABORT (R is out)
- ACORN (R, N are out)
- AFIRE (I, R, E are out)

Looking at remaining letters, let's try:
- A B O T E → E is out
- A B O T Y → Y is possible
- A B O T T → T is possible
- A F O T Y → Y is possible
- A H O T Y → Y is possible

The word ""ABOTY"" isn't valid. ""ABORT"" is invalid (R). ""AFOTY"" isn't a word. ""AHOTY"" isn't a word. 

Let's try ""ABOT"" plus a valid ending. Actually, let's list valid words:
- AFOOT (A F O O T) - but has two O's, and we only know one O is confirmed in position 3.
- AFOUL (A F O U L) - U and L are out
- AFOOT is the only close, but double O.

Looking again, valid words starting A, O in position 3:
- A B O R T (R, O, T - R is out)
- A C O R N (R, N are out)
- A F O R T (R is out)
- A H O R D (R, D are out)
- A L O N E (L, N, E are out)
- A M O N G (M, N, G are out)

Actually, let's think differently - we know A _ O _ _, and remaining letters for positions 2,4,5 are from B, C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible valid words:
- A B O T Y (not a word)
- A C O T Y (not a word)
- A F O T Y (not a word)
- A H O T Y (not a word)
- A B O K T (not a word)
- A C O K T (not a word)
- A F O K T (not a word)
- A H O K T (not a word)

Wait, let's list real words matching A _ O _ _:
- AFOOT (A F O O T) - but O is in position 3, so A F O O T would have O in 3 and 4 - possible
- AFOUL (A F O U L) - U is out
- AFOOT is the only possible real word left: A F O O T

Check letters:
- A: position 1 (✓)
- F: new, possible
- O: position 3 (✓)
- O: position 4 (new, possible)
- T: new, possible

No conflicts with ruled-out letters. So AFOOT is the best next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 3: AMONG -> FEEDBACK: A(-) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)
Guess 4: AFOOT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's reconcile the feedback carefully:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word is A _ _ _ _ with no R, I, S, E.

2. ALOUD → A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   The first letter A cannot be wrong (it was ✓ in position 1 in RAISE).  
   Therefore the feedback for ALOUD must have been intended as:  
   A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.

3. AMONG → A(-) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)  
   Again, A is in position 1, so the first letter must have been a typo and should also be ✓.  
   Therefore the feedback should be:  
   A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) — confirming A and O are correct, and ruling out M, N, G.

4. AFOOT → A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
   Interpreting the same way:  
   A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x) — so the word has A _ O _ _ and the second O is in the word but not in position 4; it must be in position 2.  
   Therefore the pattern is now: A O O _ _

Letters already ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G, F, T.

Remaining possible letters for positions 4-5: B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form A O O _ _.  
Valid English words:  
- AOOTS (not valid)  
- AOORE (E is out)  
- AOON_ (N is out)  
- AOOP_ (P is possible)  

The only plausible real word is AOOPS (but not common), or AOON_ (invalid).  
Rechecking: the pattern is A O O _ _, and the only valid word is AOOPS (slang), but more likely is AOON_ which doesn't exist.  

Wait — let's re-examine the feedback for AFOOT more carefully.  
The feedback was: A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
If we strictly interpret the symbols as given, this implies:  
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (impossible, since A was ✓ in position 1 in RAISE)  
- F is not in the word  
- O is in position 3 (✓)  
- Second O is in the word but not in position 4  
- T is not in the word  

This creates a contradiction because A cannot simultaneously be in position 1 and also be in the word but not in position 1.  
The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for AFOOT contains a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-).  

Therefore, assuming the typo and proceeding with the confirmed information:  
Pattern: A _ O _ _  
Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G, F, T  
Remaining letters: B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ using these letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- A B O K T (not a word)  
- A C O B T (not a word)  
- A H O C K (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is A H O C K (not valid), A C O B T (not valid), etc.  

Rechecking valid English words:  
- ABOCK (not 5 letters)  
- ACOCK (not 5 letters)  
- AHOCK (not 5 letters)  
- ABOAT (T is out)  
- ACOAT (T is out)  
- AHOAT (T is out)  

Looking again, the valid word is AHOY (but 4 letters).  

Realizing the only possible valid word left is AHOY, but it's 4 letters.  

Wait — let's list all valid 5-letter words starting with A, with O in position 3:  
- A B O R T (R, T out)  
- A C O R N (R, N out)  
- A D O R E (D, E out)  
- A F O R T (F, R, T out)  
- A G O N Y (G, N out)  
- A H O R S (H, S out)  
- A J O B S (J, B, S out)  
- A K O N T (K, N, T out)  
- A L O N E (L, N, E out)  
- A M O N G (M, N, G out)  
- A P O C K (P, C, K possible)  
- A R O M A (R out)  
- A S O R T (S, T out)  
- A T O N E (T, N, E out)  
- A V O C A (V, C, A possible)  
- A W O N E (W, N, E out)  
- A X O N Y (X, N, Y out)  
- A Z O R E (Z, R, E out)  

The only valid remaining word is APOCK or AVOCY (not valid).  

But APOCK is not a standard word.  

Rechecking, the valid word is APOCK (not common), but more likely is AHOY (4 letters).  

Realizing the only possible valid word left is APOCK (not standard), but looking up, the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  

This suggests the pattern might be A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.  

Upon deeper inspection, the valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is APOCK (not standard), but the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  

This indicates an error in earlier steps.  

Re-examining the feedback for ALOUD:  
Original feedback: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
The (-) for A implies A is in the word but not in position 1, which contradicts RAISE.  

The only consistent resolution is that the feedback for ALOUD was intended as:  
A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.  

With this interpretation, the facts are:  
- Pattern: A _ O _ _  
- Letters in word: A, O, L  
- Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, D, M, N, G, F, T  

Therefore, the word must contain A, O, L in positions 1, 3, and one more position.  

Possible positions for L: positions 2, 4, or 5.  

But O is in position 3, so L can be in 2, 4, or 5.  

We need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ containing L.  

Possible words:  
- A L O N E (N, E out)  
- A L O U D (U, D out)  
- A B O L T (B, T out)  
- A C O L D (C, D out)  
- A H O L D (H, D out)  
- A J O L L (J, L possible)  
- A P O L L (P, L possible)  
- A V O L T (V, T out)  

The valid words are:  
- AJOll (not standard)  
- APoll (as in Apollo)  
- AVoll (not standard)  

The most likely valid word is APOLL (short for Apollo).  

Checking letters:  
A (position 1) ✓  
P (position 2) possible  
O (position 3) ✓  
L (position 4) possible  
L (position 5) possible  

No conflicts with ruled-out letters.  

Thus, the next guess is APOLL.

let's re-examine the feedback for AFOOT more carefully.  \nThe feedback was: A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  \nIf we strictly interpret the symbols as given, this implies:  \n- A is in the word but not in

\n\nThis creates a contradiction because A cannot simultaneously be in position 1 and also be in the word but not in position 1.  \nThe only consistent resolution is that the feedback for AFOOT contains a typo: the first letter A should have been (✓) not (-).  \n\nTherefore, assuming the typo and proceeding with the confirmed information:  \nPattern: A _ O _ _  \nLetters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, L, D, M, N, G, F, T  \nRemaining letters: B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  \n\nWe need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ using these letters.  \nPossible candidates:  \n- A B O K T (not a word)  \n- A C O B T (not a word)  \n- A H O C K (not a word)  \n\nThe only valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is A H O C K (not valid), A C O B T (not valid), etc.  \n\nRechecking valid English

word.  \n\nRechecking, the valid word is APOCK (not common), but more likely is AHOY (4 letters).  \n\nRealizing the only possible valid word left is APOCK (not standard), but looking up, the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  \n\nThis suggests the pattern might be A _ O _ _ with remaining letters.  \n\nUpon deeper inspection, the valid word fitting A _ O _ _ with remaining letters is APOCK (not standard), but the actual valid word is AHOY (4 letters).  \n\nThis indicates an error in earlier steps.  \n\nRe-examining the feedback for ALOUD:  \nOriginal feedback: A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  \nThe (-) for A implies A is in the word but not in position 1, which contradicts RAISE.  \n\nThe only consistent resolution is that the feedback for ALOUD was intended as:  \nA(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.  \n\nWith this interpretation, the facts are:  \n- Pattern: A _ O _ _  \n- Letters in word: A, O, L  \n- Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, D, M, N, G, F, T  \n\nTherefore, the word must contain A, O, L in positions 1, 3, and one more position.  \n\nPossible positions for L: positions 2, 4, or 5.  \n\nBut O is in position 3, so L can be in 2, 4, or 5.  \n\nWe need a 5-letter word A _ O _ _ containing L.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- A L O N E (N, E out)  \n- A L O U D (U, D out)  \n- A B O L

Let's reconcile all feedback carefully:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word is A _ _ _ _ with no R, I, S, E.

2. ALOUD → A(-) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   The first letter A cannot be wrong (it was ✓ in position 1 in RAISE).  
   Therefore the feedback must have meant:  
   A(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) — i.e., A is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 2.

3. AMONG → A(-) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x)  
   Again, A is in position 1, so the first letter should have been (✓).  
   Therefore the feedback should be:  
   A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(x) — confirming A and O, and ruling out M, N, G.

4. AFOOT → A(-) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
   Interpreting the same way:  
   A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x) — so the word has A _ O _ _, and the second O is in the word but not in position 4; it must be in position 2.  
   Therefore the pattern is now: A O O _ _

5. APOLL → A(-) P(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-)  
   Interpreting:  
   A(✓) P(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) — so the word has A _ O L _, and P is in the word but not in position 2.

Putting it all together:
- Pattern: A O O L _ (from AFOOT and APOLL)  
- Letters in word: A, O, L, P  
- Letters ruled out: R, I, S, E, U, D, M, N, G, F, T  

We need a 5-letter word A O O L _ using only remaining letters.  
The only possible letter left is Y (since P is already in the word but not in position 2, and we've used A, O, O, L).  

Thus the word must be A O O L Y → AOOLY (not a valid word).  

Realizing the only valid word fitting A _ O L _ is APOOL (not standard) or AFOOL (F is out).  

Rechecking, the valid word is APOOL (as in a pool of water), but it's uncommon.  

However, the most likely valid word is APOOL.  

But let's verify:  
A(✓) O(✓) O(-) L(✓) — this implies A O _ L with O in position 2 or 3.  

Re-examining the feedback for AFOOT:  
A(✓) F(x) O(✓) O(-) T(x) — the second O is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 2.  
Thus the pattern is A O _ _ L.  

From APOLL feedback:  
A(✓) P(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) — so L is in position 4 (✓), and P is in the word but not in position 2.  

Thus the pattern is: A O _ L _ with P in position 3 or 5.  

But position 5 must be a letter not yet used.  

Valid word: A O P L _ → AOPLY (not valid).  

Realizing the only valid word is APOOL (A O O P L), but this contradicts P being in the word.  

Rechecking, the correct pattern is:  
A(1) O(2) _ O(3) L(4) — but this contradicts earlier feedback.  

This indicates the only possible valid word is APOOL, despite being uncommon.  

However, the most likely valid word is APOOL.  

Upon deeper inspection, the valid word is APOOL.  

But to match all feedback, the correct word must be APOOL.  

Thus, the final guess is APOOL.
