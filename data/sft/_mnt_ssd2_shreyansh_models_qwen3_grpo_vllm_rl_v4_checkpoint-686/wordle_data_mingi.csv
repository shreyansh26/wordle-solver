For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. S and T are among the most frequent consonants, A and E are the most common vowels, and L is also very common. This gives us a good spread of letters to test.

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better coverage of common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes the common consonant R which appears in many words.

Let me make sure ""AROSE"" is a valid 5-letter English word - yes, it is (short for aristose or a variant spelling, but generally accepted as valid).

So my first guess will be AROSE.

1. Uses **none** of A, R, O, S, E.  
2. Contains a fresh set of very common letters.  
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common letters still available:  
- Vowels: I, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE.  
- Covers two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  
- It’s a valid English word.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

Therefore the secret word contains both N and I, and they are NOT in the positions they occupied in UNTIL (N was 2nd, I was 4th).  
We also know the remaining three letters must come from the still-unused set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Place N and I in new positions.  
2. Introduce three new consonants that are common enough to give good information.  
3. Be a valid English word.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- “CHINK” – uses C, H, K plus the known letters N and I, and shifts N from 2nd to 3rd and I from 4th to 2nd.  
- “DINER” – but R is already ruled out.  
- “MINCY” – uses M, C, Y plus N and I, and moves N to 2nd (same as before) and I to 3rd; this is less ideal because N stays in a familiar position.  
- “PINKY” – P, I, N, K, Y; N is 3rd (new), I is 2nd (new), and introduces P, K, Y.

“PINKY” seems solid: it repositions both known letters and brings in three new consonants. Let’s lock it in.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. S and T are among the most frequent consonants, A and E are the most common vowels, and L is also very common. This gives us a good spread of letters to test.

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better coverage of common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes the common consonant R which appears in many words.

Let me make sure ""AROSE"" is a valid 5-letter English word - yes, it is (short for aristose or a variant spelling, but generally accepted as valid).

So my first guess will be AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be **not** in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge set of possibilities.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I want a word that:

1. Uses **none** of A, R, O, S, E.  
2. Contains a fresh set of very common letters.  
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common letters still available:  
- Vowels: I, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE.  
- Covers two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  
- It’s a valid English word.

Another candidate could be “BLUNT” or “CHIMP”, but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced.

I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

Therefore the secret word contains both N and I, and they are NOT in the positions they occupied in UNTIL (N was 2nd, I was 4th).  
We also know the remaining three letters must come from the still-unused set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Place N and I in new positions.  
2. Introduce three new consonants that are common enough to give good information.  
3. Be a valid English word.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- “CHINK” – uses C, H, K plus the known letters N and I, and shifts N from 2nd to 3rd and I from 4th to 2nd.  
- “DINER” – but R is already ruled out.  
- “MINCY” – uses M, C, Y plus N and I, and moves N to 2nd (same as before) and I to 3rd; this is less ideal because N stays in a familiar position.  
- “PINKY” – P, I, N, K, Y; N is 3rd (new), I is 2nd (new), and introduces P, K, Y.

“PINKY” seems solid: it repositions both known letters and brings in three new consonants. Let’s lock it in.

It seems like most _ I N _ _ words use O, Y, etc.  
But we have remaining letters: B, D, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at ""DINGY"" – Y invalid.  
""DINGO"" – O invalid.  
""GIMBY"" – Y invalid.  
""WINDY"" – Y invalid.  

Is there any valid word?  
Wait, ""DINGY"" is invalid.

Looking at ""JINGO"" – O invalid.  
""MINGO"" – O invalid.  

This seems impossible. But we must have missed something.

Wait, let me check ""DINGY"" – Y is invalid.  
""DINGO"" – O invalid.  
""GIMBY"" – Y invalid.  

But ""DINGY"" is 5 letters: D I N G Y.  
Y is invalid.  

Similarly, ""GIMBY"" – Y invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. S and T are among the most frequent consonants, A and E are the most common vowels, and L is also very common. This gives us a good spread of letters to test.

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better coverage of common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and includes the common consonant R which appears in many words.

Let me make sure ""AROSE"" is a valid 5-letter English word - yes, it is (short for aristose or a variant spelling, but generally accepted as valid).

So my first guess will be AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be **not** in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge set of possibilities.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I want a word that:

1. Uses **none** of A, R, O, S, E.  
2. Contains a fresh set of very common letters.  
3. Includes a mix of vowels and consonants.

Common letters still available:  
- Vowels: I, U  
- Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE.  
- Covers two new vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L).  
- It’s a valid English word.

Another candidate could be “BLUNT” or “CHIMP”, but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced.

I’ll go with “UNTIL”.

<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, I  

Therefore the secret word contains both N and I, and they are NOT in the positions they occupied in UNTIL (N was 2nd, I was 4th).  
We also know the remaining three letters must come from the still-unused set: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Place N and I in new positions.  
2. Introduce three new consonants that are common enough to give good information.  
3. Be a valid English word.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- “CHINK” – uses C, H, K plus the known letters N and I, and shifts N from 2nd to 3rd and I from 4th to 2nd.  
- “DINER” – but R is already ruled out.  
- “MINCY” – uses M, C, Y plus N and I, and moves N to 2nd (same as before) and I to 3rd; this is less ideal because N stays in a familiar position.  
- “PINKY” – P, I, N, K, Y; N is 3rd (new), I is 2nd (new), and introduces P, K, Y.

“PINKY” seems solid: it repositions both known letters and brings in three new consonants. Let’s lock it in.

Current constraints:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, P, K, Y  
Letters KNOWN to be in the word: I (position 2), N (position 3)  
So the pattern so far is: _ I N _ _

Remaining unused letters (common ones in bold):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, V, W, X, Z  (with B, C, D, F, G, H, M being most frequent)

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 (position 5 is irrelevant because we already have 4 letters).  
We want a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ I N _ _ and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGO – but O is already ruled out.
- CINCH – C, I, N, C, H. All letters allowed, and it fits the pattern.  
- DINGY – D, I, N, G, Y. But Y is ruled out.
- FINCH – F, I, N, C, H. All letters allowed.
- WINCH – W, I, N, C, H. All letters allowed.

Among these, “FINCH” is a good choice because it introduces F and H (two new consonants) and keeps the known letters I and N in their confirmed positions.

Pattern check: F I N C H → positions 2 and 3 are correct, other letters are new.
