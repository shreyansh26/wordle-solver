1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Let's try to place A and E while introducing new letters. Good candidates:
- R _ _ A E (but E cannot be in 5)
- R _ E A _ (but A cannot be in 4)

Looking at possible words:

- R E A D Y (E in 2, A in 3 - valid positions)

- R _ _ E A (but E cannot be in 4)

Looking at possible words:
- R E A D Y (but D and Y weren't tested yet)
- R A I N Y (but N and I are untested, and A would be in position 2 which is invalid)
- R E A D Y (E in 2, A in 3 - valid positions)
- R E A D Y: R(1)=✓, E(2), A(3), D, Y. This seems valid.

But we should check if READY uses any excluded letters (O, S, V, N) - it doesn't. So READY is a valid candidate.

Another option is R E A M S (but S is excluded), or R E A D Y.

I'll go with READY as it tests new letters D and Y while placing E and A in valid positions.

Trying common words that fit:
- REBAC – not a valid English word.
- REACT – valid. Letters: R, E, A, C, T. None are forbidden except C and T haven’t been tested yet.

Between REACT, REBAR, and RECAP, REACT introduces C and T (both untested), while REBAR introduces B (and repeats R). REACT seems slightly more likely to give useful info on new consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (each in some position other than where they were in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in different positions and avoids O and S. Let me think of words that fit:

5. T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word starts with ""RE"".
- Contains A and T.
- A cannot be in position 3 (from A(-) in READY and REACT).
- T cannot be in position 5 (from T(-) in REACT).
- Forbidden letters: O, S, V, N, D, Y, C.

Possible positions for A and T:
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- T must be in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 5).

Let's consider the two cases for T:

Case 1: T in position 3
- Pattern: R E T _ _
- A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Possible words: RETAM (invalid), RETAB (invalid), RETAG (invalid), RETAH (invalid), RETAP (invalid), RETAR (valid but repeats R), RETAS (invalid - S forbidden), RETAT (invalid).
- No valid words here.

Case 2: T in position 4
- Pattern: R E _ T _
- A must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 3 and must be somewhere).
- So the pattern is: R E _ T A
- The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet used and not forbidden. Available consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z.
- Common words fitting this: REBAT (invalid), REFIT (invalid - I not tested but allowed), REGAT (invalid), RELAT (invalid - L allowed), REMAT (invalid), REPAT (invalid), REWAT (invalid).
- Looking carefully, ""RELAT"" is actually ""relate"" without the 'e', but that's 5 letters: R, E, L, A, T. This fits the pattern R E _ T A with L in position 3.

Let me check RELAT:
- Letters: R, E, L, A, T.
- R and E are confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- A is in position 5 (valid since A can't be in 3 but can be in 5).
- T is in position 4 (valid since T can't be in 5 but can be in 4).
- No forbidden letters (O, S, V, N, D, Y, C) are used.
- ""RELAT"" is a valid English word (short for relate).

Thus, the next logical guess is RELAT.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (each in some position other than where they were in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

Possible positions:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in different positions and avoids O and S. Let me think of words that fit:
- EAGLE: Uses E, A, G, L. But G and L weren't tested yet, and we know E can't be in position 5 (but here E is in position 1, which is fine). However, R is missing.
- RATED: Uses R, A, T, E, D. This has R, A, E in new positions (R in 1, A in 2, E in 4). T and D are new letters, but that's okay for a second guess to narrow things down.
- CRANE: Uses C, R, A, N, E. This has R in 2 (but R can't be in 2), so this is invalid.
- RAVEN: Uses R, A, V, E, N. R is in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), E in 4 (new). V and N are new letters, but that's acceptable for gathering more info.

I'll go with RAVEN because it places R, A, E in positions we haven't tested yet and introduces two new consonants (V, N) to see if they're in the word.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RAVEN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - O, S are not in the word.

2. RAVEN → R(✓) A(-) V(x) E(-) N(x)
   - R is in position 1 and is correct (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - V, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- R is fixed in position 1.
- The word contains A and E, but:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, V, N.

We need a 5-letter word starting with R, containing A and E, and avoiding the excluded letters. Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- E can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are excluded).

Let's try to place A and E while introducing new letters. Good candidates:
- R _ _ A E (but E cannot be in 5)
- R _ E A _ (but A cannot be in 4)
- R _ _ E A (but E cannot be in 4)

Looking at possible words:
- R E A D Y (but D and Y weren't tested yet)
- R A I N Y (but N and I are untested, and A would be in position 2 which is invalid)
- R E A D Y (E in 2, A in 3 - valid positions)
- R E A D Y: R(1)=✓, E(2), A(3), D, Y. This seems valid.

But we should check if READY uses any excluded letters (O, S, V, N) - it doesn't. So READY is a valid candidate.

Another option is R E A M S (but S is excluded), or R E A D Y.

I'll go with READY as it tests new letters D and Y while placing E and A in valid positions.

From the new READY feedback:

- E(✓) – now confirmed in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. R is fixed in position 1.
2. E is fixed in position 2.
3. A is somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (it cannot be in 1, 2, 3).
4. Forbidden letters so far: O, S, V, N, D, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “RE”, has A in either position 4 or 5, and uses only letters not yet ruled out. The remaining letters to consider are: A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z (excluding the forbidden ones).

Let’s list possible patterns:
- RE _ A _
- RE _ _ A

Trying common words that fit:
- REBAC – not a valid English word.
- REACT – valid. Letters: R, E, A, C, T. None are forbidden except C and T haven’t been tested yet.
- REBAG – not a word.
- REBAN – N is forbidden.
- REBAR – valid. Letters: R, E, B, A, R. B and R are new, R is allowed to repeat.
- RECAP – valid. Letters: R, E, C, A, P. All new and allowed.

Between REACT, REBAR, and RECAP, REACT introduces C and T (both untested), while REBAR introduces B (and repeats R). REACT seems slightly more likely to give useful info on new consonants.

So I’ll guess REACT.

5. T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of everything we know so far:

- Word pattern: R E _ _ _
- Letters that must appear: A, T
- Letters that cannot appear: O, S, V, N, D, Y, C, L
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from A(-) in AROSE, RAVEN, READY, RELAT)
  – Therefore A must be in position 5.
  – T cannot be in positions 5 (from REACT) or 5 (from RELAT), so T must be in position 3 or 4.

So the word must be:
R E [T or _] [T or _] A

with the remaining letter (position 3 or 4) being a consonant not yet ruled out.

Available consonants (not forbidden and not used): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z.

Case 1: T in position 3 → pattern R E T _ A
   The blank (position 4) must be one of the available consonants.
   Valid English words: RETBA (invalid), RETFA (invalid), RETGA (invalid), RETHA (invalid), RETJA (invalid), RETKA (invalid), RETMA (invalid), RETPA (invalid), RETQA (invalid), RETRA (valid), RETSA (invalid - S forbidden), RETTA (valid), RETVA (invalid).
   From these, RETRA and RETTA are the only valid candidates.

Case 2: T in position 4 → pattern R E _ T A
   The blank (position 3) must be one of the available consonants.
   Valid English words: REBTA (invalid), REF TA (invalid), REGTA (invalid), REHTA (invalid), REMTA (invalid), REP TA (invalid), REPTA (invalid).
   No valid words found in this case.

Therefore, the only valid candidates are RETRA and RETTA.

Between these two:
- RETRA: R, E, T, R, A – uses R twice, which is allowed.
- RETTA: R, E, T, T, A – uses T twice, which is allowed.

Both fit all constraints. However, ""RETTA"" is less common (usually spelled with double T at the end), while ""RETRA"" is a valid but rare variant. The more common word is ""RETTA"" (as in the name Retta), but both are technically correct.

I'll choose RETTA as it's more recognizable.
