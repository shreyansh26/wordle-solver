For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal multiple letters in their correct positions or as present in the word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, R, O, S, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
Good untested consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Good untested vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word covering both vowels and consonants is ideal.  
“UNITY” uses U (vowel), N, I, T, Y – all fresh letters.  
Another candidate is “MOUNT” (but O is already ruled out).  
“BLUNT” is also strong, but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced.

So I’ll go with UNITY.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: N, I, Y.
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains both N and I somewhere among the first four letters.
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, E, U, T).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Possible vowels left: I (already used once), and possibly others, but A, O, E, U are out.

Since we have I and N to place, and we need two more consonants, let’s look for common patterns. A good candidate is “BLIND”:
- Ends with D (but we know Y must be last), so that’s wrong.
Next, “CHINK” – ends with K, not Y.
“MINKY” – ends with Y, contains I and N, but has an M, I, N, K, Y. Let’s check:
- Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are forbidden.
- Contains I, N, Y (with Y in correct spot).
- Common word.

Another option is “PINNY” but double N might not help much.
“MINCY” – uses C which is allowed, but less common.
“MINKY” seems best.

Let me verify: M, I, N, K, Y – all allowed, ends with Y, includes I and N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal multiple letters in their correct positions or as present in the word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, R, O, S, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
Good untested consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Good untested vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word covering both vowels and consonants is ideal.  
“UNITY” uses U (vowel), N, I, T, Y – all fresh letters.  
Another candidate is “MOUNT” (but O is already ruled out).  
“BLUNT” is also strong, but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced.

So I’ll go with UNITY.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: N, I, Y.
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains both N and I somewhere among the first four letters.
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, E, U, T).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Possible vowels left: I (already used once), and possibly others, but A, O, E, U are out.

Since we have I and N to place, and we need two more consonants, let’s look for common patterns. A good candidate is “BLIND”:
- Ends with D (but we know Y must be last), so that’s wrong.
Next, “CHINK” – ends with K, not Y.
“MINKY” – ends with Y, contains I and N, but has an M, I, N, K, Y. Let’s check:
- Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are forbidden.
- Contains I, N, Y (with Y in correct spot).
- Common word.

Another option is “PINNY” but double N might not help much.
“MINCY” – uses C which is allowed, but less common.
“MINKY” seems best.

Let me verify: M, I, N, K, Y – all allowed, ends with Y, includes I and N.

So I’ll guess MINKY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, K, L, B (all marked “x” or already ruled out).

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown)  
I and N (both marked “-” in BLINY), plus Y which is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, with these additional constraints:

- I cannot be in position 3 (BLINY showed I(-) at index 3).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (BLINY showed N(-) at index 4).  

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are still allowed:  
C, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.  
- Uses I and N exactly once each, in positions 1-4.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.  

Possible placements for I and N:
- I in 1 or 2 or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding the forbidden spots).  
- Example patterns:  
  I N _ _ Y  (N in 2)  
  I _ N _ Y  (N in 3)  
  _ I N _ Y  (N in 3)  
  _ N I _ Y  (N in 2, I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3)  
  etc.

Let’s pick a simple pattern: I _ N _ Y  
We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the still-allowed consonants.

Good candidates:  
- I C N D Y → “ICNDY” – not a valid English word.  
- I N N D Y – invalid (N repeated).  
- I N C H Y – “INCHY” – valid (though rare).  
- I N G Y – too short.  
- I N V Y – invalid.  
- I N J Y – invalid.  
- I N P Y – invalid.  
- I N D Y – “INDY” – too short.  

Another pattern: _ I N _ Y  
Need a consonant in position 1 and 4.  
- C I N G Y – “CINGY” – not a word.  
- D I N G Y – “DINGY” – valid word, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  
  – Check constraints:  
    – Ends with Y ✓  
    – Contains I and N ✓  
    – I is in position 2 (allowed) ✓  
    – N is in position 3 (allowed) ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal multiple letters in their correct positions or as present in the word. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding A, R, O, S, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
Good untested consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Good untested vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word covering both vowels and consonants is ideal.  
“UNITY” uses U (vowel), N, I, T, Y – all fresh letters.  
Another candidate is “MOUNT” (but O is already ruled out).  
“BLUNT” is also strong, but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced.

So I’ll go with UNITY.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T.
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown: N, I, Y.
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains both N and I somewhere among the first four letters.
3. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, E, U, T).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Possible vowels left: I (already used once), and possibly others, but A, O, E, U are out.

Since we have I and N to place, and we need two more consonants, let’s look for common patterns. A good candidate is “BLIND”:
- Ends with D (but we know Y must be last), so that’s wrong.
Next, “CHINK” – ends with K, not Y.
“MINKY” – ends with Y, contains I and N, but has an M, I, N, K, Y. Let’s check:
- Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are forbidden.
- Contains I, N, Y (with Y in correct spot).
- Common word.

Another option is “PINNY” but double N might not help much.
“MINCY” – uses C which is allowed, but less common.
“MINKY” seems best.

Let me verify: M, I, N, K, Y – all allowed, ends with Y, includes I and N.

So I’ll guess MINKY.

Current constraints:
1. Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, K.
2. Letters known TO be in the word (positions still unknown): N, I, Y.
3. Y is fixed in the 5th position.
4. I is in the word but not in position 2.
5. N is in the word but not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains I somewhere (not position 2).
- Contains N somewhere (not position 3).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus I, N, Y which are already confirmed).

Possible positions for I: 1, 3, 4.
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 4.

Let’s look for common patterns:
- If I is in position 1: I _ _ _ Y
- If I is in position 3: _ _ I _ Y
- If I is in position 4: _ _ _ I Y

And N must fit into one of the remaining spots.

Candidate words:
- ""PINNY"" – but N is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""BLINY"" – but B, L, I, N, Y: N is in position 4 (valid), I in position 3 (valid). This seems good.
- ""FLING"" – but ends with G, not Y.
- ""CHINY"" – but C, H, I, N, Y: N is in position 4 (valid), I in position 3 (valid). Also good.
- ""DINGY"" – D, I, N, G, Y: N is in position 3 (invalid).

Between BLINY and CHINY, both fit. BLINY uses B and L which are still allowed and common. I'll go with BLINY.

But wait: in BLINY:
- B (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- I (must be in word, not position 2 – here it's position 3, ok)
- N (must be in word, not position 3 – here it's position 4, ok)
- Y (position 5, correct)

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, K, L, B (all marked “x” or already ruled out).

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown)  
I and N (both marked “-” in BLINY), plus Y which is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, with these additional constraints:

- I cannot be in position 3 (BLINY showed I(-) at index 3).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (BLINY showed N(-) at index 4).  

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are still allowed:  
C, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.  
- Uses I and N exactly once each, in positions 1-4.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.  

Possible placements for I and N:
- I in 1 or 2 or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (avoiding the forbidden spots).  
- Example patterns:  
  I N _ _ Y  (N in 2)  
  I _ N _ Y  (N in 3)  
  _ I N _ Y  (N in 3)  
  _ N I _ Y  (N in 2, I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3)  
  etc.

Let’s pick a simple pattern: I _ N _ Y  
We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, chosen from the still-allowed consonants.

Good candidates:  
- I C N D Y → “ICNDY” – not a valid English word.  
- I N N D Y – invalid (N repeated).  
- I N C H Y – “INCHY” – valid (though rare).  
- I N G Y – too short.  
- I N V Y – invalid.  
- I N J Y – invalid.  
- I N P Y – invalid.  
- I N D Y – “INDY” – too short.  

Another pattern: _ I N _ Y  
Need a consonant in position 1 and 4.  
- C I N G Y – “CINGY” – not a word.  
- D I N G Y – “DINGY” – valid word, uses D, I, N, G, Y.  
  – Check constraints:  
    – Ends with Y ✓  
    – Contains I and N ✓  
    – I is in position 2 (allowed) ✓  
    – N is in position 3 (allowed) ✓  
    – Letters D, G, Y are allowed and untested ✓  

“DINGY” satisfies every rule we have so far.

Let’s list everything we know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, K, L, B, D, G (all marked “x” or already ruled out).

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown)  
I and N (both marked “-” in four of the last five guesses), plus Y which is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, with these additional constraints:

- I cannot be in position 2 (DINGY showed I(✓) at index 2)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (BLINY showed I(-) at index 3)  
- N cannot be in position 3 (MINKY showed N(-) at index 3)  
- N cannot be in position 4 (BLINY showed N(-) at index 4)  

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are still allowed:  
C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.  
- Uses I and N exactly once each, in positions 1-4.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.  

Possible placements for I and N:
- I must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).  
- N must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 3 or 4).  

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:

1. I N _ _ Y  
   N is in position 2 (allowed).  
   Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   Example: I N C H Y → “INCHY” (valid word).

2. _ I N _ Y  
   I is in position 2 (invalid, because I cannot be in position 2).  
   Skip.

3. _ N I _ Y  
   I is in position 3 (invalid, because I cannot be in position 3).  
   Skip.

4. _ _ I N Y  
   N is in position 4 (invalid, because N cannot be in position 4).  
   Skip.

5. N I _ _ Y  
   I is in position 2 (invalid).  
   Skip.

6. N _ I _ Y  
   I is in position 3 (invalid).  
   Skip.

7. N _ _ I Y  
   I is in position 4 (allowed).  
   Need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
   Example: N C H I Y → “NCHIY” – not a word.  
   N F I C Y – not a word.  
   N H I C Y – not a word.  
   N P I C Y – not a word.  
   N V I C Y – not a word.  
   N W I C Y – not a word.  
   N Z I C Y – not a word.  

The only viable pattern is #1: I N _ _ Y with allowed consonants for positions 3 and 4.

From the remaining allowed consonants (C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- I N C H Y → “INCHY” (valid)  
- I N C P Y → “INCPY” – invalid  
- I N C V Y → “INC VY” – invalid  
- I N F C Y → “INF C Y” – invalid  
- I N H C Y → “INHCY” – invalid  
- I N J C Y → “INJ C Y” – invalid  
- I N P C Y → “INPCY” – invalid  
- I N V C Y → “INV C Y” – invalid  
- I N W C Y → “INW C Y” – invalid  
- I N Z C Y → “INZ C Y” – invalid  

Only “INCHY” is a valid English word fitting all constraints.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, K, L, B, D, G (all marked “x” or already ruled out).

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown)  
I and N (both marked “-” in four of the last five guesses), plus Y which is fixed at position 5.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, with these additional constraints:

- I cannot be in position 2 (DINGY showed I(✓) at index 2)  
- I cannot be in position 3 (BLINY showed I(-) at index 3)  
- N cannot be in position 3 (MINKY showed N(-) at index 3)  
- N cannot be in position 4 (BLINY showed N(-) at index 4)  

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are still allowed:  
C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.  
- Uses I and N exactly once each, in positions 1-4.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.  

Possible placements for I and N:
- I must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).  
- N must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 3 or 4).  

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:

1. I N _ _ Y  
   N is in position 2 (allowed).  
   Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

5. N I _ _ Y  
   I is in position 2 (invalid).  
   Skip.

6. N _ I _ Y  
   I is in position 3 (invalid).  
   Skip.

7. N _ _ I Y  
   I is in position 4 (allowed).  
   Need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
   Example: N C H I Y → “NCHIY” – not a word.  
   N F I C Y – not a word.  
   N H I C Y – not a word.  
   N P I C Y – not a word.  
   N V I C Y – not a word.  
   N W I C Y – not a word.  
   N Z I C Y – not a word.  

The only viable pattern is #1: I N _ _ Y with allowed consonants for positions 3 and 4.

From the remaining allowed consonants (C, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z), we need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:
- I N C H Y → “INCHY” (valid)  
- I N C P Y → “INCPY” – invalid  
- I N C V Y → “INC VY” – invalid  
- I N F C Y → “INF C Y” – invalid  
- I N H C Y → “INHCY” – invalid  
- I N J C Y → “INJ C Y” – invalid  
- I N P C Y → “INPCY” – invalid  
- I N V C Y → “INV C Y” – invalid  
- I N W C Y → “INW C Y” – invalid  
- I N Z C Y → “INZ C Y” – invalid  

Only “INCHY” is a valid English word fitting all constraints.",Guess 6: INCHY -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) C(x) H(x) Y(✓),FAIL
