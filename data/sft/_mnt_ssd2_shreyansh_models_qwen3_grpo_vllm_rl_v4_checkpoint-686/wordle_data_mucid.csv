For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters in the word and their positions.

None of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word at all. That means I need to completely avoid those letters in my next guess. I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters. 

Good consonants to try next would include R, N, M, P, C, D, H, etc. and good vowels would be I, O, U. 

A common word that avoids all of S, L, A, T, E is ""CRONY"". It uses:
- C (common consonant)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y.
- The letter C is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).

So the secret word:
- Contains C exactly once.
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y.
- Has 5 letters total.

Remaining common letters to try: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has C somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""CHIMP"":
- C (must be present, placed in position 1 - but since feedback said C is wrong position, this is actually position 1 again, which is invalid. Let me rethink.)

Wait - C was in position 1 in CRONY and marked as wrong position, so C cannot be in position 1. So in my next guess, C must be in positions 2-5.

Let me try ""CHICK"":
- C in position 1 again - no, that's same as before. Not allowed.

Better: ""MUCKS"" - but S is already ruled out.

Another approach: pick a word with C in positions 2-5 and use other common letters not yet tried.

""PIKUM"" - but U and M are okay, but this is 5 letters.

Wait, let's list possible letters left:
Allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding the ruled-out ones).

I need a common word. Let's try ""CHUCK"":
- C in position 1 - no, same issue.

""CHUNK"" - N is ruled out.

""CHIDE"" - E is ruled out.

""CHIPS"" - S is ruled out.

""CHILI"" - L is ruled out.

""CHINK"" - N is ruled out.

""CHUCK"" - U is okay, but N is ruled out.

""CHUMP"" - P, U, M, P - but P is okay, U is okay, M is okay, but this has P twice.

""CHUMP"" - but U is okay, M is okay, P is okay, H is okay.

But let's check: C must be present and not in position 1. So positions 2-5 for C.

Let me try ""DUMPY"" - but Y is ruled out.

""QUICK"" - Q, U, I, C, K - but C is in position 4 here, which is allowed (since C was in position 1 before and marked wrong position).

But Q is less common.

""PUCKY"" - Y is ruled out.

""KICKS"" - S is ruled out.

""VICAR"" - R is ruled out.

""VICID"" - D is okay, but I is okay, C is in position 3 (allowed), but V is okay.

But ""VICID"" might not be a common word.

Another common word: ""MUCKY"" - Y is ruled out.

""JUMPY"" - Y is ruled out.

""QUIET"" - E, T are ruled out.

""QUIPU"" - Q, U, I, P, U - but P is okay, U is okay, I is okay, Q is okay.

Let’s summarize the constraints we now have:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y, Q, K

Letters that **are** in the word but in the wrong positions so far:
- U – must appear somewhere (and was in the correct position in QUICK, so it must be in position 2).
- I – must appear somewhere (but not in position 3).
- C – must appear somewhere (but not in position 4).

So the secret word looks like:  
_ U _ _ _   (U is fixed in position 2)  
and must contain both I and C somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5), with C not in position 4.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, M, P, V, W, X, Z, plus I and C.

We need a common 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 2.
- Contains both I and C somewhere else.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- “BUICS” – invalid (S is out).
- “DUICC” – invalid (double C and not a word).
- “FUMIC” – invalid (not common).
- “HUMIC” – valid and common (relating to soil organic matter).

Check HUMIC:
- H, U, M, I, C – all letters allowed.
- U is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- I and C are present and not in previously marked wrong positions (I not in 3, C not in 4).
- This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is HUMIC.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters in the word and their positions.

None of the letters S, L, A, T, or E are in the secret word at all. That means I need to completely avoid those letters in my next guess. I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters. 

Good consonants to try next would include R, N, M, P, C, D, H, etc. and good vowels would be I, O, U. 

A common word that avoids all of S, L, A, T, E is ""CRONY"". It uses:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes useful in word games)

This should give me new information about other letters.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y.
- The letter C is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).

So the secret word:
- Contains C exactly once.
- Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y.
- Has 5 letters total.

Remaining common letters to try: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has C somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""CHIMP"":
- C (must be present, placed in position 1 - but since feedback said C is wrong position, this is actually position 1 again, which is invalid. Let me rethink.)

Wait - C was in position 1 in CRONY and marked as wrong position, so C cannot be in position 1. So in my next guess, C must be in positions 2-5.

Let me try ""CHICK"":
- C in position 1 again - no, that's same as before. Not allowed.

Better: ""MUCKS"" - but S is already ruled out.

Another approach: pick a word with C in positions 2-5 and use other common letters not yet tried.

""PIKUM"" - but U and M are okay, but this is 5 letters.

Wait, let's list possible letters left:
Allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding the ruled-out ones).

I need a common word. Let's try ""CHUCK"":
- C in position 1 - no, same issue.

""CHUNK"" - N is ruled out.

""CHIDE"" - E is ruled out.

""CHIPS"" - S is ruled out.

""CHILI"" - L is ruled out.

""CHINK"" - N is ruled out.

""CHUCK"" - U is okay, but N is ruled out.

""CHUMP"" - P, U, M, P - but P is okay, U is okay, M is okay, but this has P twice.

""CHUMP"" - but U is okay, M is okay, P is okay, H is okay.

But let's check: C must be present and not in position 1. So positions 2-5 for C.

Let me try ""DUMPY"" - but Y is ruled out.

""QUICK"" - Q, U, I, C, K - but C is in position 4 here, which is allowed (since C was in position 1 before and marked wrong position).

But Q is less common.

""PUCKY"" - Y is ruled out.

""KICKS"" - S is ruled out.

""VICAR"" - R is ruled out.

""VICID"" - D is okay, but I is okay, C is in position 3 (allowed), but V is okay.

But ""VICID"" might not be a common word.

Another common word: ""MUCKY"" - Y is ruled out.

""JUMPY"" - Y is ruled out.

""QUIET"" - E, T are ruled out.

""QUIPU"" - Q, U, I, P, U - but P is okay, U is okay, I is okay, Q is okay.

But C must be present.

Let me try ""QUICK"" - Q, U, I, C, K - C is in position 4 (allowed), and all letters are allowed.

This seems like the best option among common words.

From the latest feedback:

1. U is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
2. I is confirmed in position 4 (✓).
3. C is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).
4. M is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
5. H is not in the word (x).

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 1: unknown, must be one of the remaining letters (not yet ruled out).
- Position 2: U (fixed).
- Position 3: unknown, must be one of the remaining letters (not M, because M is in the word but not here).
- Position 4: I (fixed).
- Position 5: unknown, must be one of the remaining letters (and C must be here or earlier, but not in 5).

Letters we know are in the word: C, M, I, U.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, N, Y, Q, K, H.

So the remaining letters available are: B, D, F, G, J, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need to place C and M in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since position 2 and 4 are fixed), with the constraints:
- C cannot be in position 5 (from feedback), so C must be in position 1 or 3.
- M cannot be in position 3 (from feedback), so M must be in position 1 or 5.

Possible arrangements:
1. C in 1, M in 5: C U _ I M
2. C in 3, M in 1: M U C I _

But position 3 must be a letter not yet used and not M (since M is in 1 in this case). Similarly, position 5 must be a letter not yet used.

Looking at the possible words:
- C U _ I M: The blank must be a letter from the remaining set (B, D, F, G, J, P, V, W, X, Z). The word ""CUBIM"" is not valid. ""CUDIM"" is not a word. ""CUFIM"" is not a word. ""CUGIM"" is not a word. ""CUPIM"" is not a word. ""CUVIM"" is not a word. ""CUXIM"" is not a word. ""CUZIM"" is not a word. So this seems invalid.
- M U C I _: The blank must be a letter from the remaining set. The word ""MUCID"" is not a word. ""MUCIF"" is not a word. ""MUCIG"" is not a word. ""MUCIP"" is not a word. ""MUCIV"" is not a word. ""MUCIZ"" is not a word. So this seems invalid.

Wait, maybe I missed other possibilities. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. Let me think of words that fit the pattern _ U _ I _ with U in position 2 and I in position 4, and contain both C and M, with C not in position 5 and M not in position 3.

Possible valid words:
- ""BUMPI"" – but P is okay, but this doesn't have C.
- ""DUMPY"" – Y is out.
- ""FUMIC"" – but F is okay, U is 2, M is 3 (but M can't be in 3), so invalid.
- ""JUMPY"" – Y is out.
- ""PUMIC"" – but P is okay, U is 2, M is 3 (invalid), so no.
- ""VUMIC"" – V is okay, but M is 3 (invalid).
- ""WUMIC"" – same issue.

Hmm, seems like most words with U in 2 and I in 4 and containing M and C have M in position 3, which is invalid. Let me think differently.

The word must contain C and M, with:
- C not in position 5.
- M not in position 3.
- U in position 2.
- I in position 4.

So possible positions:
- C could be in 1 or 3.
- M could be in 1 or 5.

Case 1: C in 1, M in 5 → C U _ I M
The blank must be a letter not yet used (from B, D, F, G, J, P, V, W, X, Z). The word must be valid. ""CUBIM"" is not valid. ""CUDIM"" is not valid. ""CUFIM"" is not valid. ""CUGIM"" is not valid. ""CUPIM"" is not valid. ""CUVIM"" is not valid. ""CUXIM"" is not valid. ""CUZIM"" is not valid. So no valid word here.

Case 2: C in 3, M in 1 → M U C I _
The blank must be a letter not yet used. The word must be valid. ""MUCID"" is not a word. ""MUCIF"" is not a word. ""MUCIG"" is not a word. ""MUCIP"" is not a word. ""MUCIV"" is not a word. ""MUCIZ"" is not a word. So no valid word here.

Case 3: C in 3, M in 5 → _ U C I M
The blank must be a letter not yet used. The word must be valid. ""BUCIM"" is not valid. ""DUCIM"" is not valid. ""FUCIM"" is not valid. ""GUCIM"" is not valid. ""JUCIM"" is not valid. ""PUCIM"" is not valid. ""VUCIM"" is not valid. ""WUCIM"" is not valid. ""XUCIM"" is not valid. ""ZUCIM"" is not valid. So no valid word here.

Case 4: C in 1, M in 3 → C U M I _
But M cannot be in position 3 (from feedback), so this is invalid.

Case 5: C in 1, M in 5 (already considered in Case 1).

Case 6: C in 5 is invalid (from feedback), so no.

Wait, maybe I missed other words. Let me think of words with U in 2 and I in 4, containing C and M, with C not in 5 and M not in 3.

Another approach: list all valid 5-letter words with U in position 2 and I in position 4, then filter.

Valid words with U in 2 and I in 4:
- ""BUIUC"" – invalid (not a word).
- ""DUIIC"" – invalid.
- ""FUIIC"" – invalid.
- ""GUMIC"" – G is okay, U is 2, M is 3 (invalid), so no.
- ""JUMPY"" – Y is out.
- ""PUMIC"" – M is 3 (invalid).
- ""VUMIC"" – M is 3 (invalid).
- ""WUMIC"" – M is 3 (invalid).
- ""ZUMIC"" – M is 3 (invalid).

Hmm, seems like most words with U in 2 and I in 4 and containing M have M in position 3. Let me check if there are any other words.

Another possibility: ""BUMPI"" – but this doesn't have C.

Wait, ""FUMIC"" has F, U, M, I, C. But M is in position 3, which is invalid (from feedback: M is in word but wrong position, and in HUMIC it was in position 3 and marked -, so M cannot be in 3). So ""FUMIC"" is invalid.

""JUMIC"" – not a word.

""VUMIC"" – not a word.

""WUMIC"" – not a word.

""ZUMIC"" – not a word.

""PUMIC"" – not a word.

""GUMIC"" – not a word.

""DUMIC"" – not a word.

""BUMIC"" – not a word.

""CUMIC"" – not a word.

""CUMIC"" – not a word.

""CURIC"" – R is out.

""CUPIC"" – not a word.

""CUVIC"" – not a word.

""CUZIC"" – not a word.

It seems like there are no valid common words fitting the constraints. This suggests I might have missed something.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From HUMIC:
- H(x) – H not in word.
- U(✓) – U in position 2 (fixed).
- M(-) – M is in word but not in position 3.
- I(✓) – I in position 4 (fixed).
- C(-) – C is in word but not in position 5.

So the word must have:
- U in position 2.
- I in position 4.
- Contain both M and C somewhere else.
- C not in position 5.
- M not in position 3.

Possible positions:
- C can be in 1 or 3.
- M can be in 1 or 5.

So possible patterns:
1. C U _ I M
2. _ U C I M
3. M U C I _

But none of these seem to form valid words with remaining letters.

Wait, let me think of ""BUMPI"" – but this doesn't have C.

Another approach: maybe the word is ""MUCID"" – but this is a valid word (relating to mucous membranes), and let's check:
- M U C I D
- Positions: 1-M, 2-U, 3-C, 4-I, 5-D
- U is in 2 (✓)
- I is in 4 (✓)
- C is in 3 (allowed, since C was in 4 before and marked -, so 3 is new)
- M is in 1 (allowed, since M was in 3 before and marked -, so 1 is new)
- D is allowed (not ruled out)
- All letters are allowed.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: M, U, C, I, D
- All letters are from allowed set.
- U in 2, I in 4 (✓)
- C is in 3 (not 4 or 5, so allowed)
- M is in 1 (not 3, so allowed)
- No disallowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is MUCID.
