### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- E: ✓ → correct in 5th position

So the pattern is: _ R O _ E

Possible candidates: BROKE, CRORE, DROVE, GROPE, PROBE, TROPE, etc.

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters.

We now have:

Pattern: C R O _ E  
Only the 4th letter is unknown.

Letters already eliminated: A, S, B, K, D, V, T, P, N

Available consonants for position 4: F, G, H, L, M, W, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit C R O _ E:
- CRONE – already tried, N is wrong  
- CROME – uses M (still allowed)  
- CROZE – uses Z (not common, but valid)  
- CROWE – not a standard word  
- CROPE – uses P (already eliminated)  

The only remaining common word is **CROME** (short for cromer, a type of steel or the Cromerian cormorant).  
Since M has not been eliminated, CROME is the logical next guess.
