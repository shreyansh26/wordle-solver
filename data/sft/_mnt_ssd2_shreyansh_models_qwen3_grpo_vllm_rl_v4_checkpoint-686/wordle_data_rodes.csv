For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels, and avoid repeating letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), with no repeated letters. This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is not in position 4

So we know:

- We still need to find the fifth letter, which must be a new letter not yet tested (since A is out, and R, O, S, E are already known to be present but in wrong positions).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R, O, S, E in new positions
2. Introduce a new common letter not yet tested
3. Avoid repeating any letter in the same position as before

Possible new letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's rearrange R, O, S, E and add a new common consonant. A strong candidate is ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter

The feedback from Guess 3 tells us that ""OSEL R"" is not a valid 5-letter word. We need to rearrange R, O, S, E and add a new letter while keeping the word valid.

Let's list the constraints again:
- Must contain R, O, S, E (each in positions not yet ruled out).
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot contain A, T (and we've now ruled out positions for each of R, O, S, E).

Current position bans:
R: not 2, 3
O: not 2, 3
S: not 1, 4
E: not 4, 5

We need a new letter; common unused ones are L, N, C, D, B, G, M, P.

A valid word that uses R, O, S, E plus a new letter while respecting the position bans is ""ROSES"" – but it repeats S, and we don't know if repeats are allowed. The rules don't forbid repeats, but we want to test new letters.

Another option: ""ROSES"" is invalid (S twice and position 4 banned for S).

Next option: ""SORES"" – same issue.

""RESON"" – uses R, E, S, O, N. Check positions:
R:1 (allowed), E:2 (allowed), S:3 (allowed), O:4 (allowed), N:5 (new). This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is not in position 2
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is not in position 3
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is not in position 4
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is not in position 5

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, S, E (but none of A, R, O, S, E are in their original positions)
- We still need to find the fifth letter, which must be a new letter not yet tested (since A is out, and R, O, S, E are already known to be present but in wrong positions).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R, O, S, E in new positions
2. Introduce a new common letter not yet tested
3. Avoid repeating any letter in the same position as before

Possible new letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's rearrange R, O, S, E and add a new common consonant. A strong candidate is ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter
- O moves from 3 to 2
- R moves from 2 to 3
- E moves from 5 to 4

This tests the new letter T and repositions all known letters correctly.

Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but always in wrong positions so far):
- R – not in position 2 or 3
- O – not in position 3 or 2
- S – not in position 4 or 1
- E – not in position 5 or 4

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, T

So the word must contain R, O, S, E plus one more letter that has not been tried yet.  
Common unused consonants so far: L, N, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.

We need to place R, O, S, E in positions they have NOT been ruled out of and add a new letter.

Positions ruled out:
- R: 2, 3
- O: 2, 3
- S: 1, 4
- E: 4, 5

Good candidate positions for each:
- R: 1, 4, 5
- O: 1, 4, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- E: 1, 2, 3

A quick arrangement that satisfies all constraints and introduces a new common letter (L) is:

E R O S L → but this repeats no forbidden positions and uses L.

Wait, let’s check positions:
E in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden) – no good.

Try another: S O R E L
S in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (forbidden) – no.

Try: O S E R L
O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), L new – looks good.

This uses all four known letters in allowed positions plus the new letter L.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels, and avoid repeating letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), with no repeated letters. This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a balanced mix of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is not in position 2
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is not in position 3
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is not in position 4
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is not in position 5

So we know:
- The word contains R, O, S, E (but none of A, R, O, S, E are in their original positions)
- We still need to find the fifth letter, which must be a new letter not yet tested (since A is out, and R, O, S, E are already known to be present but in wrong positions).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep R, O, S, E in new positions
2. Introduce a new common letter not yet tested
3. Avoid repeating any letter in the same position as before

Possible new letters to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's rearrange R, O, S, E and add a new common consonant. A strong candidate is ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter
- O moves from 3 to 2
- R moves from 2 to 3
- E moves from 5 to 4

This tests the new letter T and repositions all known letters correctly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but always in wrong positions so far):
- R – not in position 2 or 3
- O – not in position 3 or 2
- S – not in position 4 or 1
- E – not in position 5 or 4

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- A, T

So the word must contain R, O, S, E plus one more letter that has not been tried yet.  
Common unused consonants so far: L, N, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.

We need to place R, O, S, E in positions they have NOT been ruled out of and add a new letter.

Positions ruled out:
- R: 2, 3
- O: 2, 3
- S: 1, 4
- E: 4, 5

Good candidate positions for each:
- R: 1, 4, 5
- O: 1, 4, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- E: 1, 2, 3

A quick arrangement that satisfies all constraints and introduces a new common letter (L) is:

E R O S L → but this repeats no forbidden positions and uses L.

Wait, let’s check positions:
E in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden) – no good.

Try another: S O R E L
S in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (forbidden) – no.

Try: O S E R L
O in 1 (allowed), S in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), L new – looks good.

This uses all four known letters in allowed positions plus the new letter L.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)
Guess 3: OSEL R -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from Guess 3 tells us that ""OSEL R"" is not a valid 5-letter word. We need to rearrange R, O, S, E and add a new letter while keeping the word valid.

Let's list the constraints again:
- Must contain R, O, S, E (each in positions not yet ruled out).
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- Cannot contain A, T (and we've now ruled out positions for each of R, O, S, E).

Current position bans:
R: not 2, 3
O: not 2, 3
S: not 1, 4
E: not 4, 5

We need a new letter; common unused ones are L, N, C, D, B, G, M, P.

A valid word that uses R, O, S, E plus a new letter while respecting the position bans is ""ROSES"" – but it repeats S, and we don't know if repeats are allowed. The rules don't forbid repeats, but we want to test new letters.

Another option: ""ROSES"" is invalid (S twice and position 4 banned for S).

Next option: ""SORES"" – same issue.

""RESON"" – uses R, E, S, O, N. Check positions:
R:1 (allowed), E:2 (allowed), S:3 (allowed), O:4 (allowed), N:5 (new). This seems valid.

""RESON"" is a valid 5-letter word, uses all four known letters in allowed positions, and introduces N.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STORE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) R(-) E(-)

Now we have:

- R is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- N is NOT in the word (x).

Letters known to be in the word: R (fixed at 1), E, S, O.
Letters known NOT in the word: A, T, N.

So the pattern is: R _ _ _ _

We still need one more letter. Common unused letters: L, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.

Constraints on remaining letters:
- E cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 3.
- O cannot be in position 4.

Let's try to place E, S, O in the remaining positions while introducing a new letter.

Possible positions:
2: cannot be E, could be S or O or new letter.
3: cannot be S, could be E or O or new letter.
4: cannot be O, could be E or S or new letter.
5: no restrictions yet.

A valid word that fits: R O S E L – but this has L at 5, and we need to check positions:
R:1 (fixed), O:2 (allowed), S:3 (not allowed – banned), so invalid.

Next: R E S O L – but E is in position 2 (banned).

Next: R O E S L – check positions:
R:1 (fixed), O:2 (allowed), E:3 (allowed), S:4 (allowed), L:5 (new). This seems valid.

""ROE SL"" is not a word, but ""ROESL"" is not valid. Need a real word.

Another option: R O S E D – but S is in position 3 (banned).

Next: R O E S L – not a word.

Next: R E S O L – E in position 2 (banned).

Next: R O L E S – check positions:
R:1 (fixed), O:2 (allowed), L:3 (new), E:4 (allowed), S:5 (allowed). This is a valid word ""ROLE S"" – but ""ROLE S"" is not a word.

Wait, ""ROLES"" is a valid word (plural of role). Let's check:
R:1 (fixed), O:2 (allowed), L:3 (new), E:4 (allowed), S:5 (allowed). This fits all constraints.
