Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 2: TRIES  
T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(✓)

What we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: R, S, E  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  

Positions we can rule out for each known letter:

- R: cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S: cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2)  
- E: cannot be in position 5 (from guess 1) but is confirmed in position 4 (from guess 2)

So the word has:
- E in position 4  
- R somewhere except position 2  
- S somewhere except positions 4 or 5  

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good candidates to try next are N, L, C, D, U, Y.

A word that uses all three known letters in allowable positions and adds new common letters is “CRANE”, but A is ruled out.  
“SENOR” is 5 letters but has O (ruled out).  
“NERVE” uses N, V, but only gives us one new consonant.  
“CREST” has T (ruled out).  
“CRUSE” has U and C, but only one new vowel.

A better choice is “NERVE”:
- N (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 2)  
- R (known, position 3)  
- V (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 5)  

This places E in position 5, which we know is invalid (E is confirmed in position 4). So “NERVE” is wrong.

Correct placement: E is in position 4. So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

We need R and S in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but S cannot be in 5). So S must be in 1 or 3, R must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).

Try “SPEAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SPEND” – D is new, but N is also new.  
“SPERM” – M is new, but R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“SURE” is only 4 letters.  
“SCRUB” – B is new, but C and U are new.  

A valid 5-letter word that fits: “SCRUB”  
But we already have E in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, we need E in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ E _

We need R and S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but R cannot be in 2, S cannot be in 4 or 5).

Let’s try “SURGE”:
- S in 1 (allowed)

But we already have E in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, we need E in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ E _

We need R and S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but R cannot be in 2, S cannot be in 4 or 5).

Let’s try “SURGE”:
- S in 1 (allowed)  
- U (new vowel)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- G (new consonant)  
- E in 4 (correct position)  

This uses all known constraints and tests new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Known letters that are in the word (and their positions are still unknown):
- R (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)
- S (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)
- E (must be in position 4)

Known letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, U, G

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions for R and S:
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is already E, so R must be in 1 or 5.
- S can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need to test remaining common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: N, L, C, D, Y, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Let’s try R in position 1. Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Possible: R S _ E _ → but then we need a 3rd letter. “R S N E _” → “RSNE_” is not a word.  
“R S C E _” → “RSC_E” – not valid.

Try S in position 2: R S _ E _ → “R S N E _” – not valid.  
“R S C E _” – not valid.

Try S in position 3: R _ S E _ → “R N S E _” – not valid.

Alternative: R in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Then S must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Try S in 1: S _ _ E R → “S N E E R” – valid word? “SNEER” – yes.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: allowed (S not excluded from 1)  
- N: new letter  
- E in 4: correct  
- R in 5: allowed (R not excluded from 5)  

This fits all constraints and tests new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: x → not in the word  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (but none of A or O).  
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.  

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, S, E in different positions.  
2. Adds new common consonants and vowels to test.  
3. Avoids A and O since they’re ruled out.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)  
- I (new vowel)  
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)  
- S (known to be in word, now in position 5)  

This tests new letters while repositioning the known ones.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 2: TRIES  
T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(✓)

What we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: R, S, E  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  

Positions we can rule out for each known letter:

- R: cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S: cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2)  
- E: cannot be in position 5 (from guess 1) but is confirmed in position 4 (from guess 2)

So the word has:
- E in position 4  
- R somewhere except position 2  
- S somewhere except positions 4 or 5  

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good candidates to try next are N, L, C, D, U, Y.

A word that uses all three known letters in allowable positions and adds new common letters is “CRANE”, but A is ruled out.  
“SENOR” is 5 letters but has O (ruled out).  
“NERVE” uses N, V, but only gives us one new consonant.  
“CREST” has T (ruled out).  
“CRUSE” has U and C, but only one new vowel.

A better choice is “NERVE”:
- N (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 2)  
- R (known, position 3)  
- V (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 5)  

This places E in position 5, which we know is invalid (E is confirmed in position 4). So “NERVE” is wrong.

Correct placement: E is in position 4. So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

We need R and S in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but S cannot be in 5). So S must be in 1 or 3, R must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).

Try “SPEAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SPEND” – D is new, but N is also new.  
“SPERM” – M is new, but R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“SURE” is only 4 letters.  
“SCRUB” – B is new, but C and U are new.  

A valid 5-letter word that fits: “SCRUB”  
But we already have E in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, we need E in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ E _

We need R and S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but R cannot be in 2, S cannot be in 4 or 5).

Let’s try “SURGE”:
- S in 1 (allowed)  
- U (new vowel)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- G (new consonant)  
- E in 4 (correct position)  

This uses all known constraints and tests new letters.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Known letters that are in the word:
- E (must be in position 4)
- R (must be somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5)
- S (must be somewhere, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5)

Known letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, U, G, N

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions for R and S:
- R can only be in position 1 (since 2,3,5 are excluded and 4 is E)
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are excluded)

Thus the word must be: R _ _ E _

With S in either position 2 or 3.

Option 1: S in position 2 → R S _ E _
Option 2: S in position 3 → R _ S E _

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no A,O,T,I,U,G,N).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try option 1: R S _ E _

Possible: R S C E _ → ""RSC_E"" – not valid.
R S D E _ → ""RSD_E"" – not valid.
R S L E _ → ""R S L E _"" – not valid.

Option 2: R _ S E _

Possible: R C S E _ → ""R C S E _"" – not valid.
R D S E _ → ""R D S E _"" – not valid.
R P S E _ → ""R P S E _"" – not valid.

Wait, we need to think of actual words.

Looking at R _ S E _:
- R C S E _ → no
- R D S E _ → no
- R P S E _ → no

Looking at R S _ E _:
- R S C E _ → no
- R S D E _ → no
- R S L E _ → no

Let me think of valid words ending in E with R and S somewhere.

Actually, the pattern R _ S E _ is more promising. Let's try:

R C S E _ → no
R D S E _ → no
R P S E _ → no

Wait, let's try R E S E _ – but E is already in position 4.

Actually, let's think of words like ""REXES"" but X is not tested yet, but we have no info on X.

But we have to avoid all ruled out letters.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words with E in position 4, R in position 1, and S in position 2 or 3, using only allowed letters.

Valid word: R S C E _ – no
Valid word: R S P E _ – no
Valid word: R S L E _ – no

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""REVER"" but that has V which is untested, but R is already in position 1 and E in 4.

But ""REVER"" has E in position 2 and 4, which might be possible.

Check constraints:
- R in 1: allowed
- E in 2: not yet ruled out (only position 4 is confirmed)
- V: new letter
- E in 4: confirmed
- R in 5: allowed (R not excluded from 5)

This seems valid.

But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another word: ""R E S E R"" – but that's 6 letters.

""R E S E T"" – T is ruled out.

""R E S E N"" – N is ruled out.

""R E S E C"" – C is allowed.

""RESEC"" – not a valid English word.

""R E S E R"" – not valid.

""R E S E T"" – T is out.

""R E S E A"" – A is out.

""R E S E D"" – D is allowed, word ""RESED"" – not valid.

""R E S E R"" – not valid.

""R E S E T"" – T is out.

Hmm, seems like ""REVER"" is the closest valid word fitting the pattern.

But let's check ""REVER"":
- R in 1: allowed
- E in 2: allowed (not yet ruled out)
- V: new letter
- E in 4: confirmed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A: x → not in the word  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- The word contains R, S, E (but none of A or O).  
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.  

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R, S, E in different positions.  
2. Adds new common consonants and vowels to test.  
3. Avoids A and O since they’re ruled out.

A good candidate is “TRIES”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)  
- I (new vowel)  
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)  
- S (known to be in word, now in position 5)  

This tests new letters while repositioning the known ones.

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 2: TRIES  
T(x) R(-) I(-) E(✓) S(✓)

What we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word: R, S, E  
Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, O, T, I  

Positions we can rule out for each known letter:

- R: cannot be in position 2 (from both guesses)  
- S: cannot be in position 4 (from guess 1) and cannot be in position 5 (from guess 2)  
- E: cannot be in position 5 (from guess 1) but is confirmed in position 4 (from guess 2)

So the word has:
- E in position 4  
- R somewhere except position 2  
- S somewhere except positions 4 or 5  

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Good candidates to try next are N, L, C, D, U, Y.

A word that uses all three known letters in allowable positions and adds new common letters is “CRANE”, but A is ruled out.  
“SENOR” is 5 letters but has O (ruled out).  
“NERVE” uses N, V, but only gives us one new consonant.  
“CREST” has T (ruled out).  
“CRUSE” has U and C, but only one new vowel.

A better choice is “NERVE”:
- N (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 2)  
- R (known, position 3)  
- V (new consonant)  
- E (known, position 5)  

This places E in position 5, which we know is invalid (E is confirmed in position 4). So “NERVE” is wrong.

Correct placement: E is in position 4. So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

We need R and S in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but S cannot be in 5). So S must be in 1 or 3, R must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).

Try “SPEAR” – A is ruled out.  
“SPEND” – D is new, but N is also new.  
“SPERM” – M is new, but R is in position 2 (invalid).  
“SURE” is only 4 letters.  
“SCRUB” – B is new, but C and U are new.  

A valid 5-letter word that fits: “SCRUB”  
But we already have E in position 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, we need E in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ E _

We need R and S somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but R cannot be in 2, S cannot be in 4 or 5).

Let’s try “SURGE”:
- S in 1 (allowed)  
- U (new vowel)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- G (new consonant)  
- E in 4 (correct position)  

This uses all known constraints and tests new letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Known letters that are in the word (and their positions are still unknown):
- R (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)
- S (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)
- E (must be in position 4)

Known letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, U, G

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions for R and S:
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is already E, so R must be in 1 or 5.
- S can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We need to test remaining common consonants and vowels. Good candidates: N, L, C, D, Y, etc.

Possible words that fit:
- If R is in position 1: R _ _ E _
- If R is in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Let’s try R in position 1. Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Possible: R S _ E _ → but then we need a 3rd letter. “R S N E _” → “RSNE_” is not a word.  
“R S C E _” → “RSC_E” – not valid.

Try S in position 2: R S _ E _ → “R S N E _” – not valid.  
“R S C E _” – not valid.

Try S in position 3: R _ S E _ → “R N S E _” – not valid.

Alternative: R in position 5: _ _ _ E R

Then S must be in 1, 2, or 3.

Try S in 1: S _ _ E R → “S N E E R” – valid word? “SNEER” – yes.

Check constraints:
- S in 1: allowed (S not excluded from 1)  
- N: new letter  
- E in 4: correct  
- R in 5: allowed (R not excluded from 5)  

This fits all constraints and tests new letters.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Known letters that are in the word:
- E (must be in position 4)
- R (must be somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5)
- S (must be somewhere, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5)

Known letters that are NOT in the word:
A, O, T, I, U, G, N

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E _

Positions for R and S:
- R can only be in position 1 (since 2,3,5 are excluded and 4 is E)
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 (since 1,4,5 are excluded)

Thus the word must be: R _ _ E _

With S in either position 2 or 3.

Option 1: S in position 2 → R S _ E _
Option 2: S in position 3 → R _ S E _

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting these patterns, using only letters not yet ruled out (no A,O,T,I,U,G,N).

Common remaining consonants: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try option 1: R S _ E _

Possible: R S C E _ → ""RSC_E"" – not valid.
R S D E _ → ""RSD_E"" – not valid.
R S L E _ → ""R S L E _"" – not valid.

Option 2: R _ S E _

Possible: R C S E _ → ""R C S E _"" – not valid.
R D S E _ → ""R D S E _"" – not valid.
R P S E _ → ""R P S E _"" – not valid.

Wait, we need to think of actual words.

Looking at R _ S E _:
- R C S E _ → no
- R D S E _ → no
- R P S E _ → no

Looking at R S _ E _:
- R S C E _ → no
- R S D E _ → no
- R S L E _ → no

Let me think of valid words ending in E with R and S somewhere.

Actually, the pattern R _ S E _ is more promising. Let's try:

R C S E _ → no
R D S E _ → no
R P S E _ → no

Wait, let's try R E S E _ – but E is already in position 4.

Actually, let's think of words like ""REXES"" but X is not tested yet, but we have no info on X.

But we have to avoid all ruled out letters.

Another approach: list possible 5-letter words with E in position 4, R in position 1, and S in position 2 or 3, using only allowed letters.

Valid word: R S C E _ – no
Valid word: R S P E _ – no
Valid word: R S L E _ – no

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word is ""REVER"" but that has V which is untested, but R is already in position 1 and E in 4.

But ""REVER"" has E in position 2 and 4, which might be possible.

Check constraints:
- R in 1: allowed
- E in 2: not yet ruled out (only position 4 is confirmed)
- V: new letter
- E in 4: confirmed
- R in 5: allowed (R not excluded from 5)

This seems valid.

But let's see if there's a better choice.

Another word: ""R E S E R"" – but that's 6 letters.

""R E S E T"" – T is ruled out.

""R E S E N"" – N is ruled out.

""R E S E C"" – C is allowed.

""RESEC"" – not a valid English word.

""R E S E R"" – not valid.

""R E S E T"" – T is out.

""R E S E A"" – A is out.

""R E S E D"" – D is allowed, word ""RESED"" – not valid.

""R E S E R"" – not valid.

""R E S E T"" – T is out.

Hmm, seems like ""REVER"" is the closest valid word fitting the pattern.

But let's check ""REVER"":
- R in 1: allowed
- E in 2: allowed (not yet ruled out)
- V: new letter
- E in 4: confirmed
- R in 5: allowed

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let’s list everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are in the word and their exact positions:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 4 (✓)

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (already fixed in position 1, so none left)
- S (must be in the word, but none of positions 1,2,3,4,5 are confirmed for it; however, from earlier feedback we have:
  – S cannot be in positions 1,4,5 (from guesses 1,4,5) and cannot be in 3 (from guess 3 SURGE where S was in position 1 and got “-”, so S is not in 1; also from guess 4 SNEER S was in 1 and got “-”, so S is not in 1. From guess 3 SURGE S was in 1 and got “-”, so S is not in 1. From guess 1 AROSE S was in 4 and got “-”, so S is not in 4. From guess 2 TRIES S was in 5 and got “✓”, so S is in 5. Wait, let's re-examine:

Re-examining S:
- Guess 1 AROSE: S in 4 → “-” → S is in word but not in 4
- Guess 2 TRIES: S in 5 → “✓” → S is in 5
- Guess 3 SURGE: S in 1 → “-” → S is in word but not in 1
- Guess 4 SNEER: S in 1 → “-” → S is in word but not in 1 (confirms above)
- Guess 5 REVER: no S at all, so S must be in 5 (from TRIES feedback)

Thus S is definitely in position 5.

So current word structure:
R _ _ E S

Letters not in the word at all:
A, O, T, I, U, G, N, V

Remaining letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from allowed letters, forming a valid English word.

Possible words:
R C _ E S → “R C H E S” → “RCHES” – not valid
R C L E S → “R C L E S” – not valid
R D _ E S → “R D _ E S” – “R D A E S” – A is out
R D I E S – I is out
R D U E S – U is out
R D Y E S – “RDYES” – not valid
R P _ E S – “R P _ E S” – “R P E E S” – E is already used
R L _ E S – “R L _ E S” – “R L E E S” – invalid
R M _ E S – “R M E E S” – invalid
R C H E S – “RCHES” – invalid
R D E E S – invalid
R P E E S – invalid

Wait, let’s think of actual words:
- R _ _ E S
- R A _ E S – A is out
- R O _ E S – O is out
- R U _ E S – U is out
- R I _ E S – I is out
- R T _ E S – T is out
- R G _ E S – G is out
- R N _ E S – N is out
- R V _ E S – V is out

Valid remaining consonants for positions 2 and 3: C, D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible valid words:
- R C H E S – “RCHES” – invalid
- R C L E S – “RCL ES” – invalid
- R D E E S – invalid
- R P E E S – invalid
- R M E E S – invalid

Wait, let's think systematically. We need a 5-letter word starting with R, ending with ES, with E in position 4, and no A,O,T,I,U,G,N,V.

Possible candidates:
- R E D E S – but E is in 4, so position 2 would be D, position 3 E – but E is already in 4, so duplicate E is allowed? Word “REDES” – valid.
- R E C E S – “RECES” – valid
- R E L E S – “REL ES” – “RELIES” – no, 5 letters
- R E M E S – “REMES” – valid
- R E P E S – “REPE S” – “REPEES” – no
- R E D E S – “REDES” – valid

Between “REDES” and “RECES”, both fit. Let's choose “REDES”.

Check constraints:
- R in 1: ✓
- E in 2: allowed (not yet ruled out)
- D: new letter
- E in 4: ✓
- S in 5: ✓
- No forbidden letters.
