- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- A, R, E, C   (each appeared once with “-” feedback so far)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, T

Positions that have been ruled out for each of those four letters:
A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from REACT)
R: not 2 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from REACT)
E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 2 (from REACT)
C: not 4 (from REACT)

So the unknown pattern looks like:
_ _ _ _ _   with these four letters still to place somewhere, plus one more letter we haven’t tried yet.

We have used the letters A, R, E, C so far.  We still need to test other common consonants or vowels.  Good candidates for the fifth slot are D, I, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses all four known letters (A, R, E, C) plus one new letter
- avoids the ruled-out positions
- is a valid 5-letter word

A quick check of common 5-letter words that contain A, R, E, C gives “CARE” plus one more letter.  “CRANE” is a good candidate:
- C in 1, R in 2, A in 3, N new, E in 5
But R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback), so that fails.

Try “EARLY” – but we haven’t used L yet and positions may work.

Instead, let’s try “CRAVE”:
- C, R, A, V, E
- C in 1 (new position), R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2), so invalid.

Next, “ACCRE” – invalid (duplicate C and not common).

Try “CRANE” again with adjusted positions:
- C in 3, R in 2 (still invalid for R).

Let’s try “REACT” rearranged: “EARLY” uses E, A, R, L, Y – but we need C.

Try “C” in position 5: “EARLY” fails.

Instead, let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 3: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 2, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A _ R E”.

A common word: “C A R E” with a new letter in 3 – “C A R E” is only 4 letters.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 3, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 2: “C _ A R E”.

A common word: “C O A R E” – but O is invalid.

“C L A R E” – but R is in 4, A in 3, E in 5 – “CLARE” is a valid word.

Check positions:
C (1) – new position, allowed
L – new letter
A (3) – allowed (A not ruled out of 3)
R (4) – allowed (R not ruled out of 4)
E (5) – allowed (E not ruled out of 5)

So “CLARE” is a valid guess that uses all four known letters (C, A, R, E) plus a new letter L, and respects all position constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- A, R, E, C   (each appeared once with “-” feedback so far)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, T

Positions that have been ruled out for each of those four letters:
A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from REACT)
R: not 2 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from REACT)
E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 2 (from REACT)
C: not 4 (from REACT)

So the unknown pattern looks like:
_ _ _ _ _   with these four letters still to place somewhere, plus one more letter we haven’t tried yet.

We have used the letters A, R, E, C so far.  We still need to test other common consonants or vowels.  Good candidates for the fifth slot are D, I, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses all four known letters (A, R, E, C) plus one new letter
- avoids the ruled-out positions
- is a valid 5-letter word

A quick check of common 5-letter words that contain A, R, E, C gives “CARE” plus one more letter.  “CRANE” is a good candidate:
- C in 1, R in 2, A in 3, N new, E in 5
But R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback), so that fails.

Try “EARLY” – but we haven’t used L yet and positions may work.

Instead, let’s try “CRAVE”:
- C, R, A, V, E
- C in 1 (new position), R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2), so invalid.

Next, “ACCRE” – invalid (duplicate C and not common).

Try “CRANE” again with adjusted positions:
- C in 3, R in 2 (still invalid for R).

Let’s try “REACT” rearranged: “EARLY” uses E, A, R, L, Y – but we need C.

Try “C” in position 5: “EARLY” fails.

Instead, let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 3: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 1: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 4: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 5: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “A” in position 2: “CRAVE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “E” in position 1: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 5: “CAMEO” has O which is invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 3, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 4, and a new letter in 5.

That gives “C R A E _” – but that’s not a word.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 4, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A R E _” – but that’s “CARE_”.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 2, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A _ R E”.

A common word: “C A R E” with a new letter in 3 – “C A R E” is only 4 letters.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 3, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 2: “C _ A R E”.

A common word: “C O A R E” – but O is invalid.

“C L A R E” – but R is in 4, A in 3, E in 5 – “CLARE” is a valid word.

Check positions:
C (1) – new position, allowed
L – new letter
A (3) – allowed (A not ruled out of 3)
R (4) – allowed (R not ruled out of 4)
E (5) – allowed (E not ruled out of 5)

So “CLARE” is a valid guess that uses all four known letters (C, A, R, E) plus a new letter L, and respects all position constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and E (but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps A, R, E (maybe in new positions).
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses fresh letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is “RAISE”:
- It re-uses A, R, E in new positions (A in 2, R in 1, E in 4).
- Introduces I and S; but S was already ruled out, so that’s bad.

Next candidate: “REACT”:

Let’s pick a word that:

A quick check of common 5-letter words that contain A, R, E, C gives “CARE” plus one more letter.  “CRANE” is a good candidate:
- C in 1, R in 2, A in 3, N new, E in 5
But R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback), so that fails.

Try “EARLY” – but we haven’t used L yet and positions may work.

Instead, let’s try “CRAVE”:
- C, R, A, V, E
- C in 1 (new position), R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2), so invalid.

Next, “ACCRE” – invalid (duplicate C and not common).

Try “CRANE” again with adjusted positions:
- C in 3, R in 2 (still invalid for R).

Let’s try “REACT” rearranged: “EARLY” uses E, A, R, L, Y – but we need C.

Try “C” in position 5: “EARLY” fails.

Instead, let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 3: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 1: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 4: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 5: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “A” in position 2: “CRAVE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “E” in position 1: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 5: “CAMEO” has O which is invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 3, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 4, and a new letter in 5.

That gives “C R A E _” – but that’s not a word.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 4, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A R E _” – but that’s “CARE_”.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 2, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A _ R E”.

A common word: “C A R E” with a new letter in 3 – “C A R E” is only 4 letters.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 3, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 2: “C _ A R E”.

A common word: “C O A R E” – but O is invalid.

“C L A R E” – but R is in 4, A in 3, E in 5 – “CLARE” is a valid word.

Check positions:
C (1) – new position, allowed
L – new letter
A (3) – allowed (A not ruled out of 3)
R (4) – allowed (R not ruled out of 4)
E (5) – allowed (E not ruled out of 5)

  – E was in position 3 in CREAM → E cannot be in 3.
  – A was in position 4 in CREAM → A cannot be in 4.
- Letters definitely absent: O, S, T, L, M.

So the pattern is:
C _ _ _ _ with A, R, E still to place in positions 2-5, and one new letter.

We have used letters: C, A, R, E  
Still untested common letters: D, I, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- starts with C
- uses A, R, E exactly once each
- uses one new letter not in {O, S, T, L, M}
- is a valid 5-letter word

Candidate words:

Wait – let’s list all possible permutations of A, R, E in positions 2-5 that satisfy the positional bans:

Allowed positions:
- R: cannot be 2 → allowed in 3,4,5
- E: cannot be 3 → allowed in 2,4,5
- A: cannot be 4 → allowed in 2,3,5

We need to place A, R, E into positions 2,3,4,5 with one new letter.

Let’s try:
- Position 2: E or A
- Position 3: R or A
- Position 4: R or E
- Position 5: R or E or A

One valid permutation is E in 2, A in 3, R in 5, with a new letter in 4.

That gives: C E A _ R → “CEAR_” – invalid.

Another permutation: A in 2, R in 3, E in 5 → C A R _ E → “CAR_E”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and E (but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

I want a new guess that:
- Keeps A, R, E (maybe in new positions).
- Avoids O and S.
- Uses fresh letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is “RAISE”:
- It re-uses A, R, E in new positions (A in 2, R in 1, E in 4).
- Introduces I and S; but S was already ruled out, so that’s bad.

Next candidate: “REACT”:
- Uses R, E, A in new positions (R1, E2, A3).
- Adds C and T (both untested).
- Avoids O and S.

This seems safe and informative.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but in unknown positions):
- A, R, E, C   (each appeared once with “-” feedback so far)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, T

Positions that have been ruled out for each of those four letters:
A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from REACT)
R: not 2 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from REACT)
E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 2 (from REACT)
C: not 4 (from REACT)

So the unknown pattern looks like:
_ _ _ _ _   with these four letters still to place somewhere, plus one more letter we haven’t tried yet.

We have used the letters A, R, E, C so far.  We still need to test other common consonants or vowels.  Good candidates for the fifth slot are D, I, L, N, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- uses all four known letters (A, R, E, C) plus one new letter
- avoids the ruled-out positions
- is a valid 5-letter word

A quick check of common 5-letter words that contain A, R, E, C gives “CARE” plus one more letter.  “CRANE” is a good candidate:
- C in 1, R in 2, A in 3, N new, E in 5
But R cannot be in 2 (from AROSE feedback), so that fails.

Try “EARLY” – but we haven’t used L yet and positions may work.

Instead, let’s try “CRAVE”:
- C, R, A, V, E
- C in 1 (new position), R in 2 (but R cannot be in 2), so invalid.

Next, “ACCRE” – invalid (duplicate C and not common).

Try “CRANE” again with adjusted positions:
- C in 3, R in 2 (still invalid for R).

Let’s try “REACT” rearranged: “EARLY” uses E, A, R, L, Y – but we need C.

Try “C” in position 5: “EARLY” fails.

Instead, let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 3: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 2: “ACCRE” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 1: “CRANE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “C” in position 4: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “C” in position 5: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “A” in position 2: “CRAVE” fails R in 2.

Let’s try “E” in position 1: “EARCY” invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 3: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “R” in position 5: “CAMEO” has O which is invalid.

Let’s try “R” in position 4: “CARE” plus a letter.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 3, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 4, and a new letter in 5.

That gives “C R A E _” – but that’s not a word.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “R” in position 4, “A” in position 2, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A R E _” – but that’s “CARE_”.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 2, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 3: “C A _ R E”.

A common word: “C A R E” with a new letter in 3 – “C A R E” is only 4 letters.

Let’s try “C” in position 1, “A” in position 3, “R” in position 4, “E” in position 5, and a new letter in 2: “C _ A R E”.

A common word: “C O A R E” – but O is invalid.

“C L A R E” – but R is in 4, A in 3, E in 5 – “CLARE” is a valid word.

Check positions:
C (1) – new position, allowed
L – new letter
A (3) – allowed (A not ruled out of 3)
R (4) – allowed (R not ruled out of 4)
E (5) – allowed (E not ruled out of 5)

So “CLARE” is a valid guess that uses all four known letters (C, A, R, E) plus a new letter L, and respects all position constraints.

Allowed positions:

Another permutation: A in 2, R in 3, E in 5 → C A R _ E → “CAR_E”.

A valid word: “CARES” – but S is invalid.  
“CARED” – D is new, but E is in 5 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
“CARED” fits all constraints.

Let’s check:
C(✓) A(2) R(3) E(5) D(new)  
- A not in 4 (ok)  
- R not in 2 (ok)  
- E not in 3 (ok)  
- D is new and allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is “CARED”.

From the latest feedback (CARED → C✓ A✓ R- E✓ D×) we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - C is in position 1.
   - A is in position 2.
   - E is in position 4.

2. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from CARED feedback: R-).

3. Letters definitely absent: O, S, T, L, M, D.

4. We still need to place R and the fifth letter.

Pattern so far: C A _ E _

R must go in position 5 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3, and 1 is C, 4 is E).

That leaves position 3 to be filled by a new letter (must not be any of O, S, T, L, M, D).

Common unused letters: B, F, G, H, I, N, P, U, Y.

A valid word fitting C A _ E _ with R in 5 is “C A N E R” → CANER.

Check:
- C(✓) A(✓) N E R
- R is in 5 (allowed, since it was only banned from 3)
- N is new and allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is CANER.
