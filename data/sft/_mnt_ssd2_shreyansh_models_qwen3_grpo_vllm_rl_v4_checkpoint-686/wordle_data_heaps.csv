### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - Last S is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (…S).
- It contains A, E, S (but S is only in position 5).
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- E is not in positions 4 or 5.
- R, O, L are not in the word.

Letters left to test: common consonants like T, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing A and E, with A not in positions 1-2 and E not in positions 4-5.

Possible pattern: _ _ _ E S or _ _ A _ S or _ A _ _ S, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 3 and E in position 2, and tests a new consonant in position 1: T.

Candidate: T A E _ S → “TAES_” – but we need a valid word.

Valid word: “TAES_” is not valid, but “TAES” is 4 letters. We need 5.

Alternative: C A T E S – but that has C, A, T, E, S. Let’s check:
- C (new letter)
- A (must be in positions 3,4,5 – here position 2, which is invalid per feedback).
So that’s no good.

Next: C A P E S – but A is in position 2 again, invalid.

Next: M A N E S – A in position 2, invalid.

Next: P A N E S – same issue.

Next: _ _ A _ S – let’s try C H A E S – but E is in position 4, invalid.

Next: _ E A _ S – let’s try N E A R S – but R is excluded.

Next: _ _ E _ S – let’s try T E X E S – but X is uncommon.

Next: _ A E _ S – let’s try C A E S E – but not a valid word.

Next: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in positions 3,4,5 and E must be in positions 1,2,3.

Let’s try: T E A C S – but C is new, E in position 2 (valid), A in position 3 (valid), S in 5 (correct). This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains A and E (✓).
- A not in positions 1-2 (it’s in 3) (✓).
- E not in positions 4-5 (it’s in 2) (✓).
- No R, O, L (✓).

So “TEACS” seems valid. However, “TEACS” is a valid word (short for teachers or a variant spelling).

But let me think of a more common word: “PEASE” – but P, E, A, S, E. E is in position 2 and 5, but 5 is S, so E in 2 (valid). A in 3 (valid). No R, O, L. But P is new.

“PEASE”:
- P (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- S (position 5, correct)
- E (position 4, invalid per feedback – E is not in position 4).

So “PEASE” is invalid because E is in position 4.

Next: “HEATS” – H, E, A, T, S.
- H (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- T (new)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. SALES → S(-) A(-) L(x) E(-) S(✓)
   - First S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - L is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - Last S is in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (…S).
- It contains A, E, S (but S is only in position 5).
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- E is not in positions 4 or 5.
- R, O, L are not in the word.

Letters left to test: common consonants like T, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing A and E, with A not in positions 1-2 and E not in positions 4-5.

Possible pattern: _ _ _ E S or _ _ A _ S or _ A _ _ S, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 3 and E in position 2, and tests a new consonant in position 1: T.

Candidate: T A E _ S → “TAES_” – but we need a valid word.

Valid word: “TAES_” is not valid, but “TAES” is 4 letters. We need 5.

Alternative: C A T E S – but that has C, A, T, E, S. Let’s check:
- C (new letter)
- A (must be in positions 3,4,5 – here position 2, which is invalid per feedback).
So that’s no good.

Next: C A P E S – but A is in position 2 again, invalid.

Next: M A N E S – A in position 2, invalid.

Next: P A N E S – same issue.

Next: _ _ A _ S – let’s try C H A E S – but E is in position 4, invalid.

Next: _ E A _ S – let’s try N E A R S – but R is excluded.

Next: _ _ E _ S – let’s try T E X E S – but X is uncommon.

Next: _ A E _ S – let’s try C A E S E – but not a valid word.

Next: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in positions 3,4,5 and E must be in positions 1,2,3.

Let’s try: T E A C S – but C is new, E in position 2 (valid), A in position 3 (valid), S in 5 (correct). This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Ends with S (✓).
- Contains A and E (✓).
- A not in positions 1-2 (it’s in 3) (✓).
- E not in positions 4-5 (it’s in 2) (✓).
- No R, O, L (✓).

So “TEACS” seems valid. However, “TEACS” is a valid word (short for teachers or a variant spelling).

But let me think of a more common word: “PEASE” – but P, E, A, S, E. E is in position 2 and 5, but 5 is S, so E in 2 (valid). A in 3 (valid). No R, O, L. But P is new.

“PEASE”:
- P (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- S (position 5, correct)
- E (position 4, invalid per feedback – E is not in position 4).

So “PEASE” is invalid because E is in position 4.

Next: “HEATS” – H, E, A, T, S.
- H (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- T (new)
- S (position 5, correct)
No R, O, L.
This seems valid.

“HEATS” is a common word.

Let’s go with “HEATS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the information we'll get from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, E (but none of R or O).
- A is not in slot 1, S is not in slot 4, E is not in slot 5.

I want a new word that:
1. Uses A, S, E in different positions.
2. Avoids R and O.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

A good candidate is ""SALES"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1).
- L is a new consonant to test.
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only excluded from position 5).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S was only excluded from position 4).

This tests the placement of A, S, E and introduces L.

Next: _ A E _ S – let’s try C A E S E – but not a valid word.

Next: _ _ _ A S – but A must be in positions 3,4,5 and E must be in positions 1,2,3.

Let’s try: T E A C S – but C is new, E in position 2 (valid), A in position 3 (valid), S in 5 (correct). This is a valid word.

Check constraints:

- A not in positions 1-2 (it’s in 3) (✓).
- E not in positions 4-5 (it’s in 2) (✓).

So “TEACS” seems valid. However, “TEACS” is a valid word (short for teachers or a variant spelling).

But let me think of a more common word: “PEASE” – but P, E, A, S, E. E is in position 2 and 5, but 5 is S, so E in 2 (valid). A in 3 (valid). No R, O, L. But P is new.

“PEASE”:
- P (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- S (position 5, correct)
- E (position 4, invalid per feedback – E is not in position 4).

So “PEASE” is invalid because E is in position 4.

Next: “HEATS” – H, E, A, T, S.
- H (new)
- E (position 2, valid)
- A (position 3, valid)
- T (new)

From the feedback so far:

- The word is H E A _ S (positions 1-5).
- We have tried D in position 4 and it was rejected (D x).
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, L, T, D.
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, C, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common English 5-letter words matching H E A _ S:
- HEAKS – but “heaks” is uncommon (a dialectal term).
- HEAMS – “heams” is archaic for “heaps”.
- HEAPS – common word, P is still allowed.
- HEAYS – not a standard word.
- HEABS – not a word.

Thus the only common, valid candidate left is HEAPS.
