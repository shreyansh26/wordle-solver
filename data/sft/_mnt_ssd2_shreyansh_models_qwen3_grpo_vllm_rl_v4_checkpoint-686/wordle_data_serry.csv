### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters from this set to test as many positions as possible. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. It contains E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 3 (from SHEND).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N, D.
4. We still need to test positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and we want to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
   Remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: R, O, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Start with S.
- Place E in position 2 or 4 (to test which is correct).
- Introduce several new, high-frequency letters that haven’t appeared yet.

Option 1: Place E in position 2 → S E _ _ _
   Try “SEWER” – but W and R are fine, yet we already know E can’t be in position 3 (but that’s okay here).  
   However “SEWER” uses W and R, both still possible.

Option 2: Place E in position 4 → S _ _ E _
   Try “SMILE” – but L is already ruled out.  
   Try “SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, but H is already ruled out (so P, O, K are okay).  
   But we already ruled out O? No, O hasn’t been tested yet.

Actually let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 and introduces several new letters.  
“SEWER” is good: S ✓, E in position 2, W, E, R.  
But we already have E in position 4, so we’d have double E – not ideal.

Better: “SERFS” – but F and S are okay, but S is already in position 1.  
Actually “SERFS” has S twice – not ideal either.

Another option: “SEIZE” – but Z is less common and we already have E in position 2 and 4.

Let’s go with “SEWER” as it introduces W and R, both still possible.

But wait – we want to avoid repeating letters unnecessarily. Let’s try a word with E in position 4 instead to test that placement.

“SMILE” – L ruled out.  
“SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, E in position 4.  
“SPOKE” seems good.

But let’s check: S ✓, P, O, K, E.  
Letters used: S, P, O, K, E – none of L, A, T, H, N, D appear.

“SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, E in position 4.  
“SPOKE” seems good.

But let’s check: S ✓, P, O, K, E.  
Letters used: S, P, O, K, E – none of L, A, T, H, N, D appear.  
This tests P, O, K and places E in position 4.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. It contains the letter E, but E is **not** in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore E must be in position 2.
3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   L, A, T, H, N, D, P, O, K.
4. Remaining unused common letters: R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, etc.

So the word looks like:  
S E _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with letters that have **not** been ruled out.  
Good candidates are R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W.

A strong next guess is “SEWER” because:
- It keeps E in position 2 and S in position 1.
- It introduces W (new) and R (new) in positions 3 and 5.
- It repeats E in position 4, but we already know E must be in position 2, so this is acceptable to test W and R.

Another candidate is “SEICY” (using I, C, Y), but “SEWER” is more common and tests useful letters.

Therefore, choose “SEWER”.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters from this set to test as many positions as possible. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains E, but not in position 5.
3. It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Possible next guesses:
- SHINE: S ✓, H, I, N, E (E in position 5 is invalid, but this has E in 5)
- SHOCK: S ✓, H, O, C, K (but no E)
- SNIDE: S ✓, N, I, D, E (E in position 5 invalid)
- SHEND: S ✓, H, E, N, D (E in position 3 is valid)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. It contains E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 3 (from SHEND).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N, D.
4. We still need to test positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and we want to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
   Remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: R, O, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Start with S.
- Place E in position 2 or 4 (to test which is correct).
- Introduce several new, high-frequency letters that haven’t appeared yet.

Option 1: Place E in position 2 → S E _ _ _
   Try “SEWER” – but W and R are fine, yet we already know E can’t be in position 3 (but that’s okay here).  
   However “SEWER” uses W and R, both still possible.

Option 2: Place E in position 4 → S _ _ E _
   Try “SMILE” – but L is already ruled out.  
   Try “SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, but H is already ruled out (so P, O, K are okay).  
   But we already ruled out O? No, O hasn’t been tested yet.

Actually let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 and introduces several new letters.  
“SEWER” is good: S ✓, E in position 2, W, E, R.  
But we already have E in position 4, so we’d have double E – not ideal.

Better: “SERFS” – but F and S are okay, but S is already in position 1.  
Actually “SERFS” has S twice – not ideal either.

Another option: “SEIZE” – but Z is less common and we already have E in position 2 and 4.

Let’s go with “SEWER” as it introduces W and R, both still possible.

But wait – we want to avoid repeating letters unnecessarily. Let’s try a word with E in position 4 instead to test that placement.

“SMILE” – L ruled out.  
“SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, E in position 4.  
“SPOKE” seems good.

But let’s check: S ✓, P, O, K, E.  
Letters used: S, P, O, K, E – none of L, A, T, H, N, D appear.  
This tests P, O, K and places E in position 4.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. E is in the word and must be in position 2 (because in positions 3,4,5 it has been marked “-” or “x”).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N, D, P, O, K, W.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R (from SEWER feedback: R “-”).

So the word structure is: S E _ _ _
and it must contain R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining unused common letters that have not been ruled out:  
B, C, F, G, I, M, U, Y, plus R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S E
- Contains R (not yet placed)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- S E R _ _  → “SERFS” (F is okay, but F is repeated)  
- S E _ R _  → “SEIR_” but “SEIR_” is not a common start.  
- S E _ _ R  → “SECUR” is not a word; “SEBIR” is not a word.

Looking at real words:
- “SEBUM” – uses B, U, M (all still possible) and places R in position 4.  
- “SEIR_” – nothing common.  
- “SECR_” – nothing common.

“SEBUM” fits: S E B U M and contains R in position 4 (but wait, “SEBUM” is S E B U M – no R).  
Oops, no R. Need to include R.

Real word with S E _ _ R:  
“SEIR_” – nothing.  
“SECR_” – nothing.  
“SEBIR” – not a word.

Wait, “SEIR” is not a word, but “SEBUM” is.  
Real word with R: “SEIR” is not valid, but “SEBUM” is.  
Let me re-examine.

Actually, a valid word: “SEIR” is not a word, but “SEBUM” is.  
Another candidate: “SEIR” is not valid.  
“SECR” is not valid.

Valid word: “SEBUM” – no R.  
Valid word: “SEIR” – not valid.  
Valid word: “SECR” – not valid.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words starting with SE and containing R:  
“SERFS” – but F is okay, and R is in position 3.  
“SERFS” is valid: S E R F S.  
Letters: S, E, R, F, S.  
R is in position 3, F is new, S is already confirmed.

But we already have S in position 1, so position 5 can be S again?  
The word can have repeated letters, but we want to test new letters.

Another candidate: “SEIR” is not a word.  
“SECR” is not a word.

Another approach: “SEBUM” is valid, but no R.  
“SEBUM” is S E B U M.

We must include R.  
Valid word: “SEIR” is not valid.  
Valid word: “SECR” is not valid.

Wait, let me think differently.  
From SEWER feedback: R is in the word but not in position 5 (because it was marked “-”).  
So R must be in position 3 or 4.

We need a word: S E _ _ _ with R in position 3 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Valid words:
- S E R _ _  → “SERFS” (F is okay, S is okay, but S already in 1)  
- S E _ R _  → “SEIR_” – nothing.  
- S E _ _ R  → “SEBUM” – no, no R.

Actually, “SEBUM” is S E B U M – no R.

Another valid word: “SEIR” is not valid.  
“SECR” is not valid.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with SE and containing R:  
- SERFS  
- SERGE (but G is okay)  
- SERED (but D is ruled out)  
- SERIN (but I, N – N is ruled out)  
- SEROW (but O is ruled out)  
- SERUM (U is okay, M is okay) – but U is okay, M is okay, R is in position 3.

“SERUM” is valid: S E R U M.  
Letters: S, E, R, U, M.  
All letters not ruled out.  
R is in position 3 (new test), U and M are new.

This seems best.

Therefore, next guess: “SERUM”.

<guess>SERUM</guess>",SERUM,"From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. E is in the word and must be in position 2 (because in positions 3,4,5 it has been marked “-” or “x”).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N, D, P, O, K, W.
4. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R (from SEWER feedback: R “-”).

So the word structure is: S E _ _ _
and it must contain R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining unused common letters that have not been ruled out:  
B, C, F, G, I, M, U, Y, plus R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S E
- Contains R (not yet placed)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:

- S E _ R _  → “SEIR_” but “SEIR_” is not a common start.

Looking at real words:
- “SEBUM” – uses B, U, M (all still possible) and places R in position 4.  
- “SEIR_” – nothing common.  
- “SECR_” – nothing common.

“SEBUM” fits: S E B U M and contains R in position 4 (but wait, “SEBUM” is S E B U M – no R).

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters from this set to test as many positions as possible. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains E, but not in position 5.
3. It does NOT contain L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E somewhere in positions 2-4, and avoiding L, A, T.

Possible next guesses:
- SHINE: S ✓, H, I, N, E (E in position 5 is invalid, but this has E in 5)
- SHOCK: S ✓, H, O, C, K (but no E)
- SNIDE: S ✓, N, I, D, E (E in position 5 invalid)
- SHEND: S ✓, H, E, N, D (E in position 3 is valid)

""SHEND"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Contains E in position 3
- No L, A, T
- All letters are unique

Guess 2: SHEND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. It contains E, but E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) and cannot be in position 3 (from SHEND).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, H, N, D.
4. We still need to test positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and we want to introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet.  
   Remaining common letters not yet ruled out include: R, O, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Start with S.
- Place E in position 2 or 4 (to test which is correct).
- Introduce several new, high-frequency letters that haven’t appeared yet.

Option 1: Place E in position 2 → S E _ _ _
   Try “SEWER” – but W and R are fine, yet we already know E can’t be in position 3 (but that’s okay here).  
   However “SEWER” uses W and R, both still possible.

Option 2: Place E in position 4 → S _ _ E _
   Try “SMILE” – but L is already ruled out.  
   Try “SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, but H is already ruled out (so P, O, K are okay).  
   But we already ruled out O? No, O hasn’t been tested yet.

Actually let’s pick a word that places E in position 2 and introduces several new letters.  
“SEWER” is good: S ✓, E in position 2, W, E, R.  
But we already have E in position 4, so we’d have double E – not ideal.

Better: “SERFS” – but F and S are okay, but S is already in position 1.  
Actually “SERFS” has S twice – not ideal either.

Another option: “SEIZE” – but Z is less common and we already have E in position 2 and 4.

Let’s go with “SEWER” as it introduces W and R, both still possible.

But wait – we want to avoid repeating letters unnecessarily. Let’s try a word with E in position 4 instead to test that placement.

“SMILE” – L ruled out.  
“SPOKE” – P, O, K are new, E in position 4.  
“SPOKE” seems good.

But let’s check: S ✓, P, O, K, E.  
Letters used: S, P, O, K, E – none of L, A, T, H, N, D appear.  
This tests P, O, K and places E in position 4.

Therefore:

<guess>SPOKE</guess>

Guess 3: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) K(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far we know:

1. The word starts with S (position 1 confirmed).
2. It contains the letter E, but E is **not** in positions 3, 4, or 5.  
   Therefore E must be in position 2.
3. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
   L, A, T, H, N, D, P, O, K.
4. Remaining unused common letters: R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, etc.

So the word looks like:  
S E _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with letters that have **not** been ruled out.  
Good candidates are R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W.

A strong next guess is “SEWER” because:
- It keeps E in position 2 and S in position 1.
- It introduces W (new) and R (new) in positions 3 and 5.
- It repeats E in position 4, but we already know E must be in position 2, so this is acceptable to test W and R.

Another candidate is “SEICY” (using I, C, Y), but “SEWER” is more common and tests useful letters.

Therefore, choose “SEWER”.

- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- S E R _ _  → “SERFS” (F is okay, but F is repeated)  
- S E _ R _  → “SEIR_” but “SEIR_” is not a common start.  
- S E _ _ R  → “SECUR” is not a word; “SEBIR” is not a word.

Looking at real words:
- “SEBUM” – uses B, U, M (all still possible) and places R in position 4.  
- “SEIR_” – nothing common.  
- “SECR_” – nothing common.

“SEBUM” fits: S E B U M and contains R in position 4 (but wait, “SEBUM” is S E B U M – no R).

“SECR” is not a word.

“SEBUM” is S E B U M.

We must include R.

Remaining unused common letters: R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W, etc.\n\nSo the word looks like:  \nS E _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with letters that have **not** been ruled out.  \nGood candidates are R, I, C, U, M, G, B, F, Y, W.\n\nA strong next guess is “SEWER” because:\n- It keeps E in position 2 and S in position 1.\n- It introduces W (new) and R (new) in positions 3 and 5.\n- It repeats E in position 4, but we already know E must be in position 2, so this is acceptable to test W and R.\n\nAnother candidate is “SEICY” (using I, C, Y), but “SEWER” is more common and tests useful letters.\n\nTherefore, choose “SEWER”.\n\n<guess>SEWER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: SHEND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: SPOKE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) K(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: SEWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) W(x) E(-) R(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the four rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.

We now know:

- Pattern: S E R _ _
- Letters confirmed: S, E, R in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Letters ruled out: L, A, T, H, N, D, P, O, K, W, U, M.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, I, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “SER” and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Valid candidates:
- “SERFS” – F is allowed, S is allowed (repetition okay).
- “SERGE” – G, E; E is already in place, G is allowed.
- “SERIR” – not a valid word.
- “SERPY” – not a word.

The most common valid word is “SERFS”.

Check letters: S, E, R, F, S – all allowed.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “SERFS”.
