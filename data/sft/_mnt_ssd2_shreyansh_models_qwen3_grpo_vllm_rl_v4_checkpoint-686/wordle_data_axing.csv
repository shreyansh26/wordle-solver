### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and even if none are correct, it eliminates many common letters from consideration.

From the new feedback on ADMIT:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- I(-) – the letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D, M, T are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.

Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, B, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (and A already fixed in position 1).

We need three more letters to fill positions 2, 3, 5, with I appearing in one of them.

A good next test word should:
1. Keep A in position 1.
2. Place I in a new position (2 or 3 or 5).
3. Use new consonants not yet tried.

Let’s try “A” + “I” + “N” + “C” + “K” → “A I N C K” → “AINCK” (but that’s not a valid word).  
A valid word with A _ I _ _ is “A” + “C” + “I” + “N” + “G” → “ACING”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:

From the new feedback on AGING:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – still correct in position 3.
- N(✓) – still correct in position 4.
- G(✓) – the first G is in the correct position (position 5).
- G(-) – the second G is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is:
A _ I N G
and G must appear somewhere else (but position 5 is already taken by G, so this implies there is another G in the word, which would have to be in position 2, but feedback says it's not there. This seems like a contradiction unless the word has two Gs.)

However, in standard English 5-letter words, having two Gs is possible (e.g., ""AGING"" itself). But since we've already placed G in position 5, and the feedback for position 2 says G is in the word but wrong position, this implies the word must have two Gs: one in position 5 and another G in position 2 (but feedback says it's not in position 2). This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"" which has two Gs. But we already guessed ""AGING"" and got feedback that G is in position 5 correctly and that the second G is in the word but wrong position, which is a bit ambiguous.

But looking back at the feedback format: the second G in ""AGING"" received G(-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. Since position 2 is where this second G is, this implies there must be another G in the word not in position 2. But our pattern is A _ I N G, and position 5 is already G. This would require the word to have two Gs, one in position 5 and another in position 2, but feedback says the one in position 2 is wrong. This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"".

But we already guessed ""AGING"" and the feedback was:
A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)

This suggests that the word is ""AGING"" because:
- A is correct in position 1
- I is correct in position 3
- N is correct in position 4
- G is correct in position 5
- The G in position 2 is in the word but wrong position (which would be position 2 itself, implying it's not there, but since position 5 is G, this would require another G in the word, which is only possible if the word is ""AGING"")

This seems like the feedback is indicating the word is ""AGING"" because all other positions except 2 match, and the G in position 2 is marked as being in the word but wrong position, which is contradictory unless it's a special case.

But more likely, the feedback is indicating that the word has G in position 5 and another G in position 2 is not correct, implying the word is not ""AGING"". This seems like we're stuck.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
- A(✓) position 1
- G(-) position 2: G is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) position 3
- N(✓) position 4
- G(✓) position 5

This implies the word has G in position 5 and another G somewhere else (not position 2). The only remaining position for the other G is position 2, but feedback says it's not there. This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"", but that would have G in position 2 which feedback says is wrong.

This suggests there might be an inconsistency in the feedback, but more likely I'm misinterpreting. Let me think differently: maybe the word has G in position 5 and another G in position 1, but position 1 is A. So this is impossible.

This indicates that the word must be ""AGING"" despite the feedback seeming contradictory. The feedback for position 2's G being ""-"" (in word but wrong position) is actually confirming that the word is ""AGING"" because the only other position G can be is position 5, which is already correct. The feedback for position 2's G is essentially saying ""not position 2"", which is consistent with the word being ""AGING"".

Therefore, the only possible word left is ""AGING"".

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, C.

Remaining possible consonants for position 2: B, F, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A valid 5-letter word matching A _ I N G is “ABING” (but “ABING” isn’t a recognized English word).  
The actual recognized word is “A” + “F” + “I” + “N” + “G” → “AFING” (still not valid).  
Wait—let me list real words: the only common English word that fits A _ I N G is “AGING”.

Check letters:
- A(✓) position 1
- G in position 2 – hasn’t been tested yet
- I(✓) position 3
- N(✓) position 4
- G(✓) position 5

All constraints satisfied.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)
Guess 3: ACING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
Guess 4: AGING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on AGING:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – still correct in position 3.
- N(✓) – still correct in position 4.
- G(✓) – the first G is in the correct position (position 5).
- G(-) – the second G is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So the pattern is:
A _ I N G
and G must appear somewhere else (but position 5 is already taken by G, so this implies there is another G in the word, which would have to be in position 2, but feedback says it's not there. This seems like a contradiction unless the word has two Gs.)

However, in standard English 5-letter words, having two Gs is possible (e.g., ""AGING"" itself). But since we've already placed G in position 5, and the feedback for position 2 says G is in the word but wrong position, this implies the word must have two Gs: one in position 5 and another G in position 2 (but feedback says it's not in position 2). This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"" which has two Gs. But we already guessed ""AGING"" and got feedback that G is in position 5 correctly and that the second G is in the word but wrong position, which is a bit ambiguous.

But looking back at the feedback format: the second G in ""AGING"" received G(-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. Since position 2 is where this second G is, this implies there must be another G in the word not in position 2. But our pattern is A _ I N G, and position 5 is already G. This would require the word to have two Gs, one in position 5 and another in position 2, but feedback says the one in position 2 is wrong. This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"".

But we already guessed ""AGING"" and the feedback was:
A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)

This suggests that the word is ""AGING"" because:
- A is correct in position 1
- I is correct in position 3
- N is correct in position 4
- G is correct in position 5
- The G in position 2 is in the word but wrong position (which would be position 2 itself, implying it's not there, but since position 5 is G, this would require another G in the word, which is only possible if the word is ""AGING"")

This seems like the feedback is indicating the word is ""AGING"" because all other positions except 2 match, and the G in position 2 is marked as being in the word but wrong position, which is contradictory unless it's a special case.

But more likely, the feedback is indicating that the word has G in position 5 and another G in position 2 is not correct, implying the word is not ""AGING"". This seems like we're stuck.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
- A(✓) position 1
- G(-) position 2: G is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) position 3
- N(✓) position 4
- G(✓) position 5

This implies the word has G in position 5 and another G somewhere else (not position 2). The only remaining position for the other G is position 2, but feedback says it's not there. This seems impossible unless the word is ""AGING"", but that would have G in position 2 which feedback says is wrong.

This suggests there might be an inconsistency in the feedback, but more likely I'm misinterpreting. Let me think differently: maybe the word has G in position 5 and another G in position 1, but position 1 is A. So this is impossible.

This indicates that the word must be ""AGING"" despite the feedback seeming contradictory. The feedback for position 2's G being ""-"" (in word but wrong position) is actually confirming that the word is ""AGING"" because the only other position G can be is position 5, which is already correct. The feedback for position 2's G is essentially saying ""not position 2"", which is consistent with the word being ""AGING"".

Therefore, the only possible word left is ""AGING"".Based on the feedback, the word must be ""AGING"" because:
- A is correct in position 1
- I is correct in position 3
- N is correct in position 4
- G is correct in position 5
- The G in position 2 is marked as ""in word but wrong position"", which is consistent with the word being ""AGING"" (the only other G is in position 5)
