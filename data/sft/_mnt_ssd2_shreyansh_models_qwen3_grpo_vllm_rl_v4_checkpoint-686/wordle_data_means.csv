1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This gives us the best chance to eliminate or confirm many letters in the secret word.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions):
   - A (from AROSE and STEAK: wrong in positions 1 and 3)
   - S (from AROSE and STEAK: wrong in positions 4 and 1)
   - E (from AROSE and STEAK: wrong in positions 5 and 2)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - R, O, T, K

3. Therefore the word contains A, S, E and two other letters (unknown, not R,O,T,K).

We need to place A, S, E in new positions and introduce two new consonants.  
Good remaining consonants: L, N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E are already known, and O is out).

Let’s try a word that:
- puts A in position 2 or 4 (positions 1,3,5 ruled out)
- puts S in position 2,3,5 (positions 1,4 ruled out)
- puts E in position 1,3,4 (positions 2,5 ruled out)
- adds two new consonants.

A promising candidate is “LEASE”:
- L (new)
- E (in position 2 – allowed, since E was only wrong in 5 and 2 in previous guesses; position 2 is still possible if we consider the feedback more carefully)
- A (position 3 – allowed)
- S (position 4 – allowed, since S was only wrong in 4 in AROSE, but that was a “-” meaning wrong position, so 4 is actually ruled out for S)
Oops, S cannot be in 4 again.

Let’s pick “PEALS”:
- P (new)
- E (position 2 – allowed if we treat the feedback as “not in that exact spot”, but E was wrong in position 2 in STEAK, so position 2 is now ruled out for E)
This is getting complicated.

Let’s instead use “PELAS” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Valid word: “PEALS” is valid (a unit of weight).

But let’s double-check positions:

For E: in AROSE it was wrong in position 5, in STEAK it was wrong in position 2 → E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5. So E can be in 1,3,4.

For A: wrong in positions 1 and 3 → A can be in 2,4,5.

For S: wrong in positions 1 and 4 → S can be in 2,3,5.

Let’s try “PEALS”:
- P (new)
- E (position 1 – allowed)

- E (position 2 – allowed if we treat the feedback as “not in that exact spot”, but E was wrong in position 2 in STEAK, so position 2 is now ruled out for E)
This is getting complicated.

Let’s instead use “PELAS” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Valid word: “PEALS” is valid (a unit of weight).

But let’s double-check positions:

For E: in AROSE it was wrong in position 5, in STEAK it was wrong in position 2 → E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5. So E can be in 1,3,4.

For A: wrong in positions 1 and 3 → A can be in 2,4,5.

For S: wrong in positions 1 and 4 → S can be in 2,3,5.

Let’s try “PEALS”:
- P (new)
- E (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- L (new)
- S (position 5 – allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

From the new feedback on PEALS:

- P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 3.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in position 5.

So far we know the secret word looks like: _ E A _ S  
and it must contain no R, O, T, K, P, L.

We still need two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters (avoiding R, O, T, K, P, L).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already placed, and O is out).

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ E A _ S and uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- BEADS – but D is allowed, and B is allowed → B E A D S → but D is in position 4, B in 1.
- CEANS – not a valid word.
- FEARS – F, E, A, R, S – but R is out.
- HEATS – T is out.
- MEANS – M, E, A, N, S – all letters allowed (M, N not yet ruled out).
- NEARS – R is out.
- WEASE – not a common word.
- YEAST – T is out.

The most promising valid word is MEANS:
- M (new, allowed)
- E (position 2 – confirmed ✓)
- A (position 3 – confirmed ✓)
- N (new, allowed)
- S (position 5 – confirmed ✓)

Let’s check MEANS against all constraints:
- Contains A, E, S in correct positions.
- Does not contain R, O, T, K, P, L.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information.

Therefore, MEANS is the best next guess.
