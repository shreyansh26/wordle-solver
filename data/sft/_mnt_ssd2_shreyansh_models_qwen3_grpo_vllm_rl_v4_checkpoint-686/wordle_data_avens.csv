For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback:
- C and R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the correct position (✓) at the 4th slot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _
Known letters: A, E, N
Forbidden letters: C, R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Contains both A and E somewhere else (not in their original positions: A not 3rd, E not 5th).
3. Does not contain C or R.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 3.

Let me brainstorm:
- If A is 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E could be 2nd or 3rd.
  - Example: A E _ N _ → AE?N? (but AE is not common start)
  - Example: A _ E N _ → A E N _? Not sure.
- If A is 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E could be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd.
  - Example: E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word)
- If A is 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - Example: E _ _ N A → E ? ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ E _ N A → ? E ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is already in word)

Wait, maybe I should look for words with N in 4th position, containing A and E, avoiding C and R.

Possible candidates:
- LANCE (but has C, forbidden)
- MANGE (has R? No, MANGE is M-A-N-G-E, but has G)
- PIANO (but has O, and N is 4th)
- STANE (has R? No, STANE is S-T-A-N-E, but E is last which was forbidden)
- TASTE (has R? No, T-A-S-T-E, but N is 4th here, not present)
- VENUE (has R? No, V-E-N-U-E, but N is 3rd, not 4th)
- WAGON (has R? No, W-A-G-O-N, N is 5th)
- MANTE (not a valid word)
- PIANO (already considered)
- STANE (S-T-A-N-E, N is 4th, A is 3rd which was wrong, E is 5th which was wrong - but this is same as CRANE feedback)
- TALON (has R? No, T-A-L-O-N, N is 5th)
- PANED (P-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- LANED (L-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- MANED (M-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)

Hmm, most common words with N in 4th seem to be like:
- STANE (but A is 3rd, E is 5th - both wrong positions)
- TALON (N is 5th)
- VENUE (N is 3rd)
- WAGON (N is 5th)

Wait, maybe I should try:
- SLATE (but has R? No, S-L-A-T-E, N is not here)
- CRANE (already used)
- BRANE (B-R-A-N-E, has R which is forbidden)
- GRANE (G-R-A-N-E, has R)
- FRANC (has R and C)
- PANIC (has R and C)
- MANIC (has R and C)

This is tricky. Maybe ""SLATE"" is similar but lacks N. Let me think differently - the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere.

Possible structure: _ _ _ N _ with A and E in 1,2,3,5 positions (but not original positions).

Let me try:
- E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- _ E A N _ → ? E A N ? (but E is already in word, A is 3rd)
- _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- A _ E N _ → A ? E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 1st)
- _ _ A N E → ? ? A N E (but E is 5th which was wrong)
- _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is 3rd, A is 5th - both could be correct)

The last option seems possible: _ _ E N A
Letters: E, N, A (all required), no C or R.
Possible words:
- B E E N A (not valid)
- D E E N A (not valid)
- F E E N A (not valid)
- G E E N A (not valid)
- H E E N A (not valid)
- L E E N A (not valid)
- M E E N A (not valid)
- P E E N A (not valid)
- S E E N A (not valid)
- T E E N A (not valid)
- V E E N A (not valid)
- W E E N A (not valid)
- Y E E N A (not valid)

None of these are valid. Maybe _ A E N _:
- B A E N ? (not valid)
- D A E N ? (not valid)
- F A E N ? (not valid)
- G A E N ? (not valid)
- H A E N ? (not valid)
- L A E N ? (not valid)

- S A E N ? (not valid)
- T A E N ? (not valid)
- V A E N ? (not valid)
- W A E N ? (not valid)
- Y A E N ? (not valid)

Also not valid. Maybe _ E _ N A:
- B E ? N A (but ? must be A or E, but A is already in word)
- D E ? N A (same)
- F E ? N A (same)
- G E ? N A (same)
- H E ? N A (same)
- L E ? N A (same)
- M E ? N A (same)
- P E ? N A (same)
- S E ? N A (same)
- T E ? N A (same)
- V E ? N A (same)
- W E ? N A (same)
- Y E ? N A (same)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try ""STANE"" again - even though A was 3rd and E was 5th, but this is the only common word with N in 4th containing A and E.

But ""STANE"" is S-T-A-N-E:
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but wrong position (was 3rd, now 3rd again - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but wrong position (was 5th, now 5th - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)

This suggests that in the secret word:
- N is 4th
- A is NOT 3rd
- E is NOT 5th

So possible positions:
- A could be 1, 2, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, or 3
- N is 4

Let me try to construct:
- A in 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E must be 2nd or 3rd
  - Example: A E _ N _ → A E ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
  - Possible: A E D N T (but not a word)
  - Possible: A E G N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E M N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E S N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E L N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E P N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E V N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E W N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E Y N T (not a word)
  - None seem valid.

- A in 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E must be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd
  - E 1st: E A _ N _
    - Example: E A ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E A S N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A M N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A P N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A V N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A W N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A Y N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 3rd: _ A E N _
    - Example: ? A E N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: M A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: P A E N T (not a word)

    - Possible: V A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: W A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: Y A E N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

- A in 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
  - E 1st: E _ _ N A
    - Example: E ? ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E S T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 2nd: _ E _ N A
    - Example: ? E ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S E T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 3rd: _ _ E N A
    - Example: ? ? E N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S T E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S P E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S V E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S W E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S Y E N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

This is proving difficult. Maybe ""STANE"" is the closest, but it reuses the same positions for A and E which would contradict the feedback. Let me try ""SLATE"" - but it lacks N in 4th.

Wait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it's obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.

Actually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that's not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it's a valid word (variant of stone).

Given the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let's try it:

STANE: S-T-A-N-E
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but not 5th (was -)

This would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they're same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.

I think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":
- L: ?
- E: ?
- A: ?
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- T: ?

But LEANT is L-E-A-N-T:
- A is 3rd (was - in CRANE)
- E is 2nd (was - in CRANE)
- N is 4th ✓
- No C or R

This seems valid - LEANT has:
- N in 4th ✓
- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)
- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)

But is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it's past tense of lean.

- N is 4th
- A is NOT 3rd
- E is NOT 5th

So possible positions:
- A could be 1, 2, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, or 3
- N is 4

Let me try to construct:
- A in 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E must be 2nd or 3rd
  - Example: A E _ N _ → A E ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
  - Possible: A E D N T (but not a word)

  - Possible: A E L N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E P N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E V N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E W N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E Y N T (not a word)
  - None seem valid.

- A in 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E must be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd
  - E 1st: E A _ N _
    - Example: E A ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E A S N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A M N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A P N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A V N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A W N T (not a word)

    - None seem valid.

    - Possible: Y A E N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

- A in 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
  - E 1st: E _ _ N A

    - Possible: S V E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S W E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S Y E N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

This is proving difficult. Maybe ""STANE"" is the closest, but it reuses the same positions for A and E which would contradict the feedback. Let me try ""SLATE"" - but it lacks N in 4th.

Wait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it's obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.

Actually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that's not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it's a valid word (variant of stone).

Given the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let's try it:

STANE: S-T-A-N-E
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but not 5th (was -)

This would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they're same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.

I think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":
- L: ?
- E: ?
- A: ?
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- T: ?

But LEANT is L-E-A-N-T:
- A is 3rd (was - in CRANE)
- E is 2nd (was - in CRANE)
- N is 4th ✓
- No C or R

This seems valid - LEANT has:
- N in 4th ✓
- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)
- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)

But is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it's past tense of lean.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C and R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the correct position (✓) at the 4th slot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _
Known letters: A, E, N
Forbidden letters: C, R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Contains both A and E somewhere else (not in their original positions: A not 3rd, E not 5th).
3. Does not contain C or R.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 3.

Let me brainstorm:
- If A is 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E could be 2nd or 3rd.
  - Example: A E _ N _ → AE?N? (but AE is not common start)
  - Example: A _ E N _ → A E N _? Not sure.
- If A is 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E could be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd.
  - Example: E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word)
- If A is 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - Example: E _ _ N A → E ? ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ E _ N A → ? E ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is already in word)

Wait, maybe I should look for words with N in 4th position, containing A and E, avoiding C and R.

Possible candidates:
- LANCE (but has C, forbidden)
- MANGE (has R? No, MANGE is M-A-N-G-E, but has G)
- PIANO (but has O, and N is 4th)
- STANE (has R? No, STANE is S-T-A-N-E, but E is last which was forbidden)
- TASTE (has R? No, T-A-S-T-E, but N is 4th here, not present)
- VENUE (has R? No, V-E-N-U-E, but N is 3rd, not 4th)
- WAGON (has R? No, W-A-G-O-N, N is 5th)
- MANTE (not a valid word)
- PIANO (already considered)
- STANE (S-T-A-N-E, N is 4th, A is 3rd which was wrong, E is 5th which was wrong - but this is same as CRANE feedback)
- TALON (has R? No, T-A-L-O-N, N is 5th)
- PANED (P-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- LANED (L-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- MANED (M-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)

Hmm, most common words with N in 4th seem to be like:
- STANE (but A is 3rd, E is 5th - both wrong positions)
- TALON (N is 5th)
- VENUE (N is 3rd)
- WAGON (N is 5th)

Wait, maybe I should try:
- SLATE (but has R? No, S-L-A-T-E, N is not here)
- CRANE (already used)
- BRANE (B-R-A-N-E, has R which is forbidden)
- GRANE (G-R-A-N-E, has R)
- FRANC (has R and C)
- PANIC (has R and C)
- MANIC (has R and C)

This is tricky. Maybe ""SLATE"" is similar but lacks N. Let me think differently - the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere.

Possible structure: _ _ _ N _ with A and E in 1,2,3,5 positions (but not original positions).

Let me try:
- E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- _ E A N _ → ? E A N ? (but E is already in word, A is 3rd)
- _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- A _ E N _ → A ? E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 1st)
- _ _ A N E → ? ? A N E (but E is 5th which was wrong)
- _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is 3rd, A is 5th - both could be correct)

The last option seems possible: _ _ E N A
Letters: E, N, A (all required), no C or R.
Possible words:
- B E E N A (not valid)
- D E E N A (not valid)
- F E E N A (not valid)
- G E E N A (not valid)
- H E E N A (not valid)
- L E E N A (not valid)
- M E E N A (not valid)
- P E E N A (not valid)
- S E E N A (not valid)
- T E E N A (not valid)
- V E E N A (not valid)
- W E E N A (not valid)
- Y E E N A (not valid)

None of these are valid. Maybe _ A E N _:
- B A E N ? (not valid)
- D A E N ? (not valid)
- F A E N ? (not valid)
- G A E N ? (not valid)
- H A E N ? (not valid)
- L A E N ? (not valid)
- M A E N ? (not valid)
- P A E N ? (not valid)
- S A E N ? (not valid)
- T A E N ? (not valid)
- V A E N ? (not valid)
- W A E N ? (not valid)
- Y A E N ? (not valid)

Also not valid. Maybe _ E _ N A:
- B E ? N A (but ? must be A or E, but A is already in word)
- D E ? N A (same)
- F E ? N A (same)
- G E ? N A (same)
- H E ? N A (same)
- L E ? N A (same)
- M E ? N A (same)
- P E ? N A (same)
- S E ? N A (same)
- T E ? N A (same)
- V E ? N A (same)
- W E ? N A (same)
- Y E ? N A (same)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try ""STANE"" again - even though A was 3rd and E was 5th, but this is the only common word with N in 4th containing A and E.

But ""STANE"" is S-T-A-N-E:
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but wrong position (was 3rd, now 3rd again - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but wrong position (was 5th, now 5th - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)

This suggests that in the secret word:
- N is 4th
- A is NOT 3rd
- E is NOT 5th

So possible positions:
- A could be 1, 2, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, or 3
- N is 4

Let me try to construct:
- A in 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E must be 2nd or 3rd
  - Example: A E _ N _ → A E ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
  - Possible: A E D N T (but not a word)

    - Possible: Y A E N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

- A in 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
  - E 1st: E _ _ N A
    - Example: E ? ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E S T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 2nd: _ E _ N A
    - Example: ? E ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S E T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 3rd: _ _ E N A
    - Example: ? ? E N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S T E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S P E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S V E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S W E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S Y E N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

This is proving difficult. Maybe ""STANE"" is the closest, but it reuses the same positions for A and E which would contradict the feedback. Let me try ""SLATE"" - but it lacks N in 4th.

Wait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it's obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.

Actually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that's not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it's a valid word (variant of stone).

Given the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let's try it:

STANE: S-T-A-N-E
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but not 5th (was -)

This would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they're same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.

I think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":

This seems valid - LEANT has:
- N in 4th ✓
- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)
- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)

But is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it's past tense of lean.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, L, T

Positions ruled out so far:

- E cannot be in slot 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 2 (from LEANT), so E must be in slot 1 or 3.

Slots 1, 2, 3, 5 still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, L, T).  
We also have no repeats of the known letters A, E, N unless a letter appears twice in the secret word.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: A in slot 1, E in slot 3  
Pattern: A _ E N _  
Remaining letters (not C, R, L, T, A, E, N) could be any other consonant or vowel.  
Possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C and R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the correct position (✓) at the 4th slot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _
Known letters: A, E, N
Forbidden letters: C, R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Contains both A and E somewhere else (not in their original positions: A not 3rd, E not 5th).
3. Does not contain C or R.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 3.

Let me brainstorm:
- If A is 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E could be 2nd or 3rd.
  - Example: A E _ N _ → AE?N? (but AE is not common start)
  - Example: A _ E N _ → A E N _? Not sure.
- If A is 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E could be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd.
  - Example: E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word)
- If A is 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - Example: E _ _ N A → E ? ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ E _ N A → ? E ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is already in word)

Wait, maybe I should look for words with N in 4th position, containing A and E, avoiding C and R.

Possible candidates:
- LANCE (but has C, forbidden)
- MANGE (has R? No, MANGE is M-A-N-G-E, but has G)
- PIANO (but has O, and N is 4th)
- STANE (has R? No, STANE is S-T-A-N-E, but E is last which was forbidden)
- TASTE (has R? No, T-A-S-T-E, but N is 4th here, not present)
- VENUE (has R? No, V-E-N-U-E, but N is 3rd, not 4th)
- WAGON (has R? No, W-A-G-O-N, N is 5th)
- MANTE (not a valid word)
- PIANO (already considered)
- STANE (S-T-A-N-E, N is 4th, A is 3rd which was wrong, E is 5th which was wrong - but this is same as CRANE feedback)
- TALON (has R? No, T-A-L-O-N, N is 5th)
- PANED (P-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- LANED (L-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- MANED (M-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)

Hmm, most common words with N in 4th seem to be like:
- STANE (but A is 3rd, E is 5th - both wrong positions)
- TALON (N is 5th)
- VENUE (N is 3rd)
- WAGON (N is 5th)

Wait, maybe I should try:
- SLATE (but has R? No, S-L-A-T-E, N is not here)
- CRANE (already used)
- BRANE (B-R-A-N-E, has R which is forbidden)
- GRANE (G-R-A-N-E, has R)
- FRANC (has R and C)
- PANIC (has R and C)
- MANIC (has R and C)

This is tricky. Maybe ""SLATE"" is similar but lacks N. Let me think differently - the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere.

Possible structure: _ _ _ N _ with A and E in 1,2,3,5 positions (but not original positions).

Let me try:
- E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- _ E A N _ → ? E A N ? (but E is already in word, A is 3rd)
- _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- A _ E N _ → A ? E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 1st)
- _ _ A N E → ? ? A N E (but E is 5th which was wrong)
- _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is 3rd, A is 5th - both could be correct)

The last option seems possible: _ _ E N A
Letters: E, N, A (all required), no C or R.
Possible words:
- B E E N A (not valid)
- D E E N A (not valid)
- F E E N A (not valid)
- G E E N A (not valid)
- H E E N A (not valid)
- L E E N A (not valid)

- S E E N A (not valid)
- T E E N A (not valid)
- V E E N A (not valid)
- W E E N A (not valid)
- Y E E N A (not valid)

None of these are valid. Maybe _ A E N _:
- B A E N ? (not valid)
- D A E N ? (not valid)
- F A E N ? (not valid)
- G A E N ? (not valid)
- H A E N ? (not valid)
- L A E N ? (not valid)

- P A E N ? (not valid)
- S A E N ? (not valid)
- T A E N ? (not valid)
- V A E N ? (not valid)
- W A E N ? (not valid)
- Y A E N ? (not valid)

Also not valid. Maybe _ E _ N A:
- B E ? N A (but ? must be A or E, but A is already in word)
- D E ? N A (same)
- F E ? N A (same)
- G E ? N A (same)
- H E ? N A (same)
- L E ? N A (same)
- M E ? N A (same)
- P E ? N A (same)
- S E ? N A (same)
- T E ? N A (same)
- V E ? N A (same)
- W E ? N A (same)
- Y E ? N A (same)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try ""STANE"" again - even though A was 3rd and E was 5th, but this is the only common word with N in 4th containing A and E.

But ""STANE"" is S-T-A-N-E:
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but wrong position (was 3rd, now 3rd again - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but wrong position (was 5th, now 5th - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)

This suggests that in the secret word:
- N is 4th
- A is NOT 3rd
- E is NOT 5th

So possible positions:
- A could be 1, 2, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, or 3
- N is 4

Wait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it's obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.

Actually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that's not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it's a valid word (variant of stone).

Given the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let's try it:

STANE: S-T-A-N-E
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but not 5th (was -)

This would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they're same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.

I think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":
- L: ?
- E: ?
- A: ?
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- T: ?

But LEANT is L-E-A-N-T:
- A is 3rd (was - in CRANE)
- E is 2nd (was - in CRANE)
- N is 4th ✓
- No C or R

This seems valid - LEANT has:
- N in 4th ✓
- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)
- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)

But is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it's past tense of lean.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, L, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, E, N  
Fixed position: N is at slot 4 ( _ _ _ N _ )

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in slot 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 3 again (from LEANT), so A must be in slot 1, 2, or 5.
- E cannot be in slot 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 2 (from LEANT), so E must be in slot 1 or 3.

Slots 1, 2, 3, 5 still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, L, T).  
We also have no repeats of the known letters A, E, N unless a letter appears twice in the secret word.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: A in slot 1, E in slot 3  
Pattern: A _ E N _  
Remaining letters (not C, R, L, T, A, E, N) could be any other consonant or vowel.  
Possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U  

A quick scan of common words gives:  
- A B E N D  → ABEND (not a valid English word)  
- A M E N D  → AMEND (valid)  
- A S E N D  → ASSEND (invalid)  
- A G E N D  → AGEND (invalid)  
AMEND fits perfectly and uses only allowed letters.

Case 2: E in slot 1, A in slot 2  
Pattern: E A _ N _  
Possible words:  
- E A G N E (invalid)  
- E A S N E (invalid)  
- E A M N E (invalid)  
- E A P N E (invalid)  
No common valid words here.

Case 3: E in slot 1, A in slot 5  
Pattern: E _ _ N A  
Possible words:  
- E S T N A (invalid)  
- E S P N A (invalid)  
- E S G N A (invalid)  
No valid words.

Case 4: A in slot 2, E in slot 3  
Pattern: _ A E N _  
Possible words:  
- S A E N D (invalid)  
- M A E N D (invalid)  
- P A E N D (invalid)  
No valid words.

Case 5: A in slot 5, E in slot 1  
Pattern: E _ _ N A  
Same as Case 3, no valid words.

Thus the only plausible candidate is AMEND.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- STARE
- AROSE

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters that appear in many 5-letter words, which should help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C and R are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the correct position (✓) at the 4th slot.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ N _
Known letters: A, E, N
Forbidden letters: C, R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in the 4th position.
2. Contains both A and E somewhere else (not in their original positions: A not 3rd, E not 5th).
3. Does not contain C or R.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 4 is N), so 1, 2, or 3.

Let me brainstorm:
- If A is 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E could be 2nd or 3rd.
  - Example: A E _ N _ → AE?N? (but AE is not common start)
  - Example: A _ E N _ → A E N _? Not sure.
- If A is 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E could be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd.
  - Example: E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word)
- If A is 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  - Example: E _ _ N A → E ? ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ E _ N A → ? E ? N A (but E is already in word)
  - Example: _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is already in word)

Wait, maybe I should look for words with N in 4th position, containing A and E, avoiding C and R.

Possible candidates:
- LANCE (but has C, forbidden)
- MANGE (has R? No, MANGE is M-A-N-G-E, but has G)
- PIANO (but has O, and N is 4th)
- STANE (has R? No, STANE is S-T-A-N-E, but E is last which was forbidden)
- TASTE (has R? No, T-A-S-T-E, but N is 4th here, not present)
- VENUE (has R? No, V-E-N-U-E, but N is 3rd, not 4th)
- WAGON (has R? No, W-A-G-O-N, N is 5th)
- MANTE (not a valid word)
- PIANO (already considered)
- STANE (S-T-A-N-E, N is 4th, A is 3rd which was wrong, E is 5th which was wrong - but this is same as CRANE feedback)
- TALON (has R? No, T-A-L-O-N, N is 5th)
- PANED (P-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- LANED (L-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)
- MANED (M-A-N-E-D, N is 3rd)

Hmm, most common words with N in 4th seem to be like:
- STANE (but A is 3rd, E is 5th - both wrong positions)
- TALON (N is 5th)
- VENUE (N is 3rd)
- WAGON (N is 5th)

Wait, maybe I should try:
- SLATE (but has R? No, S-L-A-T-E, N is not here)
- CRANE (already used)
- BRANE (B-R-A-N-E, has R which is forbidden)
- GRANE (G-R-A-N-E, has R)
- FRANC (has R and C)
- PANIC (has R and C)
- MANIC (has R and C)

This is tricky. Maybe ""SLATE"" is similar but lacks N. Let me think differently - the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere.

Possible structure: _ _ _ N _ with A and E in 1,2,3,5 positions (but not original positions).

Let me try:
- E A _ N _ → E A ? N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- _ E A N _ → ? E A N ? (but E is already in word, A is 3rd)
- _ A E N _ → ? A E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 2nd)
- A _ E N _ → A ? E N ? (but E is already in word, A is 1st)
- _ _ A N E → ? ? A N E (but E is 5th which was wrong)
- _ _ E N A → ? ? E N A (but E is 3rd, A is 5th - both could be correct)

The last option seems possible: _ _ E N A
Letters: E, N, A (all required), no C or R.
Possible words:
- B E E N A (not valid)
- D E E N A (not valid)
- F E E N A (not valid)
- G E E N A (not valid)
- H E E N A (not valid)
- L E E N A (not valid)
- M E E N A (not valid)
- P E E N A (not valid)
- S E E N A (not valid)
- T E E N A (not valid)
- V E E N A (not valid)
- W E E N A (not valid)
- Y E E N A (not valid)

None of these are valid. Maybe _ A E N _:
- B A E N ? (not valid)
- D A E N ? (not valid)
- F A E N ? (not valid)
- G A E N ? (not valid)
- H A E N ? (not valid)
- L A E N ? (not valid)
- M A E N ? (not valid)
- P A E N ? (not valid)
- S A E N ? (not valid)
- T A E N ? (not valid)
- V A E N ? (not valid)
- W A E N ? (not valid)
- Y A E N ? (not valid)

Also not valid. Maybe _ E _ N A:
- B E ? N A (but ? must be A or E, but A is already in word)
- D E ? N A (same)
- F E ? N A (same)
- G E ? N A (same)
- H E ? N A (same)
- L E ? N A (same)
- M E ? N A (same)
- P E ? N A (same)
- S E ? N A (same)
- T E ? N A (same)
- V E ? N A (same)
- W E ? N A (same)
- Y E ? N A (same)

None of these seem valid. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try ""STANE"" again - even though A was 3rd and E was 5th, but this is the only common word with N in 4th containing A and E.

But ""STANE"" is S-T-A-N-E:
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but wrong position (was 3rd, now 3rd again - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but wrong position (was 5th, now 5th - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)

This suggests that in the secret word:
- N is 4th
- A is NOT 3rd
- E is NOT 5th

So possible positions:
- A could be 1, 2, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, or 3
- N is 4

Let me try to construct:
- A in 1st: A _ _ N _
  - E must be 2nd or 3rd
  - Example: A E _ N _ → A E ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
  - Possible: A E D N T (but not a word)
  - Possible: A E G N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E M N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E S N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E L N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E P N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E V N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E W N T (not a word)
  - Possible: A E Y N T (not a word)
  - None seem valid.

- A in 2nd: _ A _ N _
  - E must be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd
  - E 1st: E A _ N _
    - Example: E A ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E A S N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A M N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A P N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A V N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A W N T (not a word)
    - Possible: E A Y N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 3rd: _ A E N _
    - Example: ? A E N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: M A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: P A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: T A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: V A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: W A E N T (not a word)
    - Possible: Y A E N T (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

- A in 5th: _ _ _ N A
  - E must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
  - E 1st: E _ _ N A
    - Example: E ? ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: E S T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: E S Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 2nd: _ E _ N A
    - Example: ? E ? N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S E T N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E L N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E P N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E V N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E W N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S E Y N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.
  - E 3rd: _ _ E N A
    - Example: ? ? E N A (but ? must be letters not C,R)
    - Possible: S T E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S P E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S V E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S W E N A (not a word)
    - Possible: S Y E N A (not a word)
    - None seem valid.

This is proving difficult. Maybe ""STANE"" is the closest, but it reuses the same positions for A and E which would contradict the feedback. Let me try ""SLATE"" - but it lacks N in 4th.

Wait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it's obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.

Actually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that's not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it's a valid word (variant of stone).

Given the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let's try it:

STANE: S-T-A-N-E
- S: ?
- T: ?
- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- E: in word but not 5th (was -)

This would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they're same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.

I think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":
- L: ?
- E: ?
- A: ?
- N: correct position (4th) ✓
- T: ?

But LEANT is L-E-A-N-T:
- A is 3rd (was - in CRANE)
- E is 2nd (was - in CRANE)
- N is 4th ✓
- No C or R

This seems valid - LEANT has:
- N in 4th ✓
- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)
- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it's a new position)

But is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it's past tense of lean.

Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, L, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, E, N  
Fixed position: N is at slot 4 ( _ _ _ N _ )

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in slot 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 3 again (from LEANT), so A must be in slot 1, 2, or 5.
- E cannot be in slot 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 2 (from LEANT), so E must be in slot 1 or 3.

Slots 1, 2, 3, 5 still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, L, T).  
We also have no repeats of the known letters A, E, N unless a letter appears twice in the secret word.

Let’s build candidate patterns:

Case 1: A in slot 1, E in slot 3  
Pattern: A _ E N _  
Remaining letters (not C, R, L, T, A, E, N) could be any other consonant or vowel.  
Possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U  

A quick scan of common words gives:  
- A B E N D  → ABEND (not a valid English word)  
- A M E N D  → AMEND (valid)  
- A S E N D  → ASSEND (invalid)  
- A G E N D  → AGEND (invalid)  
AMEND fits perfectly and uses only allowed letters.

Case 2: E in slot 1, A in slot 2  
Pattern: E A _ N _  
Possible words:  
- E A G N E (invalid)  
- E A S N E (invalid)  
- E A M N E (invalid)  
- E A P N E (invalid)  
No common valid words here.

Case 3: E in slot 1, A in slot 5  
Pattern: E _ _ N A  
Possible words:  
- E S T N A (invalid)  
- E S P N A (invalid)  
- E S G N A (invalid)  
No valid words.

Case 4: A in slot 2, E in slot 3  
Pattern: _ A E N _  
Possible words:  
- S A E N D (invalid)  
- M A E N D (invalid)  
- P A E N D (invalid)  
No valid words.

Case 5: A in slot 5, E in slot 1  
Pattern: E _ _ N A  
Same as Case 3, no valid words.

Thus the only plausible candidate is AMEND.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Known letters and positions:
- A is in slot 1 (✓)
- N is in slot 4 (✓)
- E is in slot 3 (✓)

So the pattern is: A _ E N _

Known absent letters: C, R, L, T, M, D

Slots 2 and 5 are still open; they must be filled with letters not in the banned set and not already used (A, E, N).

Available letters (excluding banned and the three known): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need common 5-letter words that fit A _ E N _.

Quick scan:
- A B E N _  → ABEND (invalid)
- A F E N _  → AFEN_ (invalid)
- A G E N _  → AGENT (valid, G and T; but T is banned)
- A H E N _  → AHENS (invalid)
- A I E N _  → AIENS (invalid)
- A K E N _  → AKENS (invalid)
- A P E N _  → APENS (invalid)
- A S E N _  → ASHEN (valid, S and H; both allowed)
- A V E N _  → AVENS (valid, V and S; both allowed)
- A W E N _  → AWENS (invalid)
- A Y E N _  → AYENS (invalid)

Between ASHEN and AVENS, both fit perfectly. ASHEN is slightly more common, so I'll choose that.

Let me try ""STANE"" again - even though A was 3rd and E was 5th, but this is the only common word with N in 4th containing A and E.\n\nBut ""STANE"" is S-T-A-N-E:\n- S: ?\n- T: ?\n- A: in word but wrong position (was 3rd, now 3rd again - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)\n- N: correct position (4th) ✓\n- E: in word but wrong position (was 5th, now 5th - same position, which would get ✓, but it got -)\n\nThis suggests that in the secret word:\n- N is 4th\n- A is NOT 3rd\n- E is NOT 5th\n\nSo possible positions:\n- A could be 1, 2, or 5\n- E could be 1, 2, or 3\n- N is 4\n\nLet me try to construct:\n- A in 1st: A _ _ N _\n  - E must be 2nd or 3rd\n  - Example: A E _ N _ → A E ? N ? (but ? must be letters not C,R)\n  - Possible: A E D N T (but not a word)\n  - Possible: A E G N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E M N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E S N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E L N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E P N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E V N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E W N T (not a word)\n  - Possible: A E Y N T (not a word)\n  - None seem valid.\n\n- A in 2nd: _ A _ N _\n  - E must be 1st, 2nd (but A is there), or 3rd\n  - E 1st: E A _ N _\n    - Example: E A ?

Maybe ""STANE"" is the closest, but it reuses the same positions for A and E which would contradict the feedback. Let me try ""SLATE"" - but it lacks N in 4th.\n\nWait, the word must have N in 4th, and contain A and E elsewhere. The only common word I can think of is ""STANE"" (as in stane) but it\'s obscure. Another possibility is ""STANE"" variants or ""STANE"" is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""TALON"" has N in 5th, not 4th. ""VENUE"" has N in 3rd. ""WAGON"" has N in 5th.\n\nActually, let me think of ""MANTE"" - but that\'s not a valid word. ""LANTE"" - not valid. ""PANET"" - not valid.\n\nThis seems impossible with common words. Maybe ""STANE"" is the only possible, but it\'s not ideal. Alternatively, ""STANE"" might be acceptable as it\'s a valid word (variant of stone).\n\nGiven the constraints, ""STANE"" seems the closest, but let\'s try it:\n\nSTANE: S-T-A-N-E\n- S: ?\n- T: ?\n- A: in word but not 3rd (was -)\n- N: correct position (4th) ✓\n- E: in word but not 5th (was -)\n\nThis would fit if the secret word is S-T-?-N-E with A and E present but positions changed. But since A was 3rd and E 5th, and now they\'re same positions, this suggests STANE is not the answer.\n\nI think I need to find a word with N in 4th, A and E elsewhere, avoiding C and R. Let me try ""LEANT"":\n- L: ?\n- E: ?\n- A: ?\n- N: correct position (4th) ✓\n- T: ?\n\nBut LEANT is L-E-A-N-T:\n- A is 3rd (was - in CRANE)\n- E is 2nd (was - in CRANE)\n- N is 4th ✓\n- No C or R\n\nThis seems valid - LEANT has:\n- N in 4th ✓\n- A in 3rd (but was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it\'s a new position)\n- E in 2nd (was - in CRANE, so this is allowed as it\'s a new position)\n\nBut is LEANT a valid word? Yes, it\'s past tense of lean.\n\n<guess>LEANT</guess>\n\n<guess>LEANT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\nLetters that are NOT in the word: C, R, L, T  \nLetters that ARE in the word: A, E, N  \nFixed position: N is at slot 4 ( _ _ _ N _ )\n\nPositions ruled out so far:\n- A cannot be in slot 3 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 3 again (from LEANT), so A must be in slot 1, 2, or 5.\n- E cannot be in slot 5 (from CRANE) and cannot be in slot 2 (from LEANT), so E must be in slot 1 or 3.\n\nSlots 1, 2, 3, 5 still need to be filled with letters not yet eliminated (no C, R, L, T).  \nWe also have no repeats of the known letters A, E, N unless a letter appears twice in the secret word.\n\nLet’s build candidate patterns:\n\nCase 1: A in slot 1, E in slot 3  \nPattern: A _ E N _  \nRemaining letters (not C, R, L, T, A, E, N) could be any other consonant or vowel.  \nPossible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, S, V, W, Y, Z  \nVowels left: I, O, U  \n\nA quick scan of common words gives:  \n- A B E N D  → ABEND (not a valid English word)  \n- A M E N D  → AMEND (valid)  \n- A S E N D  → ASSEND (invalid)  \n- A G E N D  → AGEND (invalid)  \nAMEND fits perfectly and uses only allowed letters.\n\nCase 2: E in slot 1, A in slot 2  \nPattern: E A _ N _  \nPossible words:  \n- E A G N E (invalid)  \n- E A S N E (invalid)  \n- E A M N E (invalid)  \n- E A P N E (invalid)  \nNo common valid words here.\n\nCase 3: E in slot 1, A in slot 5  \nPattern: E _ _ N A  \nPossible words:  \n- E S T N A (invalid)  \n- E S P N A (invalid)  \n- E S G N A (invalid)  \nNo valid words.\n\nCase 4: A in slot 2, E in slot 3  \nPattern: _ A E N _  \nPossible words:  \n- S A E N D (invalid)  \n- M A E N D (invalid)  \n- P A E N D (invalid)  \nNo valid words.\n\nCase 5: A in slot 5, E in slot 1  \nPattern: E _ _ N A  \nSame as Case 3, no valid words.\n\nThus the only plausible candidate is AMEND.\n\n<guess>AMEND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(-) A(-) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: AMEND -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) E(✓) N(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the three rounds of feedback we now have:\n\nKnown letters and positions:\n- A is in slot 1 (✓)\n- N is in slot 4 (✓)\n- E is in slot 3 (✓)\n\nSo the pattern is: A _ E N _\n\nKnown absent letters: C, R, L, T, M, D\n\nSlots 2 and 5 are still open; they must be filled with letters not in the banned set and not already used (A, E, N).\n\nAvailable letters (excluding banned and the three known): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need common 5-letter words that fit A _ E N _.\n\nQuick scan:\n- A B E N _  → ABEND (invalid)\n- A F E N _  → AFEN_ (invalid)\n- A G E N _  → AGENT (valid, G and T; but T is banned)\n- A H E N _  → AHENS (invalid)\n- A I E N _  → AIENS (invalid)\n- A K E N _  → AKENS (invalid)\n- A P E N _  → APENS (invalid)\n- A S E N _  → ASHEN (valid, S and H; both allowed)\n- A V E N _  → AVENS (valid, V and S; both allowed)\n- A W E N _  → AWENS (invalid)\n- A Y E N _  → AYENS (invalid)\n\nBetween ASHEN and AVENS, both fit perfectly.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Slots and certainties:
1: A (✓ fixed)
3: E (✓ fixed)
4: N (✓ fixed)

So the pattern is: A _ E N _

Feedback on remaining letters:
- S appeared in slot 2 and got “-” (present but wrong place).  
  Therefore S is in the word, but not in slot 2.  
  The only open slot left is slot 5, so S must be in slot 5.

That locks slot 5 as S:   A _ E N S

Slot 2 is still empty; it must be a letter not yet ruled out and not already used (A, E, N, S).  
Banned letters so far: C, R, L, T, M, D, H  
(From feedback: H got “x”, so H is out.)

Available letters for slot 2: B, F, G, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common English word of the form A ? E N S.

Quick check:
- A B E N S → ABENS (invalid)
- A F E N S → AFENS (invalid)
- A G E N S → AGENS (invalid)
- A I E N S → AIENS (invalid)
- A K E N S → K is allowed, but AKENS is invalid
- A P E N S → APENS (invalid)
- A V E N S → AVENS (valid, V is allowed)
- A W E N S → AWENS (invalid)
- A Y E N S → AYENS (invalid)

The only valid candidate is AVENS.
