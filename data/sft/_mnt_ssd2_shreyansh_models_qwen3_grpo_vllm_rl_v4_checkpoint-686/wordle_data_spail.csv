For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word would use several of these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants, and all letters are among the most frequent. This should provide maximum information regardless of the actual secret word.

From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are excluded.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - S is correctly placed in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N, T are excluded.

3. SCALD → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(-) D(x)
   - S(✓) position 1, A(✓) position 3 confirmed.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C and D are excluded.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (pos 1), A (pos 3)
- Letters in word but wrong position: L (not pos 2, not pos 4)
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, N, T, C, D

So L must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 4).

Thus the word must be: S _ A _ L

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet excluded. Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try common combinations:
- Position 2: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting S _ A _ L:
- SHAL_ - but SHAL_ isn't a word.
- SPASM - but that's 5 letters: S P A S M. However, S is already in pos 1, and we don't know about S in pos 4 yet. But SPASM has S in pos 4 which we don't know about.
- SKAMP - S K A M P, but we need L at pos 5.
- SKAL_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.
- SVAL_ - SVAL_ isn't a word.
- SIAL_ - SIAL_ isn't a word.
- SIMPL - SIMPL isn't a word.
- SABYL - SABYL is a word (variant of Sabine), but let's check: S A B Y L. This fits S _ A _ L pattern with B and Y.

But let's think of more common words. Another approach is to list all possible S _ A _ L words with remaining letters.

Looking at common words:
- S P A C E - but C and E are excluded.
- S W A M P - but P is ok, but we need L at pos 5.
- S H A R E - but R and E are excluded.
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A R K - but R is excluded.
- S P A C E - C and E excluded.
- S K A L_ - no.
- S W A L L - SWALL is archaic but valid.
- S P A L L - SPALL is a word meaning to chip or flake.

SPALL fits:
- S P A L L
- Pattern: S _ A _ L (pos 1,3,5 correct)
- P and L are new letters to test.

But L is already known to be in the word (from L(-) in previous guesses), so SPALL uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Another option: SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a valid word.
SIAL_ - no.
SABYL - SABYL is a word (ancient Greek/Sabine princess).

Between SPALL and SABYL, SPALL seems more common.

But let's verify SPALL:
- S P A L L
- S(✓) position 1
- P - new letter
- A(✓) position 3
- L - must be in position 5 (as deduced)
- Second L - allowed

Thus, SPALL is a valid guess.

But wait, SPALL is S P A L L, which has L in positions 4 and 5. But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from SCALD feedback: L(-) meaning L is in word but not in position 4). Thus SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked as (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 marked (-) and L in position 5 marked (✓). But the feedback for SCALD shows L(-) in position 4, meaning L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be a new letter.

Wait, no - SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked (-) as in SCALD, but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 (marked (-)) and L in position 5 (marked ✓). But the feedback for SCALD already showed L(-) in position 4, so SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be L which is (-) as in SCALD. But this seems contradictory because in SPALL, position 4 is L which would be (-), but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL cannot be correct as it places L in position 4 which would be marked (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5.

Thus the correct pattern is S _ A _ L with L only in position 5. Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with remaining letters.

Looking for S _ A _ L words:
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A K L - no.
- S B A K L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S W A M L - no.
- S Y A K L - no.

This seems limited. Another approach: position 2 and 4 can be any remaining letters, but we need a valid word.

Looking at possible combinations:
- S B A K L - no.
- S B A M L - no.
- S B A P L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S H A P L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S I A P L - no.
- S K A M P - but needs L at 5.
- S K A P L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S M A P L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S P A M L - no.
- S P A R K - but R excluded.
- S W A M P - but needs L at 5.

This seems difficult. Maybe S K A L_ isn't a word, but S K A L is a word (Scots for a narrow path). However, it's 4 letters.

Looking back, perhaps S H A L_ - SHAL_ isn't a word.
S P A L_ - SPAL_ isn't a word.
S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
S W A L_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.

This suggests that with current constraints, the only possible word is S P A L L, but as noted, L in position 4 would be (-), which is acceptable since we know L is in word but not in position 4. However, SPALL has L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 is L which would be (-), matching our feedback.

Thus, SPALL is the most plausible next guess.

<guess>SPALL</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we have:
- S correctly placed in position 1
- A correctly placed in position 3
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4
- Therefore L must be in position 5
- The remaining letters to test for positions 2 and 4 are from the unused pool excluding R,O,E,N,T,C,D

The only common 5-letter word fitting S _ A _ L with these constraints is SPALL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word would use several of these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants, and all letters are among the most frequent. This should provide maximum information regardless of the actual secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters definitely present: A, S
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, E.
3. Places A and S in different positions than before.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good candidate letters left: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word that fits: SLANT
- S in position 1 (was position 4, so new position)
- L, A, N, T are new letters to test
- Does not contain R, O, E
- A is in position 2 (was position 1, so new position)

Possible word structures:

SCALD uses D (not excluded) and fits the pattern. Let's check:

- Letters excluded: R, O, E, N, T, C, D

So L must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 4).

Thus the word must be: S _ A _ L

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet excluded. Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try common combinations:
- Position 2: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting S _ A _ L:
- SHAL_ - but SHAL_ isn't a word.
- SPASM - but that's 5 letters: S P A S M. However, S is already in pos 1, and we don't know about S in pos 4 yet. But SPASM has S in pos 4 which we don't know about.
- SKAMP - S K A M P, but we need L at pos 5.
- SKAL_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.
- SVAL_ - SVAL_ isn't a word.
- SIAL_ - SIAL_ isn't a word.
- SIMPL - SIMPL isn't a word.
- SABYL - SABYL is a word (variant of Sabine), but let's check: S A B Y L. This fits S _ A _ L pattern with B and Y.

But let's think of more common words. Another approach is to list all possible S _ A _ L words with remaining letters.

Looking at common words:
- S P A C E - but C and E are excluded.
- S W A M P - but P is ok, but we need L at pos 5.
- S H A R E - but R and E are excluded.
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A R K - but R is excluded.
- S P A C E - C and E excluded.
- S K A L_ - no.
- S W A L L - SWALL is archaic but valid.
- S P A L L - SPALL is a word meaning to chip or flake.

SPALL fits:
- S P A L L
- Pattern: S _ A _ L (pos 1,3,5 correct)
- P and L are new letters to test.

But L is already known to be in the word (from L(-) in previous guesses), so SPALL uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Another option: SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a valid word.
SIAL_ - no.
SABYL - SABYL is a word (ancient Greek/Sabine princess).

Between SPALL and SABYL, SPALL seems more common.

But let's verify SPALL:
- S P A L L
- S(✓) position 1
- P - new letter
- A(✓) position 3
- L - must be in position 5 (as deduced)
- Second L - allowed

Thus, SPALL is a valid guess.

But wait, SPALL is S P A L L, which has L in positions 4 and 5. But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from SCALD feedback: L(-) meaning L is in word but not in position 4). Thus SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked as (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 marked (-) and L in position 5 marked (✓). But the feedback for SCALD shows L(-) in position 4, meaning L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be a new letter.

Wait, no - SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked (-) as in SCALD, but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 (marked (-)) and L in position 5 (marked ✓). But the feedback for SCALD already showed L(-) in position 4, so SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be L which is (-) as in SCALD. But this seems contradictory because in SPALL, position 4 is L which would be (-), but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL cannot be correct as it places L in position 4 which would be marked (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5.

Thus the correct pattern is S _ A _ L with L only in position 5. Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with remaining letters.

Looking for S _ A _ L words:
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A K L - no.
- S B A K L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S W A M L - no.
- S Y A K L - no.

This seems limited. Another approach: position 2 and 4 can be any remaining letters, but we need a valid word.

Looking at possible combinations:
- S B A K L - no.
- S B A M L - no.
- S B A P L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S H A P L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S I A P L - no.
- S K A M P - but needs L at 5.
- S K A P L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S M A P L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S P A M L - no.
- S P A R K - but R excluded.
- S W A M P - but needs L at 5.

This seems difficult. Maybe S K A L_ isn't a word, but S K A L is a word (Scots for a narrow path). However, it's 4 letters.

Looking back, perhaps S H A L_ - SHAL_ isn't a word.
S P A L_ - SPAL_ isn't a word.
S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
S W A L_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.

This suggests that with current constraints, the only possible word is S P A L L, but as noted, L in position 4 would be (-), which is acceptable since we know L is in word but not in position 4. However, SPALL has L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 is L which would be (-), matching our feedback.

Thus, SPALL is the most plausible next guess.

<guess>SPALL</guess>Based on the feedback so far, we have:
- S correctly placed in position 1
- A correctly placed in position 3
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4
- Therefore L must be in position 5
- The remaining letters to test for positions 2 and 4 are from the unused pool excluding R,O,E,N,T,C,D

The only common 5-letter word fitting S _ A _ L with these constraints is SPALL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word would use several of these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants, and all letters are among the most frequent. This should provide maximum information regardless of the actual secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters definitely present: A, S
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, E.
3. Places A and S in different positions than before.
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good candidate letters left: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A word that fits: SLANT
- S in position 1 (was position 4, so new position)
- L, A, N, T are new letters to test
- Does not contain R, O, E
- A is in position 2 (was position 1, so new position)

This seems like a strong next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - S is correctly placed in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (pos 1), A (pos 3)
- Letters in word but wrong position: L (not pos 2), A (already fixed at pos 3), S (already fixed at pos 1)
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, N, T

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 4-5 with letters not yet ruled out, and ensure L appears somewhere (but not in position 2).

Possible word structures:
S [L or other] A [L or other] [remaining letters]

Let's try placing L in position 4: S _ A L _
Then position 2 could be any unused common letter, say C: S C A L _
Position 5 needs a letter not yet used. Good candidates: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

SCALD uses D (not excluded) and fits the pattern. Let's check:
- S(✓) C A(✓) L S(✓) - but we need 5 letters. SCALD is 5 letters: S C A L D.

This seems valid:
- S in pos 1 (correct)
- A in pos 3 (correct)
- L in pos 4 (was in pos 2, now new position)
- C and D are new letters to test.

Alternative: SCAMP, SCALE, SCALP, etc., but SCALD seems good as it tests D.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are excluded.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - S is correctly placed in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N, T are excluded.

3. SCALD → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(-) D(x)
   - S(✓) position 1, A(✓) position 3 confirmed.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C and D are excluded.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (pos 1), A (pos 3)
- Letters in word but wrong position: L (not pos 2, not pos 4)
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, N, T, C, D

So L must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 4).

Thus the word must be: S _ A _ L

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet excluded. Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try common combinations:
- Position 2: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y
- Position 4: same set

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting S _ A _ L:
- SHAL_ - but SHAL_ isn't a word.
- SPASM - but that's 5 letters: S P A S M. However, S is already in pos 1, and we don't know about S in pos 4 yet. But SPASM has S in pos 4 which we don't know about.
- SKAMP - S K A M P, but we need L at pos 5.
- SKAL_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.
- SVAL_ - SVAL_ isn't a word.
- SIAL_ - SIAL_ isn't a word.
- SIMPL - SIMPL isn't a word.
- SABYL - SABYL is a word (variant of Sabine), but let's check: S A B Y L. This fits S _ A _ L pattern with B and Y.

But let's think of more common words. Another approach is to list all possible S _ A _ L words with remaining letters.

Looking at common words:
- S P A C E - but C and E are excluded.
- S W A M P - but P is ok, but we need L at pos 5.
- S H A R E - but R and E are excluded.
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A R K - but R is excluded.
- S P A C E - C and E excluded.
- S K A L_ - no.
- S W A L L - SWALL is archaic but valid.
- S P A L L - SPALL is a word meaning to chip or flake.

SPALL fits:
- S P A L L
- Pattern: S _ A _ L (pos 1,3,5 correct)
- P and L are new letters to test.

But L is already known to be in the word (from L(-) in previous guesses), so SPALL uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Another option: SWAL_ - SWAL_ isn't a valid word.
SIAL_ - no.
SABYL - SABYL is a word (ancient Greek/Sabine princess).

Between SPALL and SABYL, SPALL seems more common.

But let's verify SPALL:
- S P A L L
- S(✓) position 1
- P - new letter
- A(✓) position 3
- L - must be in position 5 (as deduced)
- Second L - allowed

Thus, SPALL is a valid guess.

But wait, SPALL is S P A L L, which has L in positions 4 and 5. But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from SCALD feedback: L(-) meaning L is in word but not in position 4). Thus SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked as (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 marked (-) and L in position 5 marked (✓). But the feedback for SCALD shows L(-) in position 4, meaning L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be a new letter.

Wait, no - SPALL has L in position 4 which would be marked (-) as in SCALD, but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL would have L in position 4 (marked (-)) and L in position 5 (marked ✓). But the feedback for SCALD already showed L(-) in position 4, so SPALL would be possible as the word would have L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 would be L which is (-) as in SCALD. But this seems contradictory because in SPALL, position 4 is L which would be (-), but we know L is in word but not in position 4. Thus SPALL cannot be correct as it places L in position 4 which would be marked (-), but we already know L is in word and must be in position 5.

Thus the correct pattern is S _ A _ L with L only in position 5. Now we need to fill positions 2 and 4 with remaining letters.

Looking for S _ A _ L words:
- S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
- S P A K L - no.
- S B A K L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S W A M L - no.
- S Y A K L - no.

This seems limited. Another approach: position 2 and 4 can be any remaining letters, but we need a valid word.

Looking at possible combinations:
- S B A K L - no.
- S B A M L - no.
- S B A P L - no.
- S F A K L - no.
- S G A M L - no.
- S H A M L - no.
- S H A P L - no.
- S I A M L - no.
- S I A P L - no.
- S K A M P - but needs L at 5.
- S K A P L - no.
- S M A K L - no.
- S M A P L - no.
- S P A K L - no.
- S P A M L - no.
- S P A R K - but R excluded.
- S W A M P - but needs L at 5.

This seems difficult. Maybe S K A L_ isn't a word, but S K A L is a word (Scots for a narrow path). However, it's 4 letters.

Looking back, perhaps S H A L_ - SHAL_ isn't a word.
S P A L_ - SPAL_ isn't a word.
S K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.
S W A L_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.

This suggests that with current constraints, the only possible word is S P A L L, but as noted, L in position 4 would be (-), which is acceptable since we know L is in word but not in position 4. However, SPALL has L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 is L which would be (-), matching our feedback.

Thus, SPALL is the most plausible next guess.

<guess>SPALL</guess>Based on the feedback so far, we have:
- S correctly placed in position 1
- A correctly placed in position 3
- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4
- Therefore L must be in position 5
- The remaining letters to test for positions 2 and 4 are from the unused pool excluding R,O,E,N,T,C,D

The only common 5-letter word fitting S _ A _ L with these constraints is SPALL.

<|im_end|>

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are excluded.

2. SLANT → S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - S is correctly placed in position 1.
   - A is correctly placed in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N, T are excluded.

3. SCALD → S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(-) D(x)
   - S(✓) position 1, A(✓) position 3 confirmed.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C, D excluded.

4. SPALL → S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓)
   - S(✓) position 1, P(✓) position 2, A(✓) position 3 confirmed.
   - L(-) position 4: L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - L(✓) position 5: L is correctly placed in position 5.

So the word pattern is now:
S P A _ L

Only position 4 is unknown. From previous exclusions, the letters not in the word are: R, O, E, N, T, C, D.

Remaining candidate letters for position 4: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching S P A _ L:
- SPASM - S P A S M, but M is allowed.
- SPALL - already guessed, L is correct at 5.
- SPARE - E excluded.
- SPASM - fits S P A S M.

SPASM is a valid word and uses S (already confirmed) in position 4, which is allowed since we only know S is in the word but not in position 4 (from AROSE feedback). However, in SPALL, S was not in position 4, so S could still be in position 4.

But SPASM has S in position 4, which is allowed. Let's check if SPASM fits all constraints:
- S P A S M
- S(✓) position 1, P(✓) position 2, A(✓) position 3, S in position 4 (not excluded), M in position 5 (not excluded).

This seems valid.

Another candidate: SPANK - but N is excluded.
SPARK - R is excluded.
SPASM - seems best.

<guess>SPASM</guess>Based on the latest feedback:
- S P A are locked in positions 1-3.
- L is in position 5 but not in position 4.
- The only remaining unknown is position 4.
- Valid remaining letters for position 4 (excluding already excluded letters) include S, M, etc.

The word must be S P A _ L, and the only common word fitting this is SPASM.

Another approach: position 2 and 4 can be any remaining letters, but we need a valid word.\n\nLooking at possible combinations:\n- S B A K L - no.\n- S B A M L - no.\n- S B A P L - no.\n- S F A K L - no.\n- S G A M L - no.\n- S H A M L - no.\n- S H A P L - no.\n- S I A M L - no.\n- S I A P L - no.\n- S K A M P - but needs L at 5.\n- S K A P L - no.\n- S M A K L - no.\n- S M A P L - no.\n- S P A K L - no.\n- S P A M L - no.\n- S P A R K - but R excluded.\n- S W A M P - but needs L at 5.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe S K A L_ isn't a word, but S K A L is a word (Scots for a narrow path). However, it's 4 letters.\n\nLooking back, perhaps S H A L_ - SHAL_ isn't a word.\nS P A L_ - SPAL_ isn't a word.\nS K A L_ - SKAL_ isn't a word.\nS W A L_ - SWAL_ isn't a word.\n\nThis suggests that with current constraints, the only possible word is S P A L L, but as noted, L in position 4 would be (-), which is acceptable since we know L is in word but not in position 4. However, SPALL has L in position 5 (✓) and position 4 is L which would be (-), matching our feedback.\n\nThus, SPALL is the most plausible next guess.\n\n<guess>SPALL</guess>Based on the feedback so far, we have:\n- S correctly placed in position 1\n- A correctly placed in position 3\n- L is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4\n- Therefore L must be in position 5\n- The remaining letters to test for positions 2 and 4 are from the unused pool excluding R,O,E,N,T,C,D\n\nThe only common 5-letter word fitting S _ A _ L with these constraints is SPALL.\n\n<guess>SPALL</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: SCALD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) L(-) D(x)\nGuess 4: SPALL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the four rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From the five rounds of feedback we now know:

- Positions 1-3 are locked: S P A
- Position 5 is locked: L
- Position 4 is unknown, but:
  – S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from SPASM feedback: S(-) in position 4)
  – M is NOT in the word (from SPASM feedback: M(x))
  – All previously excluded letters remain excluded: R, O, E, N, T, C, D

So the word must be S P A _ L with the blank filled by a letter that:
  – Has not been excluded
  – Has not already been placed (S, P, A, L are all used once)

Remaining candidate letters for position 4: B, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit S P A _ L:
- SPALL – already guessed and rejected (L would have to be in position 4, which is disallowed)
- SPASM – already guessed and rejected (S in position 4 is disallowed)
- SPAWL – not a valid word
- SPAIL – not a valid word
- SPAKL – not a valid word
- SPAGL – not a valid word
- SPAIL – not valid
- SPAUL – not a valid word
- SPAWL – not valid
- SPAIL – not valid
- SPAIL – not valid

The only remaining plausible word is SPAWL, but that is not in standard dictionaries. Rechecking the list of remaining letters and valid word possibilities, the only common English word that fits S P A _ L is:

SPALL – already ruled out
SPASM – already ruled out

This suggests the intended word must be SPAWL, despite it being uncommon. However, upon closer inspection, ""spawl"" is indeed listed in some dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal form of ""spew"" or ""spurt,"" but it is not standard.

Re-evaluating the constraints more carefully:
- The only letters left that can fill position 4 are those not yet excluded and not already used.
- From the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y
- The only valid English word among these is SPAWL, but since that is not standard, we must have missed something.

Wait – let's re-examine the feedback for SPALL:
SPALL feedback: S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓)
This means:
- The first three letters are correct: S P A
- The fourth letter is L but it is in the wrong position (L(-) at position 4)
- The fifth letter is L and it is correct (L(✓) at position 5)

This implies the word has two L's, one in position 5 and one L elsewhere (but not in position 4).

Thus the word must be S P A _ L with an additional L somewhere, but position 4 cannot be L (as it was marked (-) there), and position 5 is already L. This is impossible unless the word has two L's, which would require the fourth letter to be L, but that was rejected.

This suggests the only possible word is S P A L L, but as noted, the feedback for SPALL indicates L is not in position 4, and L is in position 5, making S P A L L impossible because it would have L in both 4 and 5, but position 5 is already confirmed as L.

This indicates the word must be S P A L L, despite the apparent contradiction, because the feedback for SPALL was interpreted incorrectly. The feedback shows:
- S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: S ✓
- Position 2: P ✓
- Position 3: A ✓
- Position 4: L (-) – L is in the word but not in position 4
- Position 5: L (✓) – L is in position 5

Thus the word has L in position 5 and another L elsewhere (but not in position 4). The only possible placement is S P A L L, with L in position 5 and the other L in position 4, but position 4 was marked (-) for L, meaning L is not in position 4. This is a contradiction unless the word is S P A L L.

However, the feedback for SPALL cannot be S P A L L because the fourth letter would be L, which was marked (-). This suggests the intended word must be S P A L L, but the feedback provided seems to conflict.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback for SPALL is listed as:
S(✓) P(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓)

This indicates the word is S P A L L, with L in position 5 and the other L in position 4, but position 4 was marked (-) for L, meaning L is not in position 4. This is impossible unless the feedback was intended differently.

This suggests the only possible word left is S P A L L, despite the apparent contradiction, as all other possibilities have been exhausted.

Therefore, the correct next guess is:

<guess>SPALL</guess>
</think>

The feedback from SPALL shows:
- S P A are locked in positions 1-3
- L is locked in position 5
- Position 4 must be an L (since the only remaining letter that satisfies all constraints is L), despite the (-) on L at position 4. This indicates the word must contain two L's, one in position 4 and one in position 5, but position 5 was marked as ✓ for L, making this impossible.

Re-evaluating, the only remaining valid word fitting S P A _ L is actually **SPALL** itself, suggesting the feedback may have been intended to confirm L in position 5 and leave position 4 open. Given the constraints, the only possible word is:
