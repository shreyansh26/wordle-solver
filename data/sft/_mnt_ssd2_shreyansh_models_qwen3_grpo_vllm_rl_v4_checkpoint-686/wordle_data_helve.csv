For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good range of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me think of words ending in E that avoid those letters:
- TUBED (but has D, which is okay, but B is okay)
- PINE? No, has I and N, but P, I, N, E are okay, but we already know E is last so PINE would be 4 letters.
- ""UNTIE"" - but has U, N, T, I, E. This seems good - uses U, N, T, I, E. None of these letters were ruled out except E was confirmed correct position.

Wait, let me check:
- U, N, T, I, E - none of these are in the forbidden set (A, R, O, S). E is confirmed in last spot. This seems like a strong second guess to test new letters.

Another option: ""MUTED"" - but D wasn't tested yet, but M, U, T, E, D - all allowed.
""UNTIE"" seems slightly better as it tests more new vowels/consonants.

So I'll go with UNITE (though it's spelled UNITE, not UNTIE - correction: the word is ""UNTIE"").

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me think of words ending in E that avoid those letters:
- TUBED (but has D, which is okay, but B is okay)
- PINE? No, has I and N, but P, I, N, E are okay, but we already know E is last so PINE would be 4 letters.
- ""UNTIE"" - but has U, N, T, I, E. This seems good - uses U, N, T, I, E. None of these letters were ruled out except E was confirmed correct position.

Wait, let me check:
- U, N, T, I, E - none of these are in the forbidden set (A, R, O, S). E is confirmed in last spot. This seems like a strong second guess to test new letters.

Another option: ""MUTED"" - but D wasn't tested yet, but M, U, T, E, D - all allowed.
""UNTIE"" seems slightly better as it tests more new vowels/consonants.

So I'll go with UNITE (though it's spelled UNITE, not UNTIE - correction: the word is ""UNTIE"").

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
   - E is again confirmed in position 5.
   - U, N, T, I are now also ruled out.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: only Y can act as vowel here (E is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, using none of the forbidden letters, and testing new ones.

Possible candidates:
- ""DWELL"" – but L is repeated and we don’t know about L yet.
- ""FLECK"" – ends in K, not E.
- ""BLECH"" – ends in H.
- ""GUESS"" – contains S, which is forbidden.
- ""MUCKE"" – not a valid English word.
- ""PENCE"" – contains N, which is forbidden.
- ""WEDGE"" – W, E, D, G, E – uses W, D, G and E twice. All letters are allowed so far.

""WEDGE"" seems valid:
- Letters: W, E, D, G, E.
- E is in position 5 (matches).
- W, D, G are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I) are used.

Another option is ""CHEEK"" but C, H, K are new, but it has double E which might not give us new info.

- Contains H somewhere other than position 2.  
- Contains no forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, W, D, G, C, K).  

Remaining consonants to try: L, M, P, B, F, V, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only Y can act as a vowel here (E is already used).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a good range of common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me think of words ending in E that avoid those letters:
- TUBED (but has D, which is okay, but B is okay)
- PINE? No, has I and N, but P, I, N, E are okay, but we already know E is last so PINE would be 4 letters.
- ""UNTIE"" - but has U, N, T, I, E. This seems good - uses U, N, T, I, E. None of these letters were ruled out except E was confirmed correct position.

Wait, let me check:
- U, N, T, I, E - none of these are in the forbidden set (A, R, O, S). E is confirmed in last spot. This seems like a strong second guess to test new letters.

Another option: ""MUTED"" - but D wasn't tested yet, but M, U, T, E, D - all allowed.
""UNTIE"" seems slightly better as it tests more new vowels/consonants.

So I'll go with UNITE (though it's spelled UNITE, not UNTIE - correction: the word is ""UNTIE"").

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are completely absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)
   - E is again confirmed in position 5.
   - U, N, T, I are now also ruled out.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: only Y can act as vowel here (E is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, using none of the forbidden letters, and testing new ones.

Possible candidates:
- ""DWELL"" – but L is repeated and we don’t know about L yet.
- ""FLECK"" – ends in K, not E.
- ""BLECH"" – ends in H.
- ""GUESS"" – contains S, which is forbidden.
- ""MUCKE"" – not a valid English word.
- ""PENCE"" – contains N, which is forbidden.
- ""WEDGE"" – W, E, D, G, E – uses W, D, G and E twice. All letters are allowed so far.

""WEDGE"" seems valid:
- Letters: W, E, D, G, E.
- E is in position 5 (matches).
- W, D, G are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I) are used.

Another option is ""CHEEK"" but C, H, K are new, but it has double E which might not give us new info.
""WEDGE"" tests three new consonants (W, D, G) and confirms E is last.

I'll go with WEDGE.

- ""MUCKE"" – not valid.
- ""PENCE"" – N is forbidden.
- ""YACKE"" – Y, A, C, K, E – but A is forbidden.
- ""FUMED"" – U, M, E, D – U and D are forbidden.
- ""CHEEK"" – C, H, E, E, K – uses C, H, K and E twice. All letters are allowed so far.

""CHEEK"" seems valid:
- Letters: C, H, E, E, K.
- E is in position 5 (matches).
- C, H, K are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters are used.

Another option is ""MUCKE"" but it's not a valid word. ""FLECK"" doesn't end in E. ""BLECH"" ends in H. So ""CHEEK"" is the best valid option here.

- HEDGE – D forbidden.  
- HEFLE – not valid.  
- HELVE – L in position 3, V in position 4: ""HELVE"" – yes!  

""HELVE"" is a valid word meaning the ridge or ridge-like structure on a boat or ship.  

Letters: H, E, L, V, E.  
- H in position 1 (correct).  
- E in position 2 (but we have E in position 5).  

Wait, no: ""HELVE"" is H E L V E, which would have E in position 2 and 5. But our pattern is H _ L _ E, so position 2 can be any letter, position 4 must be a consonant.  

""HELVE"" fits: H E L V E.  
- H is correct in position 1.  
- E is in position 2 (no restriction).  
- L is correct in position 3.  
- V is in position 4.  
- E is correct in position 5.  

And all letters are allowed: H, E, L, V, E.  

No forbidden letters are used.  

Thus, ""HELVE"" is the correct word.

""HELVE"" is a valid word meaning the ridge or ridge-like structure on a boat or ship.  

Letters: H, E, L, V, E.  
- H in position 1 (correct).  
- E in position 2 (but we have E in position 5).  

Wait, no: ""HELVE"" is H E L V E, which would have E in position 2 and 5. But our pattern is H _ L _ E, so position 2 can be any letter, position 4 must be a consonant.  

""HELVE"" fits: H E L V E.  
- H is correct in position 1.  
- E is in position 2 (no restriction).  
- L is correct in position 3.  
- V is in position 4.  
- E is correct in position 5.  

And all letters are allowed: H, E, L, V, E.  

No forbidden letters are used.  

Thus, ""HELVE"" is the correct word.Based on the feedback, the pattern is now:
H _ L _ E

The only valid word fitting this pattern with the allowed letters is ""HELVE"".",Guess 6: HELVE -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) L(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
