For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.

Possible words could be:
- RASPY (but has P, Y which are untested)
- STARS (but has E in it)
- RASPY seems okay, but let's think of better options.

Another good candidate is ""RASPY"" but let's see if we can find one with more common letters.

Actually, ""STARS"" has E in it (no, it doesn't), but ""STRAY"" has E. ""STARK"" has E. ""STARS"" is fine (no E or O).

But ""STARS"" has S in position 1 (allowed), T (new letter), A in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word at all.

2. STARS → S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
   - First S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - The last S is in position 5 and is correct.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- The letters A, R, S are all in the word (and S is fixed in position 5).
- The letters O, E, T are not in the word.
- Positions ruled out:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
  - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (but is fixed in 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A and R exactly once each (since S is already used in position 5), and does not contain O, E, T.

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is S, so 2 or 4.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. 5 is S, so 1 or 3.

Let's list possible patterns:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ S
- If A is in position 4: _ _ A _ S

For each pattern, R must fit in 1 or 3 (if A is in 2) or 1, 2, 3 (if A is in 4).

Also, we need to avoid positions already ruled out.

Let's try A in position 2:
Pattern: _ A _ _ S
R must be in position 1 or 3.
- R in 1: R A _ _ S
  - Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 that are not O, E, T, and not A or R or S.
  - Possible letters: common ones like N, D, L, C, etc.
  - R A N C S - but C is not ruled out.
  - R A N D S - RANDS is a word (short for randy or slang).
  - R A N G S - RANGES is 6 letters.
  - R A I N S - RAINS is a word (but has I which is untested).
  - R A D S - too short.
  - R A N S - 4 letters.
  - R A I S - 4 letters.
  - R A N C S - not valid.
  - R A N D S - valid.

Let's check RAINS: R A I N S - this is a valid 5-letter word, uses A in 2, R in 1, S in 5, and I and N are new letters not ruled out.
- RAINS: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
This would test I and N as new letters.

Another option: R A D S - but that's 4 letters.
R A N D S - valid word.

  - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (but is fixed in 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A and R exactly once each (since S is already used in position 5), and does not contain O, E, T.

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is S, so 2 or 4.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. 5 is S, so 1 or 3.

Let's list possible patterns:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ S
- If A is in position 4: _ _ A _ S

For each pattern, R must fit in 1 or 3 (if A is in 2) or 1, 2, 3 (if A is in 4).

Also, we need to avoid positions already ruled out.

Let's try A in position 2:
Pattern: _ A _ _ S
R must be in position 1 or 3.
- R in 1: R A _ _ S
  - Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 that are not O, E, T, and not A or R or S.
  - Possible letters: common ones like N, D, L, C, etc.
  - R A N C S - but C is not ruled out.
  - R A N D S - RANDS is a word (short for randy or slang).
  - R A N G S - RANGES is 6 letters.
  - R A I N S - RAINS is a word (but has I which is untested).
  - R A D S - too short.
  - R A N S - 4 letters.
  - R A I S - 4 letters.
  - R A N C S - not valid.
  - R A N D S - valid.

Let's check RAINS: R A I N S - this is a valid 5-letter word, uses A in 2, R in 1, S in 5, and I and N are new letters not ruled out.
- RAINS: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
This would test I and N as new letters.

Another option: R A D S - but that's 4 letters.
R A N D S - valid word.

Between RAINS and RANDS, RAINS seems more common.

Let's go with RAINS as the next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E
- Positions ruled out: A not in 1, R not in 2, S not in 4.

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, S (each at least once) and does not contain O or E, and places A, R, S in new positions.

Possible words could be:
- RASPY (but has P, Y which are untested)
- STARS (but has E in it)
- RASPY seems okay, but let's think of better options.

Another good candidate is ""RASPY"" but let's see if we can find one with more common letters.

Actually, ""STARS"" has E in it (no, it doesn't), but ""STRAY"" has E. ""STARK"" has E. ""STARS"" is fine (no E or O).

But ""STARS"" has S in position 1 (allowed), T (new letter), A in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).

This seems like a good second guess to test T and the placement of A, R, S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word at all.

2. STARS → S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
   - First S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - The last S is in position 5 and is correct.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- The letters A, R, S are all in the word (and S is fixed in position 5).
- The letters O, E, T are not in the word.
- Positions ruled out:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
  - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (but is fixed in 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A and R exactly once each (since S is already used in position 5), and does not contain O, E, T.

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is S, so 2 or 4.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. 5 is S, so 1 or 3.

Let's list possible patterns:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ S
- If A is in position 4: _ _ A _ S

For each pattern, R must fit in 1 or 3 (if A is in 2) or 1, 2, 3 (if A is in 4).

Also, we need to avoid positions already ruled out.

Let's try A in position 2:
Pattern: _ A _ _ S
R must be in position 1 or 3.
- R in 1: R A _ _ S
  - Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 that are not O, E, T, and not A or R or S.
  - Possible letters: common ones like N, D, L, C, etc.
  - R A N C S - but C is not ruled out.
  - R A N D S - RANDS is a word (short for randy or slang).
  - R A N G S - RANGES is 6 letters.
  - R A I N S - RAINS is a word (but has I which is untested).
  - R A D S - too short.
  - R A N S - 4 letters.
  - R A I S - 4 letters.
  - R A N C S - not valid.
  - R A N D S - valid.

Let's check RAINS: R A I N S - this is a valid 5-letter word, uses A in 2, R in 1, S in 5, and I and N are new letters not ruled out.
- RAINS: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
This would test I and N as new letters.

Another option: R A D S - but that's 4 letters.
R A N D S - valid word.

Between RAINS and RANDS, RAINS seems more common.

Let's go with RAINS as the next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: RAINS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
2. STARS → S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
3. RAINS → R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)

What we know for certain:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- R is in position 1.
- A is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Letters not in the word at all: O, E, T, I, N.

So the pattern so far is: R A _ _ S

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not O, E, T, I, N, A, R, S). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of valid 5-letter words that fit R A _ _ S:
- R A B E S → but E is ruled out.
- R A C E S → E is ruled out.
- R A D A S → A is already used in position 2.
- R A D S _ → need 5 letters.
- R A D A S → 4 letters.
- R A D G S → not a word.
- R A D I S → I is ruled out.
- R A D O S → O is ruled out.
- R A D Y S → not a word.
- R A F T S → T is ruled out.
- R A G E S → E is ruled out.
- R A G U S → not common.
- R A H O S → O is ruled out.
- R A L A S → not a word.
- R A L I S → I is ruled out.

- R A Z E S → E is ruled out.
- R A Z I S → I is ruled out.
- R A Z U S → not a word.
- R A Z Y S → not a word.

Hmm, let's try common consonants for positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at R A _ _ S, possible combinations:
- R A C K S → but K is not ruled out.
- R A C K S → valid word, uses C and K.
- R A C E S → E is out.
- R A C H S → not a word.
- R A C U S → not a word.

- R A Y U S → not a word.
- R A Y V S → not a word.
- R A Y W S → not a word.
- R A Z U S → not a word.
- R A Z Y S → not a word.

Wait, let's think of other possibilities. The letters for positions 3 and 4 could be any remaining letters, including vowels like U, Y (sometimes vowel), etc.

Looking at R A U _ S:
- R A U F S → not a word.
- R A U G S → not a word.
- R A U L S → not a word.
- R A U M S → not a word.
- R A U N S → N is out.

From all feedback so far we have:

Pattern locked in: R A _ _ S
Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed: R, A, S.

Letters that have been ruled out completely:  
O, E, T, I, N, C, K.

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not in {O, E, T, I, N, C, K}.  
Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help eliminate many possibilities early on.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, E
- Positions ruled out: A not in 1, R not in 2, S not in 4.

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, S (each at least once) and does not contain O or E, and places A, R, S in new positions.

Possible words could be:
- RASPY (but has P, Y which are untested)
- STARS (but has E in it)
- RASPY seems okay, but let's think of better options.

Another good candidate is ""RASPY"" but let's see if we can find one with more common letters.

Actually, ""STARS"" has E in it (no, it doesn't), but ""STRAY"" has E. ""STARK"" has E. ""STARS"" is fine (no E or O).

But ""STARS"" has S in position 1 (allowed), T (new letter), A in position 3 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed), S in position 5 (allowed).

This seems like a good second guess to test T and the placement of A, R, S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word at all.

2. STARS → S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
   - First S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.
   - The last S is in position 5 and is correct.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- The letters A, R, S are all in the word (and S is fixed in position 5).
- The letters O, E, T are not in the word.
- Positions ruled out:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
  - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (but is fixed in 5).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A and R exactly once each (since S is already used in position 5), and does not contain O, E, T.

Possible positions for A and R:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But 5 is S, so 2 or 4.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. 5 is S, so 1 or 3.

Let's list possible patterns:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ S
- If A is in position 4: _ _ A _ S

For each pattern, R must fit in 1 or 3 (if A is in 2) or 1, 2, 3 (if A is in 4).

Also, we need to avoid positions already ruled out.

Let's try A in position 2:
Pattern: _ A _ _ S
R must be in position 1 or 3.
- R in 1: R A _ _ S
  - Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 that are not O, E, T, and not A or R or S.
  - Possible letters: common ones like N, D, L, C, etc.
  - R A N C S - but C is not ruled out.
  - R A N D S - RANDS is a word (short for randy or slang).
  - R A N G S - RANGES is 6 letters.
  - R A I N S - RAINS is a word (but has I which is untested).
  - R A D S - too short.
  - R A N S - 4 letters.
  - R A I S - 4 letters.
  - R A N C S - not valid.
  - R A N D S - valid.

Let's check RAINS: R A I N S - this is a valid 5-letter word, uses A in 2, R in 1, S in 5, and I and N are new letters not ruled out.
- RAINS: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
This would test I and N as new letters.

Another option: R A D S - but that's 4 letters.
R A N D S - valid word.

Between RAINS and RANDS, RAINS seems more common.

Let's go with RAINS as the next guess.

Guess 3: RAINS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
2. STARS → S(-) T(x) A(-) R(-) S(✓)
3. RAINS → R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x) S(✓)

What we know for certain:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- R is in position 1.
- A is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Letters not in the word at all: O, E, T, I, N.

So the pattern so far is: R A _ _ S

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from letters that have not been ruled out (i.e., not O, E, T, I, N, A, R, S). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Hmm, let's try common consonants for positions 3 and 4. The remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at R A _ _ S, possible combinations:
- R A C K S → but K is not ruled out.

The only valid word I can see that fits is R A C K S, which uses C and K (both untested and not ruled out).

<guess>RACKS</guess>Based on the feedback, we now know:
- R is in position 1.
- A is in position 2.
- S is in position 5.
- Letters not in the word: O, E, T, I, N.
- We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining pool.

The only common 5-letter word that fits the pattern R A _ _ S with these constraints is RACKS.

From all feedback so far we have:

Pattern locked in: R A _ _ S
Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed: R, A, S.

Letters that have been ruled out completely:  
O, E, T, I, N, C, K.

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not in {O, E, T, I, N, C, K}.  
Available letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter English word of the form R A _ _ S.  
Scanning possibilities:

- R A B _ S → RABBS (not a word), RABDS (invalid), RABFS (invalid), etc.  
- R A D _ S → RADDY (invalid), RADIS (I is out), RADGS (invalid)…  
- R A F _ S → RAFDS (invalid), RAFFS (valid, but F is repeated)  
- R A G _ S → RAGGS (valid, uses G twice)  
- R A H _ S → RAHMS (invalid), RAHDS (invalid)…  
- R A L _ S → RALMS (invalid), RALYS (invalid)…  
- R A M _ S → RAMPS (P is allowed, M is allowed)  
- R A P _ S → RAPHS (invalid), RAPDS (invalid)…  
- R A U _ S → RAUFS (invalid), RAUGS (invalid)…  
- R A V _ S → RAVMS (invalid), RAVDS (invalid)…  
- R A W _ S → RAWMS (invalid), RAWDS (invalid)…  
- R A Y _ S → RAYMS (invalid), RAYDS (invalid)…  
- R A G _ S → RAGGS (valid)  
- R A M _ S → RAMPS (valid)  

Between RAGGS and RAMPS, both fit. RAMPS uses M and P (both still allowed), while RAGGS uses G twice. I’ll choose RAMPS.

The only remaining plausible word that fits R A _ _ S and uses allowed letters is R A G U S, but that’s not a valid word.  
Rechecking, the only valid English word left is R A G G S (but G repeats).  
However, we have not eliminated double letters yet.  
R A G G S is a valid word (though uncommon, it’s listed in dictionaries as plural of “rag”).  
Given no other valid options, RAGGS is the only possible word left.

But wait—let’s double-check:  
- R A B B S → invalid.  
- R A D D S → invalid.  
- R A F F S → invalid.  
- R A G G S → valid (though rare).  
- R A H H S → invalid.  
- R A L L S → invalid.  
- R A V V S → invalid.  
- R A W W S → invalid.  
- R A Y Y S → invalid.  

Thus, the only valid word left is RAGGS.

However, in standard word lists, RAGGS is not typically accepted.  
Re-examining: are there any other valid 5-letter words of the form R A _ _ S with the remaining letters?  
- R A B U S → not valid.  
- R A D U S → not valid.  
- R A F U S → not valid.  
- R A H U S → not valid.  
- R A L U S → not valid.  
- R A V U S → not valid.  
- R A W U S → not valid.  
- R A Y U S → not valid.  

It appears RAGGS is the only possible word left, despite its rarity.  
Therefore, I will guess RAGGS.

But let me verify once more with more common words:  
- R A B E S → E is out.  
- R A B O S → O is out.  
- R A C E S → C is out.  
- R A D E S → E is out.

Therefore, I will make that guess.

<guess>RAGGS</guess>",RAGGS,"Current locked-in pattern: R A _ _ S  
Positions 1, 2, and 5 are fixed: R, A, S.

Letters already eliminated (must not appear anywhere):  
O, E, T, I, N, C, K, M, P.

So positions 3 and 4 must be filled from the remaining alphabet, excluding the above.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, Q, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels still allowed: U (Y can act as a vowel).

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form R A _ _ S.
