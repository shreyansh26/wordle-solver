For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with O in the middle position.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere except the 4th position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Good next consonants to test are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since S must appear, let’s try a word that places S in a new position and introduces new common letters. A strong candidate is “POINT”:

- P: new letter
- O: already confirmed in 3rd spot
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- Also moves S out of 4th position (it’s not in POINT anyway).

But wait, we know S is in the word, so POINT would miss that. Let me pick a word that includes S in a different spot and covers new letters. “STONY” would place S in 1st position, but we don’t know about T, N, Y yet. 

Another option is “SOUND”:
- S in 1st position (new spot)
- O confirmed in 3rd
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- D: new consonant

This seems optimal as it tests S in a new spot and introduces several new letters.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now confirmed in the 1st position (✓).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (this contradicts the first feedback where O was marked as ✓ in the 3rd position).  
     However, the only way both can be true is if the feedback for SOUND was mis-typed. The symbol ""-"" means ""in word but wrong position,"" so O being ""-"" in SOUND implies O is NOT in the 3rd position, which conflicts with the first feedback. This must be an error in the feedback provided.

Assuming the feedback for SOUND is correct (S is 1st letter, O is in word but not 3rd), we must reinterpret the first feedback. The only consistent way is that the first feedback's ""O(✓)"" was actually indicating O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (because in SOUND the O is in 2nd position and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not 2nd). This suggests the feedback might have been mis-recorded.

Re-reading carefully:
- In AROSE, O was marked as ✓, which means it's in the word AND in the correct position (3rd).
- In SOUND, O was marked as -, meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd position (which is consistent with it being in 3rd).

So the confirmed facts are:
- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, U
- Letters still to test: common consonants like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st) confirmed
- P: new consonant
- O (3rd) confirmed
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant

This tests P, I, L and fits the pattern S _ O _ _.

- In AROSE, O was marked as ✓, which means it's in the word AND in the correct position (3rd).
- In SOUND, O was marked as -, meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd position (which is consistent with it being in 3rd).

So the confirmed facts are:
- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, U
- Letters still to test: common consonants like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st) confirmed
- P: new consonant
- O (3rd) confirmed
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant

This tests P, I, L and fits the pattern S _ O _ _.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with O in the middle position.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _\n- It contains S somewhere except the 4th position.\n- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n\nGood next consonants to test are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since S must appear, let’s try a word that places S in a new position and introduces new common letters.

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the 1st position.
   - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (consistent with it being in 3rd).
   - U is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

3. SPOIL → S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
   - S is in the 1st position (confirmed).
   - O is in the 3rd position (confirmed).
   - P is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - I and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters in the word: S, O, P, U
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L
- Positions to fill: 2nd and 4th letters.

We have P and U still to place. P is not in 2nd position, U is not in 3rd position (already 3rd is O), so U could be in 4th position, and P could be in 2nd or 4th, but 4th could take U or P. Let's try:

Possible placements:
- 2nd: P or U
- 4th: P or U

But P is not in 2nd, so P must be in 4th, leaving U for 2nd. This gives S U O P _ but we need 5 letters. Wait, pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S _ O _ _

If P is in 4th: S _ O P _
If U is in 2nd: S U O P _

But we need a 5th letter. We have letters left: common consonants like T, C, M, etc. Since we have S, O, P, U, the 5th letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet ruled out. Let's think of words fitting S _ O P _ with remaining letters.

But we also have U to place. Let's try:

S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, we have S, U, O, P, so the 5th letter must be one of these. Wait, no - the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter.

Wait, the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet. From remaining common letters, let's think of words:

S _ O _ _ with letters S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT
- S P O U T
- Check positions: S(1) ✓, P(2) but P is not in 2nd position (from SPOIL feedback P is in word but not 2nd). So P cannot be 2nd. Thus SPOUT is invalid.

Next possibility: S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter. Let's think of ""SOUTH"":
- S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this would be SOUT_, not matching pattern.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid (P not in 2nd).

S U O P T - but P is 4th, which is allowed (P is in word but not 2nd), and U is 2nd. This gives S U O P T - but this is 5 letters: S, U, O, P, T. This seems valid.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Another option: S P O U T - invalid for P position.

S U O P T seems to fit:
- S(1) ✓
- U(2) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 2nd)
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

But we have S, U, O, P, T - this seems valid.

But let's think of more common words. Another possibility: S P O U N - but N is out.

S P O U L - L is out.

S C O P U - but C hasn't been tested, and positions: S C O P U - P is 4th (allowed), U is 5th (allowed), C is new.

But is SCOPU a word? Doesn't seem common.

S U O P T - not a common word.

Another approach: since we have S, O, P, U, and need one more letter, let's try common consonants like C, M, T.

Looking for S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT - P is 2nd (invalid).

SOUTH - S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this is SOUT_, not matching.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this would be S T O P U, but pattern is S _ O _ _, so 2nd is T, 4th is P, 5th is U.

This gives S T O P U - check:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- U(5) - allowed

This seems valid and common: SToup? Actually, STOUP is archaic, but STOUP is not common.

SPOUT is invalid for P position.

Another option: S U O T P - but T is 4th, P is 5th.

But S U O T P - not a word.

S T O P U - seems like the closest valid option.

But let's think of ""SOUTH"" again - S O U T H - positions: S(1), O(3), U(4), T(5), H(2). But this would be S H O U T - but O is 3rd, so S H O U T - this is SHOUT.

Check SHOUT:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

This seems valid and common.

But we have letters in word: S, O, P, U, T, H - but we only have 5 letters, so must be S, O, P, U, T or S, O, U, T plus one more.

Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter, or S, O, P, U plus one more.

Looking at SHOUT: S, H, O, U, T - this contains S, O, U, T, but not P. So missing P.

Thus must include P.

Thus the word must be S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

S T O P U - as before.

S C O P U - SCOPU - not common.

S M O K U - no.

Another approach: list 5-letter words starting with S, O in 3rd, containing P and U.

Possible: S P O U T - invalid P position.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - not common.

S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S O P T U - O is 2nd, but O must be 3rd.

Thus seems the only possible is S U O P T - but this is not a word.

Wait, let's think differently: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid.

Thus must be S _ O _ _ with P in 4th or 5th, U in 2nd or 5th.

But pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th or 5th] [remaining]

We have P and U to place.

If P is 4th: S [2nd] O P [5th], then 2nd and 5th must be U and one more.

But 2nd can't be P (already 4th), and must be U or new letter.

But we have S, O, P, U, and one more.

Thus possible: S U O P [new], but need 5th letter.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this is STOUP, which is archaic.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

S M O K U - no.

S W O P U - SWOPU - no.

S H O P U - SHOPU - no.

S L O P U - L is out.

S V O P U - no.

Thus seems the only possible is S T O P U (STOUP), but it's archaic.

Alternative: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which contradicts feedback.

Thus must be S U O P T - but not a word.

Wait, let's re-examine feedback:

From SPOIL:
- S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)

P(-) means P is in word but not 2nd position.

Thus P can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th, but O is 3rd, so P must be 4th or 5th.

Similarly, U(-) from SOUND means U is in word but not 3rd position. Since O is 3rd, U can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Thus possible placements:

Case 1: P is 4th
   S _ O P _
   Then U must be 2nd or 5th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O P _ - need 5th letter. Letters used: S, U, O, P. Need one more. Common consonants: T, C, M, etc. S U O P T - not a word.
   - If U is 5th: S _ O P U - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

Case 2: P is 5th
   S _ O _ P
   Then U must be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But O is 3rd, so U is 2nd or 4th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O _ P - 4th letter must be new consonant. S U O T P - not a word.
   - If U is 4th: S _ O U P - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S T O U P - this is SToup, archaic, but ""stoup"" is a word (a basin for holy water).

Thus the most plausible word is STOUP.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Thus guess: STOUP
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is fixed in 1st position.
- O is fixed in 3rd position.
- P is in the word but not 2nd position.
- U is in the word but not 3rd position (already O).
- Letters not in word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L.

The only remaining placement for P and U is:
- P must be 4th or 5th.
- U must be 2nd or 4th (if P is 5th).

This leads to the word ""STOUP"" (S T O U P), where:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- P(5) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 5th)

- Positions to fill: 2nd and 4th letters.

We have P and U still to place. P is not in 2nd position, U is not in 3rd position (already 3rd is O), so U could be in 4th position, and P could be in 2nd or 4th, but 4th could take U or P. Let's try:

Possible placements:
- 2nd: P or U
- 4th: P or U

But P is not in 2nd, so P must be in 4th, leaving U for 2nd. This gives S U O P _ but we need 5 letters. Wait, pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S _ O _ _

If P is in 4th: S _ O P _
If U is in 2nd: S U O P _

But we need a 5th letter. We have letters left: common consonants like T, C, M, etc. Since we have S, O, P, U, the 5th letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet ruled out. Let's think of words fitting S _ O P _ with remaining letters.

But we also have U to place. Let's try:

S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, we have S, U, O, P, so the 5th letter must be one of these. Wait, no - the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter.

Wait, the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet. From remaining common letters, let's think of words:

S _ O _ _ with letters S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT
- S P O U T
- Check positions: S(1) ✓, P(2) but P is not in 2nd position (from SPOIL feedback P is in word but not 2nd). So P cannot be 2nd. Thus SPOUT is invalid.

Next possibility: S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter. Let's think of ""SOUTH"":
- S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this would be SOUT_, not matching pattern.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

Let's try:
S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid (P not in 2nd).

S U O P T - but P is 4th, which is allowed (P is in word but not 2nd), and U is 2nd. This gives S U O P T - but this is 5 letters: S, U, O, P, T. This seems valid.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Another option: S P O U T - invalid for P position.

S U O P T seems to fit:
- S(1) ✓

S P O U L - L is out.

S C O P U - but C hasn't been tested, and positions: S C O P U - P is 4th (allowed), U is 5th (allowed), C is new.

But is SCOPU a word? Doesn't seem common.

S U O P T - not a common word.

Another approach: since we have S, O, P, U, and need one more letter, let's try common consonants like C, M, T.

Looking for S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT - P is 2nd (invalid).

SOUTH - S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this is SOUT_, not matching.

SPOUT is invalid for P position.

Another option: S U O T P - but T is 4th, P is 5th.

But S U O T P - not a word.

S T O P U - seems like the closest valid option.

But let's think of ""SOUTH"" again - S O U T H - positions: S(1), O(3), U(4), T(5), H(2). But this would be S H O U T - but O is 3rd, so S H O U T - this is SHOUT.

Check SHOUT:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

This seems valid and common.

But we have letters in word: S, O, P, U, T, H - but we only have 5 letters, so must be S, O, P, U, T or S, O, U, T plus one more.

Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter, or S, O, P, U plus one more.

Looking at SHOUT: S, H, O, U, T - this contains S, O, U, T, but not P. So missing P.

S U O P T - as before.

S T O P U - as before.

But pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th or 5th] [remaining]

We have P and U to place.

If P is 4th: S [2nd] O P [5th], then 2nd and 5th must be U and one more.

But 2nd can't be P (already 4th), and must be U or new letter.

But we have S, O, P, U, and one more.

Thus possible: S U O P [new], but need 5th letter.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this is STOUP, which is archaic.

Thus must be S U O P T - but not a word.

Wait, let's re-examine feedback:

From SPOIL:
- S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)

P(-) means P is in word but not 2nd position.

Thus P can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th, but O is 3rd, so P must be 4th or 5th.

Similarly, U(-) from SOUND means U is in word but not 3rd position. Since O is 3rd, U can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Thus possible placements:

Case 1: P is 4th
   S _ O P _
   Then U must be 2nd or 5th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O P _ - need 5th letter. Letters used: S, U, O, P. Need one more. Common consonants: T, C, M, etc. S U O P T - not a word.
   - If U is 5th: S _ O P U - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

Case 2: P is 5th
   S _ O _ P
   Then U must be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But O is 3rd, so U is 2nd or 4th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O _ P - 4th letter must be new consonant. S U O T P - not a word.
   - If U is 4th: S _ O U P - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S T O U P - this is SToup, archaic, but ""stoup"" is a word (a basin for holy water).

Thus the most plausible word is STOUP.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Thus guess: STOUPBased on the feedback:
- S is fixed in 1st position.
- O is fixed in 3rd position.
- P is in the word but not 2nd position.
- U is in the word but not 3rd position (already O).
- Letters not in word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L.

The only remaining placement for P and U is:
- P must be 4th or 5th.
- U must be 2nd or 4th (if P is 5th).

This leads to the word ""STOUP"" (S T O U P), where:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- P(5) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 5th)",Guess 4: STOUP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) U(✓) P(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with O in the middle position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere except the 4th position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Good next consonants to test are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since S must appear, let’s try a word that places S in a new position and introduces new common letters. A strong candidate is “POINT”:

- P: new letter
- O: already confirmed in 3rd spot
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- Also moves S out of 4th position (it’s not in POINT anyway).

But wait, we know S is in the word, so POINT would miss that. Let me pick a word that includes S in a different spot and covers new letters. “STONY” would place S in 1st position, but we don’t know about T, N, Y yet. 

Another option is “SOUND”:
- S in 1st position (new spot)
- O confirmed in 3rd
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- D: new consonant

This seems optimal as it tests S in a new spot and introduces several new letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now confirmed in the 1st position (✓).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (this contradicts the first feedback where O was marked as ✓ in the 3rd position).  
     However, the only way both can be true is if the feedback for SOUND was mis-typed. The symbol ""-"" means ""in word but wrong position,"" so O being ""-"" in SOUND implies O is NOT in the 3rd position, which conflicts with the first feedback. This must be an error in the feedback provided.

Assuming the feedback for SOUND is correct (S is 1st letter, O is in word but not 3rd), we must reinterpret the first feedback. The only consistent way is that the first feedback's ""O(✓)"" was actually indicating O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (because in SOUND the O is in 2nd position and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not 2nd). This suggests the feedback might have been mis-recorded.

Re-reading carefully:
- In AROSE, O was marked as ✓, which means it's in the word AND in the correct position (3rd).
- In SOUND, O was marked as -, meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd position (which is consistent with it being in 3rd).

So the confirmed facts are:
- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, U
- Letters still to test: common consonants like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st) confirmed
- P: new consonant
- O (3rd) confirmed
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant

This tests P, I, L and fits the pattern S _ O _ _.

Guess 3: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the 1st position.
   - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (consistent with it being in 3rd).
   - U is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

3. SPOIL → S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
   - S is in the 1st position (confirmed).
   - O is in the 3rd position (confirmed).
   - P is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - I and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters in the word: S, O, P, U
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L
- Positions to fill: 2nd and 4th letters.

We have P and U still to place. P is not in 2nd position, U is not in 3rd position (already 3rd is O), so U could be in 4th position, and P could be in 2nd or 4th, but 4th could take U or P. Let's try:

Possible placements:
- 2nd: P or U
- 4th: P or U

But P is not in 2nd, so P must be in 4th, leaving U for 2nd. This gives S U O P _ but we need 5 letters. Wait, pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S _ O _ _

If P is in 4th: S _ O P _
If U is in 2nd: S U O P _

But we need a 5th letter. We have letters left: common consonants like T, C, M, etc. Since we have S, O, P, U, the 5th letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet ruled out. Let's think of words fitting S _ O P _ with remaining letters.

But we also have U to place. Let's try:

S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, we have S, U, O, P, so the 5th letter must be one of these. Wait, no - the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter.

Wait, the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet. From remaining common letters, let's think of words:

S _ O _ _ with letters S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT
- S P O U T
- Check positions: S(1) ✓, P(2) but P is not in 2nd position (from SPOIL feedback P is in word but not 2nd). So P cannot be 2nd. Thus SPOUT is invalid.

Next possibility: S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter. Let's think of ""SOUTH"":
- S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this would be SOUT_, not matching pattern.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid (P not in 2nd).

S U O P T - but P is 4th, which is allowed (P is in word but not 2nd), and U is 2nd. This gives S U O P T - but this is 5 letters: S, U, O, P, T. This seems valid.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Another option: S P O U T - invalid for P position.

S U O P T seems to fit:
- S(1) ✓
- U(2) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 2nd)
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

But we have S, U, O, P, T - this seems valid.

But let's think of more common words. Another possibility: S P O U N - but N is out.

S P O U L - L is out.

S C O P U - but C hasn't been tested, and positions: S C O P U - P is 4th (allowed), U is 5th (allowed), C is new.

But is SCOPU a word? Doesn't seem common.

S U O P T - not a common word.

Another approach: since we have S, O, P, U, and need one more letter, let's try common consonants like C, M, T.

Looking for S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT - P is 2nd (invalid).

SOUTH - S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this is SOUT_, not matching.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this would be S T O P U, but pattern is S _ O _ _, so 2nd is T, 4th is P, 5th is U.

This gives S T O P U - check:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- U(5) - allowed

This seems valid and common: SToup? Actually, STOUP is archaic, but STOUP is not common.

SPOUT is invalid for P position.

Another option: S U O T P - but T is 4th, P is 5th.

But S U O T P - not a word.

S T O P U - seems like the closest valid option.

But let's think of ""SOUTH"" again - S O U T H - positions: S(1), O(3), U(4), T(5), H(2). But this would be S H O U T - but O is 3rd, so S H O U T - this is SHOUT.

Check SHOUT:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

This seems valid and common.

But we have letters in word: S, O, P, U, T, H - but we only have 5 letters, so must be S, O, P, U, T or S, O, U, T plus one more.

Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter, or S, O, P, U plus one more.

Looking at SHOUT: S, H, O, U, T - this contains S, O, U, T, but not P. So missing P.

Thus must include P.

Thus the word must be S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

S T O P U - as before.

S C O P U - SCOPU - not common.

S M O K U - no.

Another approach: list 5-letter words starting with S, O in 3rd, containing P and U.

Possible: S P O U T - invalid P position.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - not common.

S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S O P T U - O is 2nd, but O must be 3rd.

Thus seems the only possible is S U O P T - but this is not a word.

Wait, let's think differently: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid.

Thus must be S _ O _ _ with P in 4th or 5th, U in 2nd or 5th.

But pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th or 5th] [remaining]

We have P and U to place.

If P is 4th: S [2nd] O P [5th], then 2nd and 5th must be U and one more.

But 2nd can't be P (already 4th), and must be U or new letter.

But we have S, O, P, U, and one more.

Thus possible: S U O P [new], but need 5th letter.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this is STOUP, which is archaic.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

S M O K U - no.

S W O P U - SWOPU - no.

S H O P U - SHOPU - no.

S L O P U - L is out.

S V O P U - no.

Thus seems the only possible is S T O P U (STOUP), but it's archaic.

Alternative: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which contradicts feedback.

Thus must be S U O P T - but not a word.

Wait, let's re-examine feedback:

From SPOIL:
- S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)

P(-) means P is in word but not 2nd position.

Thus P can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th, but O is 3rd, so P must be 4th or 5th.

Similarly, U(-) from SOUND means U is in word but not 3rd position. Since O is 3rd, U can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Thus possible placements:

Case 1: P is 4th
   S _ O P _
   Then U must be 2nd or 5th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O P _ - need 5th letter. Letters used: S, U, O, P. Need one more. Common consonants: T, C, M, etc. S U O P T - not a word.
   - If U is 5th: S _ O P U - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

Case 2: P is 5th
   S _ O _ P
   Then U must be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But O is 3rd, so U is 2nd or 4th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O _ P - 4th letter must be new consonant. S U O T P - not a word.
   - If U is 4th: S _ O U P - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S T O U P - this is SToup, archaic, but ""stoup"" is a word (a basin for holy water).

Thus the most plausible word is STOUP.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Thus guess: STOUPBased on the feedback:
- S is fixed in 1st position.
- O is fixed in 3rd position.
- P is in the word but not 2nd position.
- U is in the word but not 3rd position (already O).
- Letters not in word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L.

The only remaining placement for P and U is:
- P must be 4th or 5th.
- U must be 2nd or 4th (if P is 5th).

This leads to the word ""STOUP"" (S T O U P), where:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- P(5) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 5th)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with O in the middle position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
- It contains S somewhere except the 4th position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Good next consonants to test are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since S must appear, let’s try a word that places S in a new position and introduces new common letters. A strong candidate is “POINT”:

- P: new letter
- O: already confirmed in 3rd spot
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- Also moves S out of 4th position (it’s not in POINT anyway).

But wait, we know S is in the word, so POINT would miss that. Let me pick a word that includes S in a different spot and covers new letters. “STONY” would place S in 1st position, but we don’t know about T, N, Y yet. 

Another option is “SOUND”:
- S in 1st position (new spot)
- O confirmed in 3rd
- U: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- D: new consonant

This seems optimal as it tests S in a new spot and introduces several new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is now confirmed in the 1st position (✓).
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (this contradicts the first feedback where O was marked as ✓ in the 3rd position).  
     However, the only way both can be true is if the feedback for SOUND was mis-typed. The symbol ""-"" means ""in word but wrong position,"" so O being ""-"" in SOUND implies O is NOT in the 3rd position, which conflicts with the first feedback. This must be an error in the feedback provided.

Assuming the feedback for SOUND is correct (S is 1st letter, O is in word but not 3rd), we must reinterpret the first feedback. The only consistent way is that the first feedback's ""O(✓)"" was actually indicating O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (because in SOUND the O is in 2nd position and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not 2nd). This suggests the feedback might have been mis-recorded.

Re-reading carefully:
- In AROSE, O was marked as ✓, which means it's in the word AND in the correct position (3rd).
- In SOUND, O was marked as -, meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd position (which is consistent with it being in 3rd).

So the confirmed facts are:
- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, U
- Letters still to test: common consonants like T, L, C, M, P, etc.

A good next guess would be ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st) confirmed
- P: new consonant
- O (3rd) confirmed
- I: new vowel
- L: new consonant

This tests P, I, L and fits the pattern S _ O _ _.

Guess 3: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
   - S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

2. SOUND → S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in the 1st position.
   - O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (consistent with it being in 3rd).
   - U is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

3. SPOIL → S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
   - S is in the 1st position (confirmed).
   - O is in the 3rd position (confirmed).
   - P is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
   - I and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters in the word: S, O, P, U
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L
- Positions to fill: 2nd and 4th letters.

We have P and U still to place. P is not in 2nd position, U is not in 3rd position (already 3rd is O), so U could be in 4th position, and P could be in 2nd or 4th, but 4th could take U or P. Let's try:

Possible placements:
- 2nd: P or U
- 4th: P or U

But P is not in 2nd, so P must be in 4th, leaving U for 2nd. This gives S U O P _ but we need 5 letters. Wait, pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S _ O _ _

If P is in 4th: S _ O P _
If U is in 2nd: S U O P _

But we need a 5th letter. We have letters left: common consonants like T, C, M, etc. Since we have S, O, P, U, the 5th letter must be one of the remaining consonants not yet ruled out. Let's think of words fitting S _ O P _ with remaining letters.

But we also have U to place. Let's try:

S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, we have S, U, O, P, so the 5th letter must be one of these. Wait, no - the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter.

Wait, the letters in the word are S, O, P, U, and one more letter that hasn't been tested yet. From remaining common letters, let's think of words:

S _ O _ _ with letters S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT
- S P O U T
- Check positions: S(1) ✓, P(2) but P is not in 2nd position (from SPOIL feedback P is in word but not 2nd). So P cannot be 2nd. Thus SPOUT is invalid.

Next possibility: S U O P ? - but we need a 5th letter. Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter. Let's think of ""SOUTH"":
- S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this would be SOUT_, not matching pattern.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid (P not in 2nd).

S U O P T - but P is 4th, which is allowed (P is in word but not 2nd), and U is 2nd. This gives S U O P T - but this is 5 letters: S, U, O, P, T. This seems valid.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Another option: S P O U T - invalid for P position.

S U O P T seems to fit:
- S(1) ✓
- U(2) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 2nd)
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

But we have S, U, O, P, T - this seems valid.

But let's think of more common words. Another possibility: S P O U N - but N is out.

S P O U L - L is out.

S C O P U - but C hasn't been tested, and positions: S C O P U - P is 4th (allowed), U is 5th (allowed), C is new.

But is SCOPU a word? Doesn't seem common.

S U O P T - not a common word.

Another approach: since we have S, O, P, U, and need one more letter, let's try common consonants like C, M, T.

Looking for S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: SPOUT - P is 2nd (invalid).

SOUTH - S O U T H - but O is 3rd, so S _ O U T - but this is SOUT_, not matching.

Wait, the pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th] [5th]

We have letters: S, O, P, U, and one more.

Let's try:
S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this would be S T O P U, but pattern is S _ O _ _, so 2nd is T, 4th is P, 5th is U.

This gives S T O P U - check:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- P(4) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- U(5) - allowed

This seems valid and common: SToup? Actually, STOUP is archaic, but STOUP is not common.

SPOUT is invalid for P position.

Another option: S U O T P - but T is 4th, P is 5th.

But S U O T P - not a word.

S T O P U - seems like the closest valid option.

But let's think of ""SOUTH"" again - S O U T H - positions: S(1), O(3), U(4), T(5), H(2). But this would be S H O U T - but O is 3rd, so S H O U T - this is SHOUT.

Check SHOUT:
- S(1) ✓
- H(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- T(5) - new letter

This seems valid and common.

But we have letters in word: S, O, P, U, T, H - but we only have 5 letters, so must be S, O, P, U, T or S, O, U, T plus one more.

Actually, the word must contain S, O, P, U, and one more letter, or S, O, P, U plus one more.

Looking at SHOUT: S, H, O, U, T - this contains S, O, U, T, but not P. So missing P.

Thus must include P.

Thus the word must be S _ O _ _ with S, O, P, U, and one more.

Possible word: S P O U T - P is 2nd (invalid).

S U O P T - as before.

S T O P U - as before.

S C O P U - SCOPU - not common.

S M O K U - no.

Another approach: list 5-letter words starting with S, O in 3rd, containing P and U.

Possible: S P O U T - invalid P position.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - not common.

S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S O P T U - O is 2nd, but O must be 3rd.

Thus seems the only possible is S U O P T - but this is not a word.

Wait, let's think differently: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which is invalid.

Thus must be S _ O _ _ with P in 4th or 5th, U in 2nd or 5th.

But pattern is S _ O _ _, so:

S [2nd] O [4th or 5th] [remaining]

We have P and U to place.

If P is 4th: S [2nd] O P [5th], then 2nd and 5th must be U and one more.

But 2nd can't be P (already 4th), and must be U or new letter.

But we have S, O, P, U, and one more.

Thus possible: S U O P [new], but need 5th letter.

S U O P T - not a word.

S T O P U - but O is 3rd, so S T O P U - this is STOUP, which is archaic.

Another possibility: S P O T U - P is 2nd (invalid).

S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

S M O K U - no.

S W O P U - SWOPU - no.

S H O P U - SHOPU - no.

S L O P U - L is out.

S V O P U - no.

Thus seems the only possible is S T O P U (STOUP), but it's archaic.

Alternative: maybe the word is S P O U T - but P is 2nd, which contradicts feedback.

Thus must be S U O P T - but not a word.

Wait, let's re-examine feedback:

From SPOIL:
- S(✓) P(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x)

P(-) means P is in word but not 2nd position.

Thus P can be 3rd, 4th, or 5th, but O is 3rd, so P must be 4th or 5th.

Similarly, U(-) from SOUND means U is in word but not 3rd position. Since O is 3rd, U can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th.

Thus possible placements:

Case 1: P is 4th
   S _ O P _
   Then U must be 2nd or 5th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O P _ - need 5th letter. Letters used: S, U, O, P. Need one more. Common consonants: T, C, M, etc. S U O P T - not a word.
   - If U is 5th: S _ O P U - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S C O P U - SCOPU - no.

Case 2: P is 5th
   S _ O _ P
   Then U must be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. But O is 3rd, so U is 2nd or 4th.
   - If U is 2nd: S U O _ P - 4th letter must be new consonant. S U O T P - not a word.
   - If U is 4th: S _ O U P - 2nd letter must be new consonant. S T O U P - this is SToup, archaic, but ""stoup"" is a word (a basin for holy water).

Thus the most plausible word is STOUP.

But let's check if T has been ruled out - no, T hasn't been used yet.

Thus guess: STOUPBased on the feedback:
- S is fixed in 1st position.
- O is fixed in 3rd position.
- P is in the word but not 2nd position.
- U is in the word but not 3rd position (already O).
- Letters not in word: A, R, E, N, D, I, L.

The only remaining placement for P and U is:
- P must be 4th or 5th.
- U must be 2nd or 4th (if P is 5th).

This leads to the word ""STOUP"" (S T O U P), where:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) - new letter
- O(3) ✓
- U(4) - allowed (U is in word, not restricted from 4th)
- P(5) - allowed (P is in word, not restricted from 5th)

From Guess 4 (STOUP) we received:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.
- U(✓) – U is correct in position 4.
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 5.

So the secret word is now fully determined:
Position 1: S
Position 2: ?
Position 3: O
Position 4: U
Position 5: P

We still need to find the letter for position 2.  
Letters already ruled out across all guesses:  
A, R, E, N, D, I, L, T

Common remaining consonants that haven’t been tried and fit here:  
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y

The most common and likely candidate is “H”, forming the word **SHOUP**.  
Let’s verify:  
- S(1) ✓, H(2), O(3) ✓, U(4) ✓, P(5) ✓  
- All letters are still allowed and no conflicts.

Therefore, the next (and final) guess is SHOUP.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with O in the middle position.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.\n- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E(x) – E is not in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _\n- It contains S somewhere except the 4th position.\n- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.\n\nGood next consonants to test are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since S must appear, let’s try a word that places S in a new position and introduces new common letters. A strong candidate is “POINT”:\n\n- P: new letter\n- O: already confirmed in 3rd spot\n- I: new vowel\n- N: new consonant\n- T: new consonant\n- Also moves S out of 4th position (it’s not in POINT anyway).\n\nBut wait, we know S is in the word, so POINT would miss that. Let me pick a word that includes S in a different spot and covers new letters. “STONY” would place S in 1st position, but we don’t know about T, N, Y yet. \n\nAnother option is “SOUND”:\n- S in 1st position (new spot)\n- O confirmed in 3rd\n- U: new vowel\n- N: new consonant\n- D: new consonant\n\nThis seems optimal as it tests S in a new spot and introduces several new letters.\n\n<guess>SOUND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(-) U(-) N(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two pieces of feedback:\n\n1.

The symbol ""-"" means ""in word but wrong position,"" so O being ""-"" in SOUND implies O is NOT in the 3rd position, which conflicts with the first feedback. This must be an error in the feedback provided.\n\nAssuming the feedback for SOUND is correct (S is 1st letter, O is in word but not 3rd), we must reinterpret the first feedback.
