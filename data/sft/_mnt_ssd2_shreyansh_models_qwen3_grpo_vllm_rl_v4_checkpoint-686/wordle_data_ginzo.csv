2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" - it also contains S, L, A, T, E. However, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly more vowels which might help identify vowel positions early.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

2. Introduce one new, common consonant.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" - it also contains S, L, A, T, E. However, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly more vowels which might help identify vowel positions early.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

Next, I want to test new letters while placing O in a different position. The remaining common letters (since A, R, S, E are out) are T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A good word would use O in a different spot and introduce several new common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate - it has O in the 2nd position (not 3rd), and introduces P, I, N, T. However, I'll go with ""DOING"" instead because:
- O is in 2nd position (different from 3rd)
- Introduces D, I, N, G (all new letters)
- G is a common ending letter

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): O, I, N, G  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in slot 3 (from AROSE) or slot 2 (from DOING).
- I cannot be in slot 3 (from DOING).
- N cannot be in slot 4 (from DOING).
- G cannot be in slot 5 (from DOING).

We still need to place O, I, N, G into the five slots, and we have one more unknown letter.  
The remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried are T, L, C, M, P, Y, B, F, H, K, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Use all four known letters (O, I, N, G) in new positions.
2. Introduce one new, common consonant.
3. Avoid any disallowed positions for the known letters.

Let’s try “GONIF”:
- G moves to slot 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 5).
- O moves to slot 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 3).
- N moves to slot 3 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 4).
- I moves to slot 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 3).
- F is a new consonant.

This tests all four known letters in fresh slots plus one new letter.

The “O(-)” means O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
Previously, from DOING: O(-) meant O not in position 2.  
From GONIF: O(-) meant O not in position 2 again (but actually position 2 in GONIF was O, so it was “not in position 2”).  
From GINOT: O(-) means O not in position 4.

So the only positions O has never been ruled out are: 3 and 5.  
But position 3 is already N, so O must be in position 5.

Therefore the word is G I N _ O.

The missing 4th letter must be a new letter (since all others are ruled out or placed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" - it also contains S, L, A, T, E. However, I'll go with AROSE as it has slightly more vowels which might help identify vowel positions early.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

Next, I want to test new letters while placing O in a different position. The remaining common letters (since A, R, S, E are out) are T, N, I, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

A good word would use O in a different spot and introduce several new common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate - it has O in the 2nd position (not 3rd), and introduces P, I, N, T. However, I'll go with ""DOING"" instead because:
- O is in 2nd position (different from 3rd)
- Introduces D, I, N, G (all new letters)
- G is a common ending letter

Guess 2: DOING -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) G(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, D  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): O, I, N, G  

Positions ruled out:
- O cannot be in slot 3 (from AROSE) or slot 2 (from DOING).
- I cannot be in slot 3 (from DOING).
- N cannot be in slot 4 (from DOING).
- G cannot be in slot 5 (from DOING).

We still need to place O, I, N, G into the five slots, and we have one more unknown letter.  
The remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried are T, L, C, M, P, Y, B, F, H, K, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Use all four known letters (O, I, N, G) in new positions.
2. Introduce one new, common consonant.
3. Avoid any disallowed positions for the known letters.

Let’s try “GONIF”:
- G moves to slot 1 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 5).
- O moves to slot 2 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 3).
- N moves to slot 3 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 4).
- I moves to slot 4 (allowed, since it was only ruled out of slot 3).
- F is a new consonant.

This tests all four known letters in fresh slots plus one new letter.

Guess 3: GONIF -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(-) N(✓) I(-) F(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, D, F  
Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions so far:  
- G is in position 1 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  

Letters that ARE in the word but still in wrong positions:  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from DOING and GONIF)  
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from DOING and GONIF)

So the word looks like: G _ N _ _  
We still need to place O and I in the remaining slots (2, 4, 5) without repeating disallowed positions.

Possible placements:
- O can be in slot 4 or 5 (not 2, 3, or 5 in previous guesses, but slot 5 was only ruled out for O in DOING, so slot 5 is allowed for O)
- I can be in slot 2 or 5 (slot 2 was never ruled out for I)

Let’s try “GONIL”:
- G in 1 ✓
- O in 2 (but O was ruled out of slot 2 in DOING) → invalid

Try “GONTO”:
- G in 1 ✓
- O in 2 (invalid again)

Try “GONPI”:
- G in 1 ✓
- O in 3 (but N is already in 3) → invalid

Try “GONIC”:
- G in 1 ✓
- O in 2 (invalid)

Try “GONTO” again – same issue.

Better approach: O must be in 4 or 5, I must be in 2 or 5.

Option 1: O in 4, I in 2 → G I N O _
Need a 5th letter not used yet: common remaining consonants are T, L, C, M, P, Y, B, H, K.

“GINOT” – but T is common and fits: G I N O T. Check positions:
- G1 ✓
- I2 (allowed)
- N3 ✓
- O4 (allowed)
- T new letter.

This seems valid.

Option 2: O in 5, I in 2 → G I N _ O
Need 4th letter: GINCO, GINDO (but D is out), GINHO, GINMO, etc. GINCO is a word (short for accounting), but less common. GINCO might be acceptable, but let’s stick with GINOT which is more common.

Thus, the best next guess is GINOT.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 4: GINOT -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) I(✓) N(✓) O(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the four rounds we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, D, F, T  
Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:  
- G in position 1 (✓)  
- I in position 2 (✓)  
- N in position 3 (✓)  

Letters that ARE in the word but still in wrong positions:  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from DOING, GONIF, GINOT)  
- But position 1 is already taken by G, so O has no legal position left. This is impossible, meaning our assumption must be wrong.

Wait – let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: GINOT  
Feedback: G(✓) I(✓) N(✓) O(-) T(x)

The “O(-)” means O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
Previously, from DOING: O(-) meant O not in position 2.  
From GONIF: O(-) meant O not in position 2 again (but actually position 2 in GONIF was O, so it was “not in position 2”).  
From GINOT: O(-) means O not in position 4.

So the only positions O has never been ruled out are: 3 and 5.  
But position 3 is already N, so O must be in position 5.

Therefore the word is G I N _ O.

The missing 4th letter must be a new letter (since all others are ruled out or placed).  
Common unused consonants: C, L, M, P, Y, B, H, K.

Possible words:  
- GINCO (short for accounting)  
- GINPO (not a word)  
- GINMO (not a word)  
- GINBO (not a word)  
- GINKO (valid word, also a company)

“GINKO” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- G1 ✓  
- I2 ✓  
- N3 ✓  
- K4 (new letter)  
- O5 (only remaining allowed position for O) ✓

This should be the correct word.
