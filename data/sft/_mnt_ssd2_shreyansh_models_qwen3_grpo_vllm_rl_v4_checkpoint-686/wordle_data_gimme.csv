For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters in the word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial for narrowing down vowels early.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does not contain A, R, O, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let’s try a word like “UNTIE” – but that has an O (no), or “UNTIL” – no, ends with L.  
A valid word ending in E and avoiding forbidden letters: “UNTIE” has an O, so skip.  
“ELITE” – uses L, I, T, E. Ends with E, no A, R, O, S.  
“ELITE” seems like a strong second guess.

Alternative: “INITE” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“ELITE” is valid and covers new letters (L, I, T).

So my next guess is ELITE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters in the word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial for narrowing down vowels early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does not contain A, R, O, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let’s try a word like “UNTIE” – but that has an O (no), or “UNTIL” – no, ends with L.  
A valid word ending in E and avoiding forbidden letters: “UNTIE” has an O, so skip.  
“ELITE” – uses L, I, T, E. Ends with E, no A, R, O, S.  
“ELITE” seems like a strong second guess.

Alternative: “INITE” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“ELITE” is valid and covers new letters (L, I, T).

So my next guess is ELITE.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in the word and is the last letter.  
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)  
   - The first E is wrong-position (but E is still in the word, just not in position 1).  
   - L and T are not in the word.  
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   - The final E is correct in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.  
- Contains I somewhere (but not in position 3).  
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, L, T.  
- Vowels left to try: I, U (E is already fixed at the end).  
- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.  
- Uses I somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- “INBOX” – contains N, B, X (all allowed) and I in position 2. Ends with X, not E – invalid.  
- “CHIDE” – C, H, D allowed; I in position 3 (but feedback says I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in 3).  
- “MIDGE” – M, D, G allowed; I in position 3 – again invalid.  
- “WIDEN” – W, D allowed; I in position 2; ends with N – invalid.  
- “FICHE” – F, C allowed; I in position 2; ends with E – valid.  
- “PINE” – too short.  
- “WIDEN” – ends with N.  
- “CHIME” – C, H, M allowed; I in position 3 – invalid.  
- “FICHE” seems valid: F, I, C, H, E – all letters allowed, I in position 2.

From all feedback so far:

   – I is now confirmed in position 2.

Allowed letters left: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels U (since I and E are used, and A, O are out).

We need three more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that are not in the excluded set.

Among these, “DIN” is a common stem, but “DINGE” is not a standard English word.  
“BINGE” is valid.  
“KINGE” is archaic but valid.  
“PINE” is too short.  
“WINE” is 4 letters.  
“YIN” is 3.

“GIVE” is 4 letters, but we need 5.  
“GIVE” + E?  
“GIVEN” – but that’s 5 letters: G, I, V, E, N.  
Check if G, I, V, E, N are all allowed:  
G – allowed  
I – confirmed in position 2  
V – allowed  
E – confirmed in position 5  
N – allowed  

“GIVEN” is a valid 5-letter English word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters in the word.\n\nAnother good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

""GIVEN"" was tried.  
""GIGUE"" – G, I, G, U, E. G is allowed, I is allowed, U is allowed, E is allowed.  
But we need to check if G is allowed in position 3.  
""GIGUE"" is a valid word. Let me check letters:  
G – allowed (position 1)  
I – allowed (position 2)  
G – allowed (position 3)  
U – allowed  
E – allowed (position 5)  

""GIGUE"" fits all constraints.

""GIRLY"" – R and L are ruled out.  
""GITHE"" – T and H are ruled out.  
""GIZMO"" – Z, M, O, but O is ruled out.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is ""GIMLE"" but L is ruled out.  
""GIVEN"" was tried.  
""GIGUE"" – G, I, G, U, E. G is allowed, I is allowed, U is allowed, E is allowed.  
But we need to check if G is allowed in position 3.  
""GIGUE"" is a valid word. Let me check letters:  
G – allowed (position 1)  
I – allowed (position 2)  
G – allowed (position 3)  
U – allowed  
E – allowed (position 5)  

""GIGUE"" fits all constraints.  

Another option: ""GIPSY"" – but S is ruled out.  
""GIRLY"" – R and L are ruled out.  
""GITHE"" – T and H are ruled out.  
""GIZMO"" – Z, M, O, but O is ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the correct positions or identifying letters in the word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial for narrowing down vowels early.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.  
I now need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Does not contain A, R, O, S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let’s try a word like “UNTIE” – but that has an O (no), or “UNTIL” – no, ends with L.  
A valid word ending in E and avoiding forbidden letters: “UNTIE” has an O, so skip.  
“ELITE” – uses L, I, T, E. Ends with E, no A, R, O, S.  
“ELITE” seems like a strong second guess.

Alternative: “INITE” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“ELITE” is valid and covers new letters (L, I, T).

So my next guess is ELITE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ELITE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in the word and is the last letter.  
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)  
   - The first E is wrong-position (but E is still in the word, just not in position 1).  
   - L and T are not in the word.  
   - I is in the word but in the wrong position.  
   - The final E is correct in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.  
- Contains I somewhere (but not in position 3).  
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, L, T.  
- Vowels left to try: I, U (E is already fixed at the end).  
- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.  
- Uses I somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- “INBOX” – contains N, B, X (all allowed) and I in position 2. Ends with X, not E – invalid.  
- “CHIDE” – C, H, D allowed; I in position 3 (but feedback says I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in 3).  
- “MIDGE” – M, D, G allowed; I in position 3 – again invalid.  
- “WIDEN” – W, D allowed; I in position 2; ends with N – invalid.  
- “FICHE” – F, C allowed; I in position 2; ends with E – valid.  
- “PINE” – too short.  
- “WIDEN” – ends with N.  
- “CHIME” – C, H, M allowed; I in position 3 – invalid.  
- “FICHE” seems valid: F, I, C, H, E – all letters allowed, I in position 2.

Let’s try FICHE.

Guess 3: FICHE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) C(x) H(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L and T are not in the word.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. FICHE → F(x) I(✓) C(x) H(x) E(✓)  
   – I is now confirmed in position 2.  
   – F, C, H are not in the word.  
   – E is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ I _ _ E  
with the letters already ruled out: A, C, F, H, L, O, R, S, T.

Allowed letters left: B, D, G, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the remaining vowels U (since I and E are used, and A, O are out).

We need three more letters for positions 1, 3, 4 that are not in the excluded set.

Possible consonants: B, D, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Possible vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

Let’s look for a word that fits _ I _ _ E with these constraints.

Candidate words:
- B I D G E → B, D, G allowed, but G is allowed.  
- M I N I E → but N is allowed, but double I is not possible.  
- P I N E → too short.

- Y I N G E → Y, I, N, G, E – all allowed.

- B I N G E, D I N G E, K I N G E, M I N G E, P I N G E, V I N G E, W I N G E, Y I N G E, Z I N G E – these are all valid 5-letter English words.

Among these, “DIN” is a common stem, but “DINGE” is not a standard English word.  
“BINGE” is valid.  
“KINGE” is archaic but valid.  
“PINE” is too short.  
“WINE” is 4 letters.  
“YIN” is 3.  
“ZIN” is 3.  
“VINE” is 4.  
“MINE” is 4.  
“LIME” is 4 but L is excluded.  
“RIME” is 4 but R is excluded.  
“SINE” is 4 but S is excluded.  
“TINE” is 4 but T is excluded.  
“HINE” is 4 but H is excluded.  
“CINE” is 4 but C is excluded.  
“FIVE” is 4 but F is excluded.  
“GIVE” is 4 but G is allowed and V is allowed.  
“GIVE” is 4 letters, but we need 5.  
“GIVE” + E?  
“GIVEN” – but that’s 5 letters: G, I, V, E, N.  
Check if G, I, V, E, N are all allowed:  
G – allowed  
I – confirmed in position 2  
V – allowed  
E – confirmed in position 5  
N – allowed  

“GIVEN” is a valid 5-letter English word.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. ELITE → E(-) L(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L and T are not in the word.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. FICHE → F(x) I(✓) C(x) H(x) E(✓)  
   – I is confirmed in position 2.  
   – F, C, H are not in the word.  
   – E is confirmed in position 5.

4. GIVEN → G(✓) I(✓) V(x) E(-) N(x)  
   – G is in the word and in position 1.

   – V and N are not in the word.  
   – E is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know it’s in position 5).

So the pattern is now:  
G I _ _ E  

Letters already ruled out: A, C, F, H, L, N, O, R, S, T, V.  

Allowed letters left: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it\'s slightly more vowel-heavy which can be beneficial for narrowing down vowels early.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position.\n- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, or S.  \nI now need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E.\n- Does not contain A, R, O, S.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nGood remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  \nGood remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).\n\nLet’s try a word like “UNTIE” – but that has an O (no), or “UNTIL” – no, ends with L.  \nA valid word ending in E and avoiding forbidden letters: “UNTIE” has an O, so skip.  \n“ELITE” – uses L, I, T, E.
