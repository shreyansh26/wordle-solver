### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.

- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).

Let me try a word like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before, now new position).
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 3 (allowed since A was in position 1 before, now new position).
- No R, O, E.

Let's summarize the information we have so far.

1. From AROSE:
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. From STAND:
   - A is in position 3 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. From CLASH:
   - C, L, H are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word must:
- Have A in position 3.
- Contain S in position 2 (since it can't be 1, 4, or 5).
- Not contain: R, O, E, T, N, D, C, L, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have positions 1 and 5 to fill with these remaining letters. A good candidate is ""B"" for position 1 and ""K"" for position 5, forming ""BSAK_"". Wait, that's not a valid word. Let me think of valid words with S in position 2 and A in position 3.

Possible structure: _ S A _ _
Valid words with this pattern and no forbidden letters: ""GASPY"", ""VASAL"", ""MASSE"", but ""MASSE"" has E which is forbidden. ""GASPY"" uses G, A, S, P, Y - all allowed. ""VASAL"" uses V, A, S, A, L - but L is forbidden. ""GASPY"" seems valid.

Let me check ""GASPY"":
- G: new letter
- A: position 3 (correct)
- S: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- Y: new letter

No forbidden letters are used. This seems like a good guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A and S.
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1.
4. Has S not in position 4.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Let me try a word like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before, now new position).
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 3 (allowed since A was in position 1 before, now new position).
- No R, O, E.

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down possibilities.

2. It contains S (not in position 1 or 4).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N, D.

Letters left to consider: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Positions left to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 3 is A.
- S must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
- We need two more consonants/vowels from the remaining letters.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 to maximize options. Then positions 1, 2, 4 need to be filled with unused letters. A good candidate is “CLASH”:
- C, L, H are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches).
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, T, N, D) are used.

“CLASH” seems valid and will give us info on C, L, H.

Let's update what we know after the four guesses.

Known facts:
1. A is in position 3 (✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback on STAND, CLASH, GASPY).  
   That leaves only position 3 for S, but position 3 is already A.  
   This is impossible, so my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback for GASPY:
- G(x) – G not in word  
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 3  
- S(-) – S is in word but wrong position (here it’s in position 2)  
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 4  
- Y(x) – Y not in word  

So:
- S is in word, NOT in position 2.  
- P is correct in position 4.  
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, N, D, C, L, H, G, Y.

Current template: _ _ A P _

S must go in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2, 3, 4).  
We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern:
- S _ A P _  or  _ _ A P S

Possible candidates:
- S P A R K → but R is ruled out.  
- S W A P S → S repeats (invalid).  
- S K A P S → S repeats.  
- S M A P S → S repeats.  
- S W A P S → repeats.  
- S K A P E → E is ruled out.  
- S K A P S → repeats.  
- S M A P S → repeats.  
- S W A P S → repeats.  
- S K A P S → repeats.  
- S M A P S → repeats.  

Only remaining single-S placements are positions 1 or 5.  
Let’s list valid English words of the form:
1. S _ A P _  
   – S B A P ? (no)  
   – S K A P ? (SKAPS not a word)  
   – S M A P ? (SMAPS not a word)  
   – S W A P ? (SWAPS is valid) – but S repeats at end.  

2. _ _ A P S  
   – B R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – F R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – B R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – M A A P S → repeats A.  
   – B A A P S → repeats A.  
   – F A A P S → repeats A.  
   – M A P P S → repeats P.  
   – F A P P S → repeats P.  
   – B A P P S → repeats P.  
   – M A S P S → S repeats.  
   – F A S P S → S repeats.  
   – B A S P S → S repeats.  
   – M A S P S → S repeats.  

The only valid, non-repeating word that fits is:
S W A P S → but S repeats.  
Wait, is there another?

Looking again:  
S _ A P _  
– S B A P ? (no)  
– S K A P ? (SKAPS not a word)  
– S M A P ? (SMAPS not a word)  
– S W A P ? (SWAPS is valid, but S repeats at end).  

Actually, SWAPS is a valid 5-letter word, and the repeated S is acceptable because the feedback only told us S is in the word and not in position 2; it didn’t say S can’t repeat.  

Let’s try SWAPS:
- S in position 1 (allowed)  
- W new letter  
- A in position 3 (correct)  
- P in position 4 (correct)  
- S in position 5 (allowed, even if S appears twice).

Actually, SWAPS is a valid 5-letter word, and the repeated S is acceptable because the feedback only told us S is in the word and not in position 2; it didn’t say S can’t repeat.  

Let’s try SWAPS:
- S in position 1 (allowed)  
- W new letter  
- A in position 3 (correct)  
- P in position 4 (correct)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good letter distribution across positions

This gives me maximum information about which letters might be in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A and S.
2. Does not have R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1.
4. Has S not in position 4.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Let me try a word like ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S was in position 4 before, now new position).
- T, N, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 3 (allowed since A was in position 1 before, now new position).
- No R, O, E.

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down possibilities.

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on STAND:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N is not in the word.
- D is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word has A in position 3.
2. It contains S (not in position 1 or 4).
3. It does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N, D.

Letters left to consider: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Positions left to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- Position 3 is A.
- S must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 4).
- We need two more consonants/vowels from the remaining letters.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 to maximize options. Then positions 1, 2, 4 need to be filled with unused letters. A good candidate is “CLASH”:
- C, L, H are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (matches).
- No forbidden letters (R, O, E, T, N, D) are used.

“CLASH” seems valid and will give us info on C, L, H.

Guess 3: CLASH -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's summarize the information we have so far.

1. From AROSE:
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. From STAND:
   - A is in position 3 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, N, D are not in the word.

3. From CLASH:
   - C, L, H are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word must:
- Have A in position 3.
- Contain S in position 2 (since it can't be 1, 4, or 5).
- Not contain: R, O, E, T, N, D, C, L, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have positions 1 and 5 to fill with these remaining letters. A good candidate is ""B"" for position 1 and ""K"" for position 5, forming ""BSAK_"". Wait, that's not a valid word. Let me think of valid words with S in position 2 and A in position 3.

Possible structure: _ S A _ _
Valid words with this pattern and no forbidden letters: ""GASPY"", ""VASAL"", ""MASSE"", but ""MASSE"" has E which is forbidden. ""GASPY"" uses G, A, S, P, Y - all allowed. ""VASAL"" uses V, A, S, A, L - but L is forbidden. ""GASPY"" seems valid.

Let me check ""GASPY"":
- G: new letter
- A: position 3 (correct)
- S: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- Y: new letter

No forbidden letters are used. This seems like a good guess.

Let's update what we know after the four guesses.

Known facts:
1. A is in position 3 (✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from feedback on STAND, CLASH, GASPY).  
   That leaves only position 3 for S, but position 3 is already A.  
   This is impossible, so my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback for GASPY:
- G(x) – G not in word  
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 3  
- S(-) – S is in word but wrong position (here it’s in position 2)  
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 4  
- Y(x) – Y not in word  

So:
- S is in word, NOT in position 2.  
- P is correct in position 4.  
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, N, D, C, L, H, G, Y.

Current template: _ _ A P _

S must go in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2, 3, 4).  
We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern:
- S _ A P _  or  _ _ A P S

Possible candidates:
- S P A R K → but R is ruled out.  
- S W A P S → S repeats (invalid).  
- S K A P S → S repeats.  
- S M A P S → S repeats.  
- S W A P S → repeats.  
- S K A P E → E is ruled out.  
- S K A P S → repeats.  
- S M A P S → repeats.  
- S W A P S → repeats.  
- S K A P S → repeats.  
- S M A P S → repeats.  

Only remaining single-S placements are positions 1 or 5.  
Let’s list valid English words of the form:
1. S _ A P _  
   – S B A P ? (no)  
   – S K A P ? (SKAPS not a word)  
   – S M A P ? (SMAPS not a word)  
   – S W A P ? (SWAPS is valid) – but S repeats at end.  

2. _ _ A P S  
   – B R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – F R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – B R A P S → R ruled out.  
   – M A A P S → repeats A.  
   – B A A P S → repeats A.  
   – F A A P S → repeats A.  
   – M A P P S → repeats P.  
   – F A P P S → repeats P.  
   – B A P P S → repeats P.  
   – M A S P S → S repeats.  
   – F A S P S → S repeats.  
   – B A S P S → S repeats.  
   – M A S P S → S repeats.  

The only valid, non-repeating word that fits is:
S W A P S → but S repeats.  
Wait, is there another?

Looking again:  
S _ A P _  
– S B A P ? (no)  
– S K A P ? (SKAPS not a word)  
– S M A P ? (SMAPS not a word)  
– S W A P ? (SWAPS is valid, but S repeats at end).  

Actually, SWAPS is a valid 5-letter word, and the repeated S is acceptable because the feedback only told us S is in the word and not in position 2; it didn’t say S can’t repeat.  

Let’s try SWAPS:
- S in position 1 (allowed)  
- W new letter  
- A in position 3 (correct)  
- P in position 4 (correct)  
- S in position 5 (allowed, even if S appears twice).  

This fits all constraints.

Let's carefully extract every constraint from all feedback so far.

1. Position 3 must be A (✓ in every guess from STAND onward).
2. S is in the word but:
   - cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (feedback shows S is wrong in each of those positions across different guesses).
   - The only remaining position is position 3, but position 3 is already A.
   - This is impossible, so my interpretation must be flawed.

Re-examining the feedback for SWAPS:
- S(-)  – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- W(x) – W is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
- P(✓) – P is correct in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

Ah! The final feedback shows:
- S is correct in position 5 (✓).
- Earlier ""-"" for S simply meant ""not in that specific position"", but the final ""✓"" in position 5 confirms S is indeed in position 5.

So the word must be: _ _ A P S

Letters already ruled out (from all guesses and feedback):
R, O, E, T, N, D, C, L, H, G, Y, W.

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""APS"" with A in position 3 and P in position 4. The only common English word fitting this pattern is:

F A P S  → but that's only 4 letters.
Wait, we need 5 letters: _ _ A P S.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ""APS"":
- B R A P S → R is ruled out.
- F R A P S → R is ruled out.
- M A P S → too short.
- S K A P S → K is allowed, but S repeats (allowed since we only know one S is required).
- S M A P S → M is allowed, S repeats.
- S W A P S → W is ruled out.
- S P A R S → R is ruled out.
- S K A P S is the only non-repeating valid word: S K A P S.

But S is already confirmed in position 5, so position 1 can be S (no restriction against it), giving S K A P S.

However, S K A P S has S in positions 1 and 5 – this is allowed unless feedback explicitly forbids repeats, which it doesn't.

But let's check if there's a word without repeating S: only possibility is _ K A P S or _ M A P S, but no valid word fits.

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ _ A P S is S K A P S.

But let's verify: S K A P S
- S in position 1: allowed (no feedback against it).
- K new letter.
- A in position 3: correct.
- P in position 4: correct.
- S in position 5: correct.

This satisfies all constraints.

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""APS"" with A in position 3 and P in position 4. The only common English word fitting this pattern is:

F A P S  → but that's only 4 letters.
Wait, we need 5 letters: _ _ A P S.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ""APS"":
- B R A P S → R is ruled out.
- F R A P S → R is ruled out.
- M A P S → too short.
- S K A P S → K is allowed, but S repeats (allowed since we only know one S is required).
- S M A P S → M is allowed, S repeats.
- S W A P S → W is ruled out.
- S P A R S → R is ruled out.
- S K A P S is the only non-repeating valid word: S K A P S.

But S is already confirmed in position 5, so position 1 can be S (no restriction against it), giving S K A P S.

However, S K A P S has S in positions 1 and 5 – this is allowed unless feedback explicitly forbids repeats, which it doesn't.

But let's check if there's a word without repeating S: only possibility is _ K A P S or _ M A P S, but no valid word fits.

Actually, the only valid word fitting _ _ A P S is S K A P S.

But let's verify: S K A P S
- S in position 1: allowed (no feedback against it).
- K new letter.
- A in position 3: correct.
- P in position 4: correct.
- S in position 5: correct.

This satisfies all constraints.",Guess 6: SKAPS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) K(x) A(✓) P(✓) S(✓),FAIL
