### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful feedback about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters:
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 2.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Known absent letters: A, R, E, T, N, Y, C.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
with O, L, P somewhere in positions 1-4, and one more unknown letter.

Positions ruled out:
- O: 2, 3
- L: 2
- P: 4

Possible positions:
- O can be 1 or 4
- L can be 1, 3, 4
- P can be 1, 2, 3

We need a 5th letter that is not yet tested. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s try placing O in position 1, P in position 2, L in position 3, and pick a new consonant for position 4. A good candidate is “OPALS”, but A is already ruled out.

Next option: O in 1, P in 3, L in 4, and a new letter in 2. “OLIPS” – but I is a vowel we haven’t tested.

A valid word that fits: “OPALS” is invalid (A ruled out). Try “OPIUM” – but U is untested and M is new.

But we need to avoid letters already ruled out. Let’s try “OPIKS” – but K is new.

Actually, let’s use “OPIUM”:
- O in 1 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide useful feedback about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively).
- Does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters we haven’t tested yet (like T, I, N, L, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, E.

A strong candidate is “STONY”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1.
- O moves from position 3 to 2.
- T, N, Y are new letters.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
→ O and S are in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Guess 2: STONY  
S(-) T(x) O(-) N(x) Y(x)  
→ S is in the word but not in position 1, and O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters present: O, S  
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, N, Y  
- Positions ruled out for O: 3  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4

We still need to test other common consonants (L, C, D, P, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, U). A good third guess should place O and S in new positions and introduce several new letters.

Candidate word: “CLOPS”  
- C, L, P are new letters.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  

This gives us 3 new letters plus the confirmed O and S in fresh spots.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively).
- Does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and S in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters we haven’t tested yet (like T, I, N, L, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, E.

A strong candidate is “STONY”:
- S moves from position 4 to 1.
- O moves from position 3 to 2.
- T, N, Y are new letters.

We still need to test other common consonants (L, C, D, P, etc.) and the remaining vowels (I, U). A good third guess should place O and S in new positions and introduce several new letters.

Candidate word: “CLOPS”  
- C, L, P are new letters.  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

We need a 5th letter that is not yet tested. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s try placing O in position 1, P in position 2, L in position 3, and pick a new consonant for position 4. A good candidate is “OPALS”, but A is already ruled out.

Next option: O in 1, P in 3, L in 4, and a new letter in 2. “OLIPS” – but I is a vowel we haven’t tested.

A valid word that fits: “OPALS” is invalid (A ruled out). Try “OPIUM” – but U is untested and M is new.

But we need to avoid letters already ruled out. Let’s try “OPIKS” – but K is new.

Actually, let’s use “OPIUM”:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- P in 3 (allowed)
- I in 2 (new)

- S in 5 (known)

This tests I and U, plus P and O in new positions.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

From Guess 5 (PILOS) we now have:
- P(-) → P is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I(✓) → I is in position 2 and is correct.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O(✓) → O is in position 4 and is correct.
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct.

So the pattern is now: _ I _ O S  
with P and L still needing to be placed in positions 1 and 3 (since P can’t be in 1, and L can’t be in 2 or 3).

The only remaining positions for P and L are 1 and 3.  
Because P can’t be in 1, P must be in 3 and L must be in 1.

Thus the word must be: L I P O S.

Check validity: “LIPOS” is a recognized 5-letter English word (short for liposuction or relating to fat tissue).
