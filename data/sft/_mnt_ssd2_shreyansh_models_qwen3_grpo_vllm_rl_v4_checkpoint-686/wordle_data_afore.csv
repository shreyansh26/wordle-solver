For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters that are all among the most common. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓).

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains A, but A is not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains A somewhere other than the 3rd position. Good letters to try next might include R, N, I, O, C, etc.

Some candidate words:
- CRANE (but T is out, so CRANE is fine)
- CHAIN (but ends in N, not E)
- CRANE: C R A N E - A is in position 3 (same as SLATE), but feedback said A is in wrong position. So CRANE is invalid because A would still be in position 3.
- CRANE is invalid.
- CHAFE: C H A F E - A in position 3 again, same issue.
- CRANE, CHAFE, CRANE - all have A in position 3 which we know is wrong.

Better candidates:
- RANCE: R A N C E - A in position 2, E in position 5. No S, L, T. Contains R, N, C which are common.
- CHANE: C H A N E - A in position 3 is still wrong.

- CHANE is out.
- RANCE seems good.

Another option: CRANE is out because A is in position 3. Next best: RANCE or CHANE or CRANE - but CRANE is invalid. RANCE is valid.

- CRANE: A in position 3 is wrong.
- CRANE: same issue.
- CHANE: A in position 3 is wrong.

Alternative: use words where A is in position 1, 2, or 4.
- ARISE: but S is out.
- ANGEL: but L is out.

- AROSE: S is out.
- ACORN: but ends in N, not E.

Better approach: since E is fixed at position 5, and A must be in positions 1, 2, or 4, and we can't use S, L, T.
