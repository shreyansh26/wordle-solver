For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about what letters might be in the secret word. This should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word but not in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with A, has an O somewhere (but not third), and contains none of R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains O (but not in position 3)
3. Does not contain R, S, or E

Possible patterns: A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _ or A O _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm:
- A M B O D (invalid, contains no O but D is uncommon)
- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B L O (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words that fit A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _.

Possible candidates:
- A L O N G (but has N and G, and O in position 3 - invalid)
- A B O U T (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R D (contains R - invalid)
- A H O L E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O N E (contains E - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A M O N G (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A M O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A N O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A P O K A (contains K - invalid)
- A T O M E (contains E - invalid)
- A T O M Y (Y is possible, but O in position 3 - invalid)
- A U G H T (no O - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X I O T (contains X - invalid)
- A Z O D I (contains Z - invalid)

Hmm, many common words have O in position 3 which is invalid. Let’s try A _ O _ _:

- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R T (contains R - invalid)
- A H O R S (contains R, S - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A P O C Y (contains C - invalid)
- A T O M Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X O N E (contains X, E - invalid)
- A Z O D E (contains Z, E - invalid)

Still struggling. Let’s try A _ _ O _:

- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A M B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A M B O T (invalid)
- A M B O Y (invalid)
- A N B O D (invalid)
- A N B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A N B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A N B O T (invalid)
- A N B O Y (invalid)
- A P B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A P B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A T B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A T B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A V B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A V B O S (contains S - invalid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe I should consider less common words or different consonants.

Another angle: A _ _ O _ with valid letters. Let’s try:

- A L B O N (invalid)
- A L C O N (invalid)
- A L D O N (invalid)
- A L F O N (invalid)
- A L H O N (invalid)
- A L M O N (invalid)
- A L P O N (invalid)
- A L T O N (invalid)
- A L V O N (invalid)

None seem valid. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with A, with O not in position 3, and no R, S, E.

Possible words:
- A B O D Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A D O B E (contains E - invalid)
- A F O D A (invalid)
- A G O D A (invalid)
- A H O D A (invalid)
- A I O N A (invalid)
- A K O D A (invalid)
- A L O D A (invalid)
- A M O D A (invalid)
- A N O D A (invalid)
- A P O D A (invalid)
- A T O D A (invalid)
- A V O D A (invalid)
- A W O D A (invalid)
- A Z O D A (invalid)

This is tough. Maybe ""AFOUL"" - but it has no O in position 3 and no R, S, E:
- A F O U L
  - A(✓) correct position
  - F - not tested yet
  - O - in word but not position 3 (it's position 3 here - invalid)
  
No good. ""ALOUD"" has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AMOUR"" - but has R - invalid.

""ANODE"" - has E - invalid.

""APHID"" - no O - invalid.

""AROMA"" - has R - invalid.

""ADIEU"" - has E - invalid.

""AGLOW"" - no O - invalid.

""ALIKE"" - has E - invalid.

""ALIVE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMBLE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMIDO"" - has O in position 4 - valid pattern A M I D O:
- A(✓) M I D O
- O is in position 5 - not position 3 - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

""AMIDO"" seems to fit:
- A(✓) in position 1
- O in position 5 (not position 3) - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

Let me check if ""AMIDO"" is a valid 5-letter word. It's a variant spelling of ""amida"" which is a medical term for a type of cyst. While it's not super common, it's recognized in Scrabble dictionaries and similar word lists.

Thus, ""AMIDO"" is a reasonable next guess.

- A L T O N (invalid)
- A L V O N (invalid)

None seem valid. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with A, with O not in position 3, and no R, S, E.

Possible words:
- A B O D Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A D O B E (contains E - invalid)
- A F O D A (invalid)
- A G O D A (invalid)

- A T O D A (invalid)
- A V O D A (invalid)
- A W O D A (invalid)
- A Z O D A (invalid)

This is tough. Maybe ""AFOUL"" - but it has no O in position 3 and no R, S, E:

""AMIDO"" seems to fit:

From the new feedback on AMIDO:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – now confirmed in position 5.
- M, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ O
and its remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding:
R, S, E, M, I, D.

We also know the word must be valid English.

Let’s list common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three consonants (or vowels) that fit between A and O, avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good tactic is to try common clusters like “-L-N-” or “-N-G-” etc.

Candidate words:
- A L N O ? – but we need 5 letters ending in O.
- A N T O N – but N is repeated and T is allowed, but “ANTON” is valid.
- A N T O N – letters A, N, T, O, N – N is repeated, but we have no info on N yet.
- A C T O R – contains R, forbidden.
- A L A N O – not common.
- A F T O N – “AFTON” is a proper noun (river), but not ideal.
- A N T O N – seems best among common words.

Let me double-check:
- A N T O N: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 5, and N, T are new letters not yet tested.
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, M, I, D) are used.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (name Anton, or the city Anton).

Thus, the next logical guess is ANTON.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about what letters might be in the secret word. This should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word but not in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with A, has an O somewhere (but not third), and contains none of R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains O (but not in position 3)
3. Does not contain R, S, or E

Possible patterns: A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _ or A O _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm:
- A M B O D (invalid, contains no O but D is uncommon)
- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B L O (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words that fit A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _.

Possible candidates:
- A L O N G (but has N and G, and O in position 3 - invalid)
- A B O U T (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R D (contains R - invalid)
- A H O L E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O N E (contains E - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A M O N G (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A M O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A N O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A P O K A (contains K - invalid)
- A T O M E (contains E - invalid)
- A T O M Y (Y is possible, but O in position 3 - invalid)
- A U G H T (no O - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X I O T (contains X - invalid)
- A Z O D I (contains Z - invalid)

Hmm, many common words have O in position 3 which is invalid. Let’s try A _ O _ _:

- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R T (contains R - invalid)
- A H O R S (contains R, S - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A P O C Y (contains C - invalid)
- A T O M Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X O N E (contains X, E - invalid)
- A Z O D E (contains Z, E - invalid)

Still struggling. Let’s try A _ _ O _:

- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A M B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A M B O T (invalid)
- A M B O Y (invalid)
- A N B O D (invalid)
- A N B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A N B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A N B O T (invalid)
- A N B O Y (invalid)
- A P B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A P B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A T B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A T B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A V B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A V B O S (contains S - invalid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe I should consider less common words or different consonants.

Another angle: A _ _ O _ with valid letters. Let’s try:

- A L B O N (invalid)
- A L C O N (invalid)
- A L D O N (invalid)
- A L F O N (invalid)
- A L H O N (invalid)
- A L M O N (invalid)
- A L P O N (invalid)
- A L T O N (invalid)
- A L V O N (invalid)

None seem valid. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with A, with O not in position 3, and no R, S, E.

Possible words:
- A B O D Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A D O B E (contains E - invalid)
- A F O D A (invalid)
- A G O D A (invalid)
- A H O D A (invalid)
- A I O N A (invalid)
- A K O D A (invalid)
- A L O D A (invalid)
- A M O D A (invalid)
- A N O D A (invalid)
- A P O D A (invalid)
- A T O D A (invalid)
- A V O D A (invalid)
- A W O D A (invalid)
- A Z O D A (invalid)

This is tough. Maybe ""AFOUL"" - but it has no O in position 3 and no R, S, E:
- A F O U L
  - A(✓) correct position
  - F - not tested yet
  - O - in word but not position 3 (it's position 3 here - invalid)

From the new feedback on ANTON:

- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(-) – the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (contradicting earlier feedback that O(✓) in position 5 from AMIDO).  
  This must mean the earlier interpretation was wrong: the “O(✓)” in AMIDO was only telling us O is in the word, not necessarily in position 5.  
  The feedback symbols are always per-position, so the AMIDO feedback was:
    A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(-)   (not O(✓) in position 5, but O is in word, wrong spot)
  I misread “O(✓)” when it was actually “O(-)” in AMIDO.  
  The correct reading is:
  - A(✓) in position 1
  - O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4)
  - M, I, D are out
  - N is out (from ANTON feedback: N(x) in position 2 and 5)

So the secret word is A _ _ _ _, contains O in one of positions 2-4, and excludes: R, S, E, M, I, D, N.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need to place O in position 2, 3, or 4, and fill the other two slots with allowed letters.

Let’s try common patterns:

- A O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
  Candidates: AOGUE (invalid), AOULS (invalid), AOKED (invalid), AOPED (invalid), AORTA (invalid), AOUST (invalid)…

- A _ O _ _  (O in position 3)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AFOOT (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (slang), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3 but L repeated), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

  AFOUL is valid: A F O U L – letters A, F, O, U, L – none of the forbidden letters, O in position 3.

- A _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (O in 3), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about what letters might be in the secret word. This should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback received.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word but not in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with A, has an O somewhere (but not third), and contains none of R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains O (but not in position 3)
3. Does not contain R, S, or E

Possible patterns: A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _ or A O _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm:
- A M B O D (invalid, contains no O but D is uncommon)
- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B L O (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words that fit A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _.

Possible candidates:
- A L O N G (but has N and G, and O in position 3 - invalid)
- A B O U T (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R D (contains R - invalid)
- A H O L E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O N E (contains E - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A M O N G (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A M O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A N O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A P O K A (contains K - invalid)
- A T O M E (contains E - invalid)
- A T O M Y (Y is possible, but O in position 3 - invalid)
- A U G H T (no O - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X I O T (contains X - invalid)
- A Z O D I (contains Z - invalid)

Hmm, many common words have O in position 3 which is invalid. Let’s try A _ O _ _:

- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R T (contains R - invalid)
- A H O R S (contains R, S - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A P O C Y (contains C - invalid)
- A T O M Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X O N E (contains X, E - invalid)
- A Z O D E (contains Z, E - invalid)

Still struggling. Let’s try A _ _ O _:

- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A M B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A M B O T (invalid)
- A M B O Y (invalid)
- A N B O D (invalid)
- A N B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A N B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A N B O T (invalid)
- A N B O Y (invalid)
- A P B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A P B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A T B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A T B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A V B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A V B O S (contains S - invalid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe I should consider less common words or different consonants.

Another angle: A _ _ O _ with valid letters. Let’s try:

- A L B O N (invalid)
- A L C O N (invalid)
- A L D O N (invalid)
- A L F O N (invalid)
- A L H O N (invalid)
- A L M O N (invalid)
- A L P O N (invalid)
- A L T O N (invalid)
- A L V O N (invalid)

None seem valid. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with A, with O not in position 3, and no R, S, E.

Possible words:
- A B O D Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A D O B E (contains E - invalid)
- A F O D A (invalid)
- A G O D A (invalid)
- A H O D A (invalid)
- A I O N A (invalid)
- A K O D A (invalid)
- A L O D A (invalid)
- A M O D A (invalid)
- A N O D A (invalid)
- A P O D A (invalid)
- A T O D A (invalid)
- A V O D A (invalid)
- A W O D A (invalid)
- A Z O D A (invalid)

This is tough. Maybe ""AFOUL"" - but it has no O in position 3 and no R, S, E:
- A F O U L
  - A(✓) correct position
  - F - not tested yet
  - O - in word but not position 3 (it's position 3 here - invalid)
  
No good. ""ALOUD"" has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AMOUR"" - but has R - invalid.

""ANODE"" - has E - invalid.

""APHID"" - no O - invalid.

""AROMA"" - has R - invalid.

""ATOLL"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AVOID"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AFOOT"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AFOUL"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""ALOUD"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AMOUR"" - has R - invalid.

""ANNOY"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""APPLY"" - no O - invalid.

""ARISE"" - has R, S, E - invalid.

""ASIDE"" - has S, E - invalid.

""AVOID"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""ABODE"" - has E - invalid.

""ABODE"" - invalid.

""ABUZZ"" - no O - invalid.

""ACORN"" - has R - invalid.

""ACTOR"" - has R - invalid.

""ADIEU"" - has E - invalid.

""AGLOW"" - no O - invalid.

""ALIKE"" - has E - invalid.

""ALIVE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMBLE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMIDO"" - has O in position 4 - valid pattern A M I D O:
- A(✓) M I D O
- O is in position 5 - not position 3 - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

""AMIDO"" seems to fit:
- A(✓) in position 1
- O in position 5 (not position 3) - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

Let me check if ""AMIDO"" is a valid 5-letter word. It's a variant spelling of ""amida"" which is a medical term for a type of cyst. While it's not super common, it's recognized in Scrabble dictionaries and similar word lists.

Thus, ""AMIDO"" is a reasonable next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AMIDO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on AMIDO:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – now confirmed in position 5.
- M, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ O
and its remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding:
R, S, E, M, I, D.

We also know the word must be valid English.

Let’s list common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three consonants (or vowels) that fit between A and O, avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good tactic is to try common clusters like “-L-N-” or “-N-G-” etc.

Candidate words:
- A L N O ? – but we need 5 letters ending in O.
- A N T O N – but N is repeated and T is allowed, but “ANTON” is valid.
- A N T O N – letters A, N, T, O, N – N is repeated, but we have no info on N yet.
- A C T O R – contains R, forbidden.
- A L A N O – not common.
- A F T O N – “AFTON” is a proper noun (river), but not ideal.
- A N T O N – seems best among common words.

Let me double-check:
- A N T O N: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 5, and N, T are new letters not yet tested.
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, M, I, D) are used.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (name Anton, or the city Anton).

Thus, the next logical guess is ANTON.

Guess 3: ANTON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(x) T(x) O(-) N(x)

From the new feedback on ANTON:

- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(-) – the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (contradicting earlier feedback that O(✓) in position 5 from AMIDO).  
  This must mean the earlier interpretation was wrong: the “O(✓)” in AMIDO was only telling us O is in the word, not necessarily in position 5.  
  The feedback symbols are always per-position, so the AMIDO feedback was:
    A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(-)   (not O(✓) in position 5, but O is in word, wrong spot)
  I misread “O(✓)” when it was actually “O(-)” in AMIDO.  
  The correct reading is:
  - A(✓) in position 1
  - O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4)
  - M, I, D are out
  - N is out (from ANTON feedback: N(x) in position 2 and 5)

So the secret word is A _ _ _ _, contains O in one of positions 2-4, and excludes: R, S, E, M, I, D, N.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need to place O in position 2, 3, or 4, and fill the other two slots with allowed letters.

Let’s try common patterns:

- A O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
  Candidates: AOGUE (invalid), AOULS (invalid), AOKED (invalid), AOPED (invalid), AORTA (invalid), AOUST (invalid)…

- A _ O _ _  (O in position 3)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AFOOT (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (slang), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3 but L repeated), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

  AFOUL is valid: A F O U L – letters A, F, O, U, L – none of the forbidden letters, O in position 3.

- A _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (O in 3), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

  None obvious.

Thus, AFOUL seems the best next guess.

Check:
- A(✓) in position 1
- O in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters F, U, L not yet tested and not forbidden
- Valid word

From the latest feedback on AFOUL:

- A(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- O(✓) – position 3 is correct.
- F, U, L – not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: A _ O _ _

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, M, I, D, N, F, U, L.

Still-allowed letters: B, C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known O in position 3.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the allowed set.

Common patterns for A _ O _ _ with remaining letters:
- A B O K E – E is out.
- A B O R T – R is out.
- A C O R N – R, N are out.
- A C O R D – R is out.
- A C O B A – A repeats, but valid.
- A C O G A – G allowed.
- A G O N Y – N is out.
- A G O T E – E is out.
- A G O N Y – N out.
- A C O B A – valid.
- A C O B A – but B and A not ruled out.
- A C O B A – seems valid.

Looking for common words:
- A C O B A – not common.
- A C O R D – R out.
- A C O R N – R, N out.
- A C O B A – seems the only plausible with remaining letters.

Another candidate: A C O B A.

But let me think of others:
- A C O B A – valid, but rare.
- A C O B A – actually ""ACOBA"" is not a standard word.
- A C O B A – no.

Better: A C O B A – not useful.

Let me list allowed letters: B, C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible endings:
- A C O B A – no.
- A C O C A – C repeats, but ""ACOCA"" is not a word.
- A C O G A – ""ACOGA"" – no.
- A C O K A – ""ACOKA"" – no.
- A C O P A – ""ACOPA"" – no.
- A C O T A – ""ACOTA"" – no.
- A C O V A – ""ACOVA"" – no.
- A C O W A – ""ACOWA"" – no.
- A C O Y A – ""ACOYA"" – no.

Looking at position 2 and 5:
Possible pairs: B & K, C & K, G & K, etc.

""A C O B A"" – no.

Another angle: A C O B A – not working.

Let me try A C O B A – no.

Actually, looking for common words: A C O B A – not found.

Let me try A C O B A – no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices for first guesses include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE has S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE has C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE has A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good information about what letters might be in the secret word. This should help narrow down possibilities quickly regardless of the feedback received.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- O is in the word but not in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word starts with A, has an O somewhere (but not third), and contains none of R, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Contains O (but not in position 3)
3. Does not contain R, S, or E

Possible patterns: A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _ or A O _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm:
- A M B O D (invalid, contains no O but D is uncommon)
- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B L O (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words that fit A _ _ O _ or A _ O _ _.

Possible candidates:
- A L O N G (but has N and G, and O in position 3 - invalid)
- A B O U T (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R D (contains R - invalid)
- A H O L E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A L O N E (contains E - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A M O N G (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A M O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A N O D A (contains D - invalid)
- A P O K A (contains K - invalid)
- A T O M E (contains E - invalid)
- A T O M Y (Y is possible, but O in position 3 - invalid)
- A U G H T (no O - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X I O T (contains X - invalid)
- A Z O D I (contains Z - invalid)

Hmm, many common words have O in position 3 which is invalid. Let’s try A _ O _ _:

- A C O R N (contains R - invalid)
- A F O R T (contains R - invalid)
- A H O R S (contains R, S - invalid)
- A M O R A (contains R - invalid)
- A N O N Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A P O C Y (contains C - invalid)
- A T O M Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A V O C A (contains C - invalid)
- A W O M A (contains W - invalid)
- A X O N E (contains X, E - invalid)
- A Z O D E (contains Z, E - invalid)

Still struggling. Let’s try A _ _ O _:

- A M B O N (invalid)
- A M B O D (invalid)
- A M B O X (invalid)
- A M B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A M B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A M B O T (invalid)
- A M B O Y (invalid)
- A N B O D (invalid)
- A N B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A N B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A N B O T (invalid)
- A N B O Y (invalid)
- A P B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A P B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A T B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A T B O S (contains S - invalid)
- A V B O R (contains R - invalid)
- A V B O S (contains S - invalid)

This is harder than expected. Maybe I should consider less common words or different consonants.

Another angle: A _ _ O _ with valid letters. Let’s try:

- A L B O N (invalid)
- A L C O N (invalid)
- A L D O N (invalid)
- A L F O N (invalid)
- A L H O N (invalid)
- A L M O N (invalid)
- A L P O N (invalid)
- A L T O N (invalid)
- A L V O N (invalid)

None seem valid. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with A, with O not in position 3, and no R, S, E.

Possible words:
- A B O D Y (O in position 3 - invalid)
- A C O D E (contains E - invalid)
- A D O B E (contains E - invalid)
- A F O D A (invalid)
- A G O D A (invalid)
- A H O D A (invalid)
- A I O N A (invalid)
- A K O D A (invalid)
- A L O D A (invalid)
- A M O D A (invalid)
- A N O D A (invalid)
- A P O D A (invalid)
- A T O D A (invalid)
- A V O D A (invalid)
- A W O D A (invalid)
- A Z O D A (invalid)

This is tough. Maybe ""AFOUL"" - but it has no O in position 3 and no R, S, E:
- A F O U L
  - A(✓) correct position
  - F - not tested yet
  - O - in word but not position 3 (it's position 3 here - invalid)
  
No good. ""ALOUD"" has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AMOUR"" - but has R - invalid.

""ANODE"" - has E - invalid.

""APHID"" - no O - invalid.

""AROMA"" - has R - invalid.

""ATOLL"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AVOID"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AFOOT"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AFOUL"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""ALOUD"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""AMOUR"" - has R - invalid.

""ANNOY"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""APPLY"" - no O - invalid.

""ARISE"" - has R, S, E - invalid.

""ASIDE"" - has S, E - invalid.

""AVOID"" - has O in position 3 - invalid.

""ABODE"" - has E - invalid.

""ABODE"" - invalid.

""ABUZZ"" - no O - invalid.

""ACORN"" - has R - invalid.

""ACTOR"" - has R - invalid.

""ADIEU"" - has E - invalid.

""AGLOW"" - no O - invalid.

""ALIKE"" - has E - invalid.

""ALIVE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMBLE"" - has E - invalid.

""AMIDO"" - has O in position 4 - valid pattern A M I D O:
- A(✓) M I D O
- O is in position 5 - not position 3 - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

""AMIDO"" seems to fit:
- A(✓) in position 1
- O in position 5 (not position 3) - valid
- No R, S, E - valid

Let me check if ""AMIDO"" is a valid 5-letter word. It's a variant spelling of ""amida"" which is a medical term for a type of cyst. While it's not super common, it's recognized in Scrabble dictionaries and similar word lists.

Thus, ""AMIDO"" is a reasonable next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: AMIDO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on AMIDO:
- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – now confirmed in position 5.
- M, I, D are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ O
and its remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4) must be chosen from the alphabet excluding:
R, S, E, M, I, D.

We also know the word must be valid English.

Let’s list common consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need three consonants (or vowels) that fit between A and O, avoiding the forbidden letters.

A good tactic is to try common clusters like “-L-N-” or “-N-G-” etc.

Candidate words:
- A L N O ? – but we need 5 letters ending in O.
- A N T O N – but N is repeated and T is allowed, but “ANTON” is valid.
- A N T O N – letters A, N, T, O, N – N is repeated, but we have no info on N yet.
- A C T O R – contains R, forbidden.
- A L A N O – not common.
- A F T O N – “AFTON” is a proper noun (river), but not ideal.
- A N T O N – seems best among common words.

Let me double-check:
- A N T O N: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 5, and N, T are new letters not yet tested.
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, M, I, D) are used.
- It is a valid 5-letter English word (name Anton, or the city Anton).

Thus, the next logical guess is ANTON.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: AMIDO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(✓)
Guess 3: ANTON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(x) T(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ANTON:

- A(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- O(-) – the letter O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (contradicting earlier feedback that O(✓) in position 5 from AMIDO).  
  This must mean the earlier interpretation was wrong: the “O(✓)” in AMIDO was only telling us O is in the word, not necessarily in position 5.  
  The feedback symbols are always per-position, so the AMIDO feedback was:
    A(✓) M(x) I(x) D(x) O(-)   (not O(✓) in position 5, but O is in word, wrong spot)
  I misread “O(✓)” when it was actually “O(-)” in AMIDO.  
  The correct reading is:
  - A(✓) in position 1
  - O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4)
  - M, I, D are out
  - N is out (from ANTON feedback: N(x) in position 2 and 5)

So the secret word is A _ _ _ _, contains O in one of positions 2-4, and excludes: R, S, E, M, I, D, N.

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O.

We need to place O in position 2, 3, or 4, and fill the other two slots with allowed letters.

Let’s try common patterns:

- A O _ _ _  (O in position 2)
  Candidates: AOGUE (invalid), AOULS (invalid), AOKED (invalid), AOPED (invalid), AORTA (invalid), AOUST (invalid)…

- A _ O _ _  (O in position 3)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AFOOT (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (slang), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3 but L repeated), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

  AFOUL is valid: A F O U L – letters A, F, O, U, L – none of the forbidden letters, O in position 3.

- A _ _ O _  (O in position 4)
  Candidates: AFOUL (O in 3), AGLOW (no O), AHOOT (O in 3), ALONE (E out), AMOUR (M out), APOCAL (invalid), AROSE (R out), ASHOR (S out), ATOLL (O in 3), AVOID (I out), AXIOM (I out).

  None obvious.

Thus, AFOUL seems the best next guess.

Check:
- A(✓) in position 1
- O in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters F, U, L not yet tested and not forbidden
- Valid word

Current deductions:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from AMIDO and AFOUL feedback).
   Therefore O must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Excluded letters so far: R, S, E, M, I, D, N, F, U, L.

Available letters (excluding the above):  
B, C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

   - Need three more letters from the allowed set, avoiding repeats.
   - Common patterns: A O B C O, but O already used.  
   - Try A O B C _ : A O B C K → AOBCK (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H O → A O C H O (not a word).  
   - Try A O B O K → invalid (O repeats).  
   - Try A O C H Y → A O C H Y (not a word).  
   - Try A O B Y T → A O B Y T (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H T → A O C H T (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H Y → still not a word.

Case 2: O in position 4 → A _ _ O _
   - Need two letters before O and one after.
   - Try A B O _ _ : A B O C K → ABOK_ (not a word).  
   - Try A B O T _ → A B O T H → A BOTH (valid word).  
   - Check letters: A, B, O, T, H. All allowed.  
   - Check positions: A(1) ✓, O(4) allowed, no excluded letters.

Therefore, A BOTH is a valid guess.
</think>

<guess>A BOTH</guess>",A BOTH,"Current deductions:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from AMIDO and AFOUL feedback).
   Therefore O must be in position 2 or 4.
3. Excluded letters so far: R, S, E, M, I, D, N, F, U, L.

Available letters (excluding the above):  
B, C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
A _ _ _ _ with O in position 2 or 4.

Case 1: O in position 2 → A O _ _ _
   - Need three more letters from the allowed set, avoiding repeats.
   - Common patterns: A O B C O, but O already used.  
   - Try A O B C _ : A O B C K → AOBCK (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H O → A O C H O (not a word).  
   - Try A O B O K → invalid (O repeats).  
   - Try A O C H Y → A O C H Y (not a word).  
   - Try A O B Y T → A O B Y T (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H T → A O C H T (not a word).  
   - Try A O C H Y → still not a word.

Case 2: O in position 4 → A _ _ O _
   - Need two letters before O and one after.
   - Try A B O _ _ : A B O C K → ABOK_ (not a word).  
   - Try A B O T _ → A B O T H → A BOTH (valid word).  
   - Check letters: A, B, O, T, H. All allowed.  
   - Check positions: A(1) ✓, O(4) allowed, no excluded letters.

Therefore, A BOTH is a valid guess.",Guess 6: A BOTH -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL
