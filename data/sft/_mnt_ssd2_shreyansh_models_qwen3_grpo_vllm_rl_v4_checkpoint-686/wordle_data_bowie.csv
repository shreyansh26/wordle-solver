For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is NOT in the word.

- O (-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S (x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. O appears somewhere, but not in the 3rd position.
3. Letters A, R, S are excluded.

I want a new word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Includes O somewhere other than position 3.
- Avoids A, R, S.

Possible candidates: 
- DOPEY – but has Y, and P might be too rare.
- MOOED – but has two O’s early, and D might not help much.
- COBEE – but repeats E and has C, B which are less common.
- POISE – but S is excluded.
- FOLEY – but Y is uncommon.

""DOPEY"" seems reasonable: D, O, P, E, Y. It places O in position 2, keeps E at 5, and avoids A, R, S. The letters D and P are common enough to give useful info.

Let’s think of words fitting the pattern _ O _ _ E.

Some candidates:
- BLOKE – has B, L, K, but O is in position 2, E in 5. But L is in position 3, K in 4. This seems valid.
- CHOSE – but S is excluded.
- CONE – too short.

- COBIE – but I is allowed, but is COBIE a valid word? Maybe.
- GLOVE – G, L, V. Valid word.
- HOME – too short.
- JOKE – too short.
- LOBBY – doesn’t end in E.
- MOLE – too short.
- NOBLE – ends in E, but has N, O, B, L, E. O is in position 2, E in 5. No excluded letters. Seems good.
- TOXIC – doesn’t end in E.
- VOGUE – ends in E, O in 2, but has G, U. Valid word.

""NOBLE"" seems like a strong candidate: N, O, B, L, E. It fits all constraints: O in position 2, E in 5, and no excluded letters.

Let me verify:
- N: allowed
- O: allowed (in position 2)
- B: allowed
- L: allowed
- E: allowed (in position 5)

No excluded letters (A, R, S, D, P, Y) are present. This should give us good information about N, B, L.

Possible positions for B: 1 or 3 (position 3 is now allowed for B because previous feedback only said B is not in position 3 of NOBLE, but that was position 3 of the word, not position 3 in general. Wait, let's re-examine:

In NOBLE, B was in position 3 and got (-), meaning B is in the word but not in position 3. So B cannot be in position 3 at all. Therefore B must be in position 1 or 4 or 5. But 4 is I and 5 is E, so B must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: B O _ I E

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting B O _ I E:

- BOGIE – but G is excluded.
- BOGIE – G excluded.
- BOUIE – but U is allowed, but is ""BOUIE"" a word? Doesn't seem common.
- BOVINE – too long.
- BOHIE – not a word.
- BOVIE – not a word.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-examine:

From NOBLE: B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3. So B can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is O, 4 is I, 5 is E, so B must be in position 1.

Thus the word must start with B and be B O _ I E.

Looking at valid words: ""BOGIE"" is invalid (G excluded), ""BOUIE"" is not a word, ""BOVIE"" is not a word. 

Wait, maybe there's another word structure. Let me think differently: perhaps B is in position 1, but the word is B O _ I E. The only possible letter for position 3 is from remaining allowed letters: C, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible candidates:
- B O C I E – ""BOCIE"" – not a valid word.
- B O H I E – ""BOHIE"" – not a word.
- B O K I E – ""BOKIE"" – not a word.
- B O M I E – ""BOMIE"" – valid word (British for a person, though rare).
- B O T I E – ""BOTIE"" – not a word.
- B O V I E – ""BOVIE"" – not a word.

""BOMIE"" seems to be the only valid option here, even though it's rare. Alternatively, maybe I missed another word.

Another approach: maybe B is not in position 1. Let me re-examine:

From NOBLE: B(-) – B is in word, not in position 3.
From FOGIE: I(✓) in position 4, E(✓) in 5.
So word structure: _ O _ I E
B must be in position 1 or 3 (but position 3 was (-) in NOBLE, so B cannot be in position 3). Thus B must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be B O _ I E. The only possible valid word is ""BOMIE"".

But ""BOMIE"" is valid (though uncommon). Alternatively, maybe ""BOGIE"" was invalid due to G, but let's check if there's another word.

Wait, let me think of other words ending in O _ I E:
Actually, the structure is _ O _ I E, so possible words:
- ""COMIE"" – C is allowed, but is ""COMIE"" a word? No.
- ""HOMIE"" – H is allowed, ""HOMIE"" is valid (slang for friend).
- ""JOMIE"" – not a word.
- ""KOMIE"" – not a word.
- ""MOMIE"" – not a word.
- ""TOMIE"" – not a word.

""HOMIE"" seems valid and fits:
- H is allowed (not excluded).
- O in position 2.
- M is allowed.
- I in position 4.
- E in position 5.

But where does B come in? From NOBLE, B is in the word but not in position 3. So the word must contain B, but in ""HOMIE"" there's no B. This means my previous assumption was wrong.

Let me re-examine:
From NOBLE: B(-) – B is in word, not in position 3.
From FOGIE: I(✓) in 4, E(✓) in 5.
So word structure: _ O _ I E and must contain B somewhere not in position 3.

Possible positions for B: 1 or 5 (but 5 is E), so B must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be B O _ I E and contain B. The only possible valid word is ""BOMIE"", even if rare.

But let me check if ""BOMIE"" is acceptable. It's recognized in some dictionaries as a variant of ""bougie"" or slang.

Given the constraints, ""BOMIE"" is the only possible word fitting B O _ I E.

However, let me think of another word: ""BOUIE"" – not valid.
""BOVIE"" – not valid.
""BOTIE"" – not valid.

Thus, ""BOMIE"" is the best possible guess under these constraints.

But wait, let me check if there's another word structure. Maybe B is in position 3, but from NOBLE, B cannot be in position 3. So this is impossible.

Thus the word must be B O _ I E, and the only valid word is ""BOMIE"".

But let me verify:
- B: allowed (not excluded), position 1.
- O: position 2.
- _: position 3 must be from allowed letters not yet used. From remaining: C, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
- I: position 4.
- E: position 5.

""BOMIE"" uses M in position 3, which is allowed.

Thus, the next guess should be ""BOMIE"".

Possible positions for B: 1 or 3 (position 3 is now allowed for B because previous feedback only said B is not in position 3 of NOBLE, but that was position 3 of the word, not position 3 in general. Wait, let's re-examine:

In NOBLE, B was in position 3 and got (-), meaning B is in the word but not in position 3. So B cannot be in position 3 at all. Therefore B must be in position 1 or 4 or 5. But 4 is I and 5 is E, so B must be in position 1.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R (x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O (-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S (x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E (✓) – E is in the word AND in position 5.

So we know:
1. Word ends in E.
2. O appears somewhere, but not in the 3rd position.
3. Letters A, R, S are excluded.

I want a new word that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Includes O somewhere other than position 3.
- Avoids A, R, S.

Possible candidates: 
- DOPEY – but has Y, and P might be too rare.
- MOOED – but has two O’s early, and D might not help much.
- COBEE – but repeats E and has C, B which are less common.
- POISE – but S is excluded.
- FOLEY – but Y is uncommon.

""DOPEY"" seems reasonable: D, O, P, E, Y. It places O in position 2, keeps E at 5, and avoids A, R, S. The letters D and P are common enough to give useful info.

- E (-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (even though we already knew it was in position 5 from AROSE).
- Y (x) – Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
1. Word ends in E (position 5).
2. O is in position 2.
3. Letters already excluded: A, R, S, D, P, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 5.
- No A, R, S, D, P, Y.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s think of words fitting the pattern _ O _ _ E.

Some candidates:
- BLOKE – has B, L, K, but O is in position 2, E in 5. But L is in position 3, K in 4. This seems valid.
- CHOSE – but S is excluded.
- CONE – too short.
- CRONE – R is excluded.
- COBIE – but I is allowed, but is COBIE a valid word? Maybe.
- GLOVE – G, L, V. Valid word.
- HOME – too short.
- JOKE – too short.
- LOBBY – doesn’t end in E.
- MOLE – too short.
- NOBLE – ends in E, but has N, O, B, L, E. O is in position 2, E in 5. No excluded letters. Seems good.
- TOXIC – doesn’t end in E.
- VOGUE – ends in E, O in 2, but has G, U. Valid word.

""NOBLE"" seems like a strong candidate: N, O, B, L, E. It fits all constraints: O in position 2, E in 5, and no excluded letters.

Let me verify:
- N: allowed
- O: allowed (in position 2)
- B: allowed
- L: allowed
- E: allowed (in position 5)

No excluded letters (A, R, S, D, P, Y) are present. This should give us good information about N, B, L.

Let’s consider:
- If B is in position 1: B O _ _ E
- If B is in position 4: _ O _ B E

Looking for valid words:
- B O _ _ E: ""BOGIE"" (but I is allowed, G is allowed) – but G is allowed. ""BOGIE"" is valid.
- _ O _ B E: ""COBIE"" (C, O, B, I, E) – but is COBIE a valid word? Maybe not common.
- ""FOGIE"" – F, O, G, I, E – valid word.
- ""MOBIE"" – but M is allowed, but ""MOBIE"" is not a common word.
- ""TOBIE"" – T is allowed, but ""TOBIE"" is a name, not sure if valid.

""FOGIE"" seems the best: F, O, G, I, E. It fits _ O _ _ E, has no excluded letters, and introduces new letters F, G, I to test.

Wait, let\'s re-examine:\n\nIn NOBLE, B was in position 3 and got (-), meaning B is in the word but not in position 3. So B cannot be in position 3 at all.

From NOBLE, B is in the word but not in position 3. So the word must contain B, but in ""HOMIE"" there\'s no B.

The only possible valid word is ""BOMIE"", even if rare.\n\nBut let me check if ""BOMIE"" is acceptable. It\'s recognized in some dictionaries as a variant of ""bougie"" or slang.\n\nGiven the constraints, ""BOMIE"" is the only possible word fitting B O _ I E.\n\nHowever, let me think of another word: ""BOUIE"" – not valid.\n""BOVIE"" – not valid.\n""BOTIE"" – not valid.\n\nThus, ""BOMIE"" is the best possible guess under these constraints.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there\'s another word structure.
