### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
O, H, I

Positions we have ruled out for each of those letters:

- O cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- H cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- I cannot be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ _ with the constraints:
- O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4.
- H must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.
- I must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

We still need to use only letters that have not been ruled out. Allowed letters so far:
B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, H, I which we already know are present).

Let’s try to place O, H, I together in positions 2-4 and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

One promising arrangement:
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I

That gives us: _ O H I _

Now we just need a first and last letter from the allowed set. Common consonants left: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s pick B for position 1 and Y for position 5: B O H I Y

Check validity: BOHIY is not a recognized English word.

Next try: C O H I _ – need a 5th letter. COHI_ – no common word.

Try positions 1,3,4,5 with I, O, H:
I _ _ O _ – but O can’t be in position 4 (never ruled out, but let’s see).

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = I
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

That gives I O H I _ – not valid.

Try H in position 2, O in position 4, I in position 1 or 3 or 5.

H _ O _ _ – need I somewhere. H I O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so this is invalid.

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = C
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

C O H I _ – again, need a 5th letter. COHIY is invalid.

Let’s try positions 1,2,3 with I, H, O:
I H O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Next idea: O in position 2, H in position 3, I in position 4 or 5.

_ O H _ I – but then we need a first letter. Let’s try C: C O H _ I – need a 4th letter. COH I _ – no.

Try L as first letter: L O H _ I – need a 4th letter. LOH I _ – no.

Try M: M O H _ I – same issue.

Let’s try O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _ – but then H and I must fit in positions 2-5 with constraints.

O _ H _ I – but O can’t be in position 1? No rule against it. Let’s check if this is valid.

O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Another arrangement:
O _ _ H I – but H can’t be in position 4 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Let’s try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _ – but from AROSE feedback, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, but then in DOUGH it was in position 4 and marked -, meaning O is NOT in position 4. So O cannot be in position 4. Thus O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But from HINTO feedback, O was in position 5 and marked -, so O cannot be in position 5. Therefore O must be in position 1 or 2.

Case 1: O in position 1
O _ _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 2-5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5 (already), so 2,3,4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5 (but 1 is O), so 3,4,5
- O is already in 1

Possible: O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

O _ H I _ – H in 3, I in 4 – valid positions. Need a 2nd letter. Allowed: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s try B: O B H I _ – need 5th letter. O B H I Y – is O B H I Y a word? No.

Try C: O C H I _ – same issue.

Try L: O L H I _ – no.

Try M: O M H I _ – no.

Try P: O P H I _ – no.

Try Y: O Y H I _ – no.

Case 2: O in position 2
_ O _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 1,3,4,5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5, so 3 or 4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5

Possible arrangements:
H O I _ _ – but H can’t be in 1, so invalid.
I O H _ _ – H in 3, valid. Need 4th and 5th letters. I O H _ _ – need two allowed consonants.

Let’s try O in position 3 – but from DOUGH feedback, O was in position 4 and marked -, so O cannot be in 4, and from AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, so O must be in position 3.

Wait! From AROSE feedback:
AROSE -> A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
This means O is in the word and in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _

Now we know:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- H and I must be in positions 1,2,4,5 with:
  - H not in 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback), so H must be in 2 or 4.
  - I not in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so I must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T.

Allowed letters: B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, H, I already placed.

Let’s list possible positions for H and I:

Case 1: H in position 2
Then pattern: _ H O _ _
I must be in 1,4, or 5.

Subcase 1a: I in 1
I H O _ _
Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed set. Possible: I H O B Y – no.

_ H O I _
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B H O I Y – no.

Subcase 1c: I in 5
_ H O _ I
Need 1st and 4th letters. Possible: B H O C I – no.

Case 2: H in position 4
Then pattern: _ _ O H _
I must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2, and 3 is O, 4 is H).

Subcase 2a: I in 1
I _ O H _
Need 2nd and 5th letters. Possible: I B O H Y – no.

Subcase 2b: I in 5
_ _ O H I
Need 1st and 2nd letters. Possible: B C O H I – no.

Let’s try concrete words with pattern _ _ O H I:
Need 1st and 2nd letters from allowed set: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Possible combinations:
B C O H I – no word.
B L O H I – no.
B M O H I – no.
B P O H I – no.
B Y O H I – no.
C L O H I – no.
C M O H I – no.

L P O H I – no.

C L O I H – no.
L M O I H – no.
M P O I H – no.
P Y O I H – no.

Let’s try pattern _ H O I _:
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B H O I Y – no.
C H O I Y – no.
L H O I Y – no.
M H O I Y – no.
P H O I Y – no.
Y H O I ? – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O H _:
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B I O H Y – no.
C I O H Y – no.
L I O H Y – no.
M I O H Y – no.
P I O H Y – no.

Let’s try pattern I _ O H _:

I C O H Y – no.
I L O H Y – no.
I M O H Y – no.
I P O H Y – no.
I Y O H ? – no.

Let’s try pattern I H O _ _:
Need 4th and 5th letters. Possible: I H O B Y – no.
I H O C Y – no.
I H O L Y – no.
I H O M Y – no.
I H O P Y – no.
I H O Y ? – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O H _ again with different letters.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains H and I somewhere.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words:
- BOCHI – no.
- COBHI – no.
- LOCHI – no.
- MOCHI – no.
- POCHI – no.
- YOCHI – no.
- BICH0 – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is ""CHOIR"" but R is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOKE"" – E is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOIL"" – L is allowed, but is this a word? Yes, ""choil"" is archaic but valid.

But let’s check:
C H O I L – positions:
C (allowed), H (must be in 2 or 4), O (fixed in 3), I (must be in 1,4,5), L (allowed).

Here:
H is in 2 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed), O in 3 (fixed), C in 1, L in 5.

This fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: C, H, O, I, L – none are forbidden.
- O is in position 3 (matches AROSE feedback).
- H is in position 2 (allowed, since H can be in 2 or 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, the word ""CHOIL"" seems valid.

<guess>CHOIL</guess>
</think>

<guess>CHOIL</guess>",CHOIL,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
O, H, I

Positions we have ruled out for each of those letters:

- O cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- H cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- I cannot be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ _ with the constraints:
- O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4.
- H must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.
- I must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

We still need to use only letters that have not been ruled out. Allowed letters so far:
B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, H, I which we already know are present).

Let’s try to place O, H, I together in positions 2-4 and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

One promising arrangement:
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I

That gives us: _ O H I _

Now we just need a first and last letter from the allowed set. Common consonants left: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s pick B for position 1 and Y for position 5: B O H I Y

Check validity: BOHIY is not a recognized English word.

Next try: C O H I _ – need a 5th letter. COHI_ – no common word.

Try positions 1,3,4,5 with I, O, H:
I _ _ O _ – but O can’t be in position 4 (never ruled out, but let’s see).

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = I
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

That gives I O H I _ – not valid.

Try H in position 2, O in position 4, I in position 1 or 3 or 5.

H _ O _ _ – need I somewhere. H I O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so this is invalid.

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = C
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

C O H I _ – again, need a 5th letter. COHIY is invalid.

Let’s try positions 1,2,3 with I, H, O:
I H O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Next idea: O in position 2, H in position 3, I in position 4 or 5.

_ O H _ I – but then we need a first letter. Let’s try C: C O H _ I – need a 4th letter. COH I _ – no.

Try L as first letter: L O H _ I – need a 4th letter. LOH I _ – no.

Try M: M O H _ I – same issue.

Let’s try O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _ – but then H and I must fit in positions 2-5 with constraints.

O _ H _ I – but O can’t be in position 1? No rule against it. Let’s check if this is valid.

O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Another arrangement:
O _ _ H I – but H can’t be in position 4 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Let’s try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _ – but from AROSE feedback, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, but then in DOUGH it was in position 4 and marked -, meaning O is NOT in position 4. So O cannot be in position 4. Thus O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But from HINTO feedback, O was in position 5 and marked -, so O cannot be in position 5. Therefore O must be in position 1 or 2.

Case 1: O in position 1
O _ _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 2-5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5 (already), so 2,3,4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5 (but 1 is O), so 3,4,5
- O is already in 1

Possible: O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

O _ H I _ – H in 3, I in 4 – valid positions. Need a 2nd letter. Allowed: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s try B: O B H I _ – need 5th letter. O B H I Y – is O B H I Y a word? No.

Try C: O C H I _ – same issue.

Try L: O L H I _ – no.

Try M: O M H I _ – no.

Try P: O P H I _ – no.

Try Y: O Y H I _ – no.

Case 2: O in position 2
_ O _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 1,3,4,5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5, so 3 or 4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5

Possible arrangements:
H O I _ _ – but H can’t be in 1, so invalid.
I O H _ _ – H in 3, valid. Need 4th and 5th letters. I O H _ _ – need two allowed consonants.

Let’s try I O H B Y – IOHBY – not a word.

Let’s try O in position 3 – but from DOUGH feedback, O was in position 4 and marked -, so O cannot be in 4, and from AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, so O must be in position 3.

Wait! From AROSE feedback:
AROSE -> A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
This means O is in the word and in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _

Now we know:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- H and I must be in positions 1,2,4,5 with:
  - H not in 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback), so H must be in 2 or 4.
  - I not in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so I must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T.

Allowed letters: B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, H, I already placed.

Let’s list possible positions for H and I:

Then pattern: _ H O _ _
I must be in 1,4, or 5.

I H O _ _
Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed set. Possible: I H O B Y – no.

Subcase 1b: I in 4

Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B H O I Y – no.

Subcase 1c: I in 5
_ H O _ I
Need 1st and 4th letters. Possible: B H O C I – no.

Case 2: H in position 4
Then pattern: _ _ O H _
I must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2, and 3 is O, 4 is H).

Subcase 2a: I in 1
I _ O H _
Need 2nd and 5th letters. Possible: I B O H Y – no.

Subcase 2b: I in 5
_ _ O H I
Need 1st and 2nd letters. Possible: B C O H I – no.

Let’s try concrete words with pattern _ _ O H I:
Need 1st and 2nd letters from allowed set: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Possible combinations:
B C O H I – no word.
B L O H I – no.
B M O H I – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O H _:

Let’s try pattern I _ O H _:

I H O C Y – no.
I H O L Y – no.
I H O M Y – no.
I H O P Y – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O H _ again with different letters.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains H and I somewhere.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words:
- BOCHI – no.
- COBHI – no.
- LOCHI – no.
- MOCHI – no.
- POCHI – no.
- YOCHI – no.
- BICH0 – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is ""CHOIR"" but R is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOKE"" – E is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOIL"" – L is allowed, but is this a word? Yes, ""choil"" is archaic but valid.

But let’s check:
C H O I L – positions:
C (allowed), H (must be in 2 or 4), O (fixed in 3), I (must be in 1,4,5), L (allowed).

Here:
H is in 2 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed), O in 3 (fixed), C in 1, L in 5.

This fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: C, H, O, I, L – none are forbidden.
- O is in position 3 (matches AROSE feedback).
- H is in position 2 (allowed, since H can be in 2 or 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, the word ""CHOIL"" seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the secret word.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This combination should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern _ _ _ O _ and does not contain A, R, S, or E.

Common letters still available: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 4th position.
2. Uses none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: DOUGH, COULD, MOUNT, POINT, CLOUD, etc.

""DOUGH"" looks good:
- D, O, U, G, H - none of the forbidden letters.
- Uses common letters D, U, G, H to test new possibilities.

Guess 2: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) U(x) G(x) H(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DOUGH:
- O is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (it was marked “-” instead of “✓”).
- D, U, G are not in the word at all.
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (it was marked “-”).

So far we know:
- The word does NOT contain: A, R, S, E, D, U, G.
- The word DOES contain: O and H.
- O is NOT in position 4.
- H is NOT in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O and H.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 4.
3. Uses none of the forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, D, U, G.
4. Places H somewhere other than position 5.

Available letters (common ones): T, N, I, L, C, Y, M, P, B, F, K, etc.

Let’s try to place O in position 2 and H in position 1 or 3, and fill the rest with allowed letters.

Candidate: HINTO
- H in position 1 (allowed).
- I, N, T, O all allowed.
- O in position 5 (allowed, since we only know O isn’t in position 4).

Another candidate: HINTO seems valid. Let’s check:
- H: allowed, position 1 (ok).
- I: allowed.
- N: allowed.
- T: allowed.
- O: allowed, position 5 (ok).

Let’s go with HINTO.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DOUGH -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(-) U(x) G(x) H(-)
Guess 3: HINTO -> FEEDBACK: H(-) I(-) N(x) T(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word (✓):
O, H, I

Positions we have ruled out for each of those letters:

- O cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- H cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback).
- I cannot be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback).

So the pattern looks like: _ _ _ _ _ with the constraints:
- O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4.
- H must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4.
- I must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

We still need to use only letters that have not been ruled out. Allowed letters so far:
B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, H, I which we already know are present).

Let’s try to place O, H, I together in positions 2-4 and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

One promising arrangement:
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I

That gives us: _ O H I _

Now we just need a first and last letter from the allowed set. Common consonants left: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s pick B for position 1 and Y for position 5: B O H I Y

Check validity: BOHIY is not a recognized English word.

Next try: C O H I _ – need a 5th letter. COHI_ – no common word.

Try positions 1,3,4,5 with I, O, H:
I _ _ O _ – but O can’t be in position 4 (never ruled out, but let’s see).

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = I
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

That gives I O H I _ – not valid.

Try H in position 2, O in position 4, I in position 1 or 3 or 5.

H _ O _ _ – need I somewhere. H I O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so this is invalid.

Another arrangement:
Position 1 = C
Position 2 = O
Position 3 = H
Position 4 = I
Position 5 = ?

C O H I _ – again, need a 5th letter. COHIY is invalid.

Let’s try positions 1,2,3 with I, H, O:
I H O _ _ – but O can’t be in position 3 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Next idea: O in position 2, H in position 3, I in position 4 or 5.

_ O H _ I – but then we need a first letter. Let’s try C: C O H _ I – need a 4th letter. COH I _ – no.

Try L as first letter: L O H _ I – need a 4th letter. LOH I _ – no.

Try M: M O H _ I – same issue.

Let’s try O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _ – but then H and I must fit in positions 2-5 with constraints.

O _ H _ I – but O can’t be in position 1? No rule against it. Let’s check if this is valid.

O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in position 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Another arrangement:
O _ _ H I – but H can’t be in position 4 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

Let’s try O in position 4:
_ _ _ O _ – but from AROSE feedback, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, but then in DOUGH it was in position 4 and marked -, meaning O is NOT in position 4. So O cannot be in position 4. Thus O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But from HINTO feedback, O was in position 5 and marked -, so O cannot be in position 5. Therefore O must be in position 1 or 2.

Case 1: O in position 1
O _ _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 2-5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5 (already), so 2,3,4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5 (but 1 is O), so 3,4,5
- O is already in 1

Possible: O H I _ _ – but H can’t be in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so invalid.

O _ H I _ – H in 3, I in 4 – valid positions. Need a 2nd letter. Allowed: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Let’s try B: O B H I _ – need 5th letter. O B H I Y – is O B H I Y a word? No.

Try C: O C H I _ – same issue.

Try L: O L H I _ – no.

Try M: O M H I _ – no.

Try P: O P H I _ – no.

Try Y: O Y H I _ – no.

Case 2: O in position 2
_ O _ _ _ – now H and I must be in positions 1,3,4,5 with:
- H not in 1 or 5, so 3 or 4
- I not in 2, so 1,3,4,5

Possible arrangements:
H O I _ _ – but H can’t be in 1, so invalid.
I O H _ _ – H in 3, valid. Need 4th and 5th letters. I O H _ _ – need two allowed consonants.

Let’s try I O H B Y – IOHBY – not a word.

Try I O H L Y – IOHLY – no.

Try I O H M Y – IOHMY – no.

Let’s try O in position 2, H in position 5 – but H can’t be in 5, so invalid.

Let’s try O in position 3 – but from DOUGH feedback, O was in position 4 and marked -, so O cannot be in 4, and from AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked ✓, so O must be in position 3.

Wait! From AROSE feedback:
AROSE -> A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
This means O is in the word and in position 3.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ _

Now we know:
- O is fixed in position 3.
- H and I must be in positions 1,2,4,5 with:
  - H not in 1 or 5 (from DOUGH and HINTO feedback), so H must be in 2 or 4.
  - I not in 2 (from HINTO feedback), so I must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T.

Allowed letters: B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, H, I already placed.

Let’s list possible positions for H and I:

Case 1: H in position 2
Then pattern: _ H O _ _
I must be in 1,4, or 5.

Subcase 1a: I in 1
I H O _ _
Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed set. Possible: I H O B Y – no.

Subcase 1b: I in 4
_ H O I _
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B H O I Y – no.

Subcase 1c: I in 5
_ H O _ I
Need 1st and 4th letters. Possible: B H O C I – no.

Case 2: H in position 4
Then pattern: _ _ O H _
I must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be in 2, and 3 is O, 4 is H).

Subcase 2a: I in 1
I _ O H _
Need 2nd and 5th letters. Possible: I B O H Y – no.

Subcase 2b: I in 5
_ _ O H I
Need 1st and 2nd letters. Possible: B C O H I – no.

Let’s try concrete words with pattern _ _ O H I:
Need 1st and 2nd letters from allowed set: B, C, L, M, P, Y.

Possible combinations:
B C O H I – no word.
B L O H I – no.
B M O H I – no.
B P O H I – no.
B Y O H I – no.
C L O H I – no.

C L O I H – no.
L M O I H – no.
M P O I H – no.
P Y O I H – no.

Let’s try pattern _ H O I _:
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B H O I Y – no.
C H O I Y – no.
L H O I Y – no.
M H O I Y – no.
P H O I Y – no.
Y H O I ? – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O H _:
Need 1st and 5th letters. Possible: B I O H Y – no.
C I O H Y – no.
L I O H Y – no.
M I O H Y – no.
P I O H Y – no.
Y I O H ? – no.

Let’s try pattern I _ O H _:
Need 2nd and 5th letters. Possible: I B O H Y – no.
I C O H Y – no.
I L O H Y – no.
I M O H Y – no.
I P O H Y – no.
I Y O H ? – no.

Let’s try pattern I H O _ _:
Need 4th and 5th letters. Possible: I H O B Y – no.
I H O C Y – no.
I H O L Y – no.
I H O M Y – no.
I H O P Y – no.
I H O Y ? – no.

Let’s try pattern _ I O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O _ H – but H can’t be in 5.

Let’s try pattern _ _ O H _ again with different letters.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains H and I somewhere.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible words:
- BOCHI – no.
- COBHI – no.
- LOCHI – no.
- MOCHI – no.
- POCHI – no.
- YOCHI – no.
- BICH0 – no.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is ""CHOIR"" but R is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOKE"" – E is forbidden.

""CHOIR"" – R is forbidden.

""CHOIL"" – L is allowed, but is this a word? Yes, ""choil"" is archaic but valid.

But let’s check:
C H O I L – positions:
C (allowed), H (must be in 2 or 4), O (fixed in 3), I (must be in 1,4,5), L (allowed).

Here:
H is in 2 (allowed), I is in 4 (allowed), O in 3 (fixed), C in 1, L in 5.

This fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: C, H, O, I, L – none are forbidden.
- O is in position 3 (matches AROSE feedback).
- H is in position 2 (allowed, since H can be in 2 or 4).
- I is in position 4 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, the word ""CHOIL"" seems valid.

From the latest feedback on CHOIL:
- C is correct in position 1.
- H is correct in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: C H O _ _
Letters we know are in the word: C, H, O, I, L
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, D, U, G, N, T (plus any others ruled out earlier)

Positions ruled out:
- I cannot be in position 4.
- L cannot be in position 5.

Possible remaining positions for I and L:
- I can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But positions 1,2,3 are already taken by C, H, O respectively, so I must be in position 5.
- L can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Positions 1,2,3 are taken by C, H, O respectively, so L must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: C H O L I
