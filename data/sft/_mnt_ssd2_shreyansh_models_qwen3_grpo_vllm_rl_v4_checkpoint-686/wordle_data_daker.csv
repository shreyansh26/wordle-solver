### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can provide valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, Y.

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains E and R somewhere else (positions 3 or 4 are still open for them, since 1 and 5 are ruled out for E, and 2 is taken by A).
- Does not contain O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E and R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but not in the positions already ruled out).
- Only letters from the remaining pool (no O, S, L, Y).

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (but A is already used in position 2, and we need to include E and R).

Let's try to place E and R in positions 3 and 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are out for E, and position 2 is A). We can try:
- E in position 3 and R in position 4: _ A E R _
- Or R in position 3 and E in position 4: _ A R E _

We need to fill the remaining slots with valid letters not yet ruled out. Let's try the first pattern: _ A E R _.

Possible first letters: common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W. Let's pick a common one like C or D.

Let's try ""C"" as the first letter: C A E R _. Now we need a fifth letter that isn't O, S, L, Y, and isn't A, E, R. Possible choices: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's pick ""D"" as the fifth letter: C A E R D. Is ""CAERD"" a valid word? No, that doesn't seem to be a valid English word.

Let's try ""M"" as the fifth letter: C A E R M. ""CAERM"" - no.

Let's try ""B"": C A E R B - no.

Let's try ""T"": C A E R T - ""CAERT"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": C A E R H - no.

Let's try ""N"": C A E R N - ""CAERN"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": C A E R K - no.

Let's try ""F"": C A E R F - no.

Let's try ""G"": C A E R G - no.

Let's try ""D"" again but as the first letter: D A E R _. ""DAER_"" - no.

Let's try ""BAKER"" - but that has K and E in position 4, but A is in position 2: B A K E R - but that has A in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. But R can't be in position 5 because in AROSE, R was in position 2 (feedback -) and in EARLY, R was in position 3 (feedback -), so R can't be in 2 or 3, but can be in 4 or 5. Similarly E can't be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Wait, let's re-examine positions:

From AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 5.

From EARLY:
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 1.
- A(✓) means A is in position 2.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in word.
- Y(x) means Y is not in word.

So:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1 or 5).
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 2 or 3).

So possible patterns:
1. _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
2. _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
3. _ A R E _  (R in 3 is invalid, so skip)
4. _ A _ R E  (E in 5 is invalid, so skip)

So only two valid patterns:
- _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)

Let's try the second pattern: _ A _ E R. We need a letter for position 3 that isn't O, S, L, Y, A, E, R. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: let's try B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T.

Let's try ""C"" in position 3: _ A C E R. The word would be ""C A C E R"" - ""CACER"" - no, that's not valid.

Let's try ""B"": B A _ E R. ""B A _ E R"" - ""BATER"" - no, T is allowed, but ""BATER"" isn't a word.

Let's try ""M"": M A _ E R - ""M A _ E R"" - ""MAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""N"": N A _ E R - ""N A _ E R"" - ""NAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""D"": D A _ E R - ""D A _ E R"" - ""DAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": K A _ E R - ""K A _ E R"" - ""KAVER"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": H A _ E R - ""HAVER"" - yes, ""HAVER"" is a valid word (meaning to shiver or a place to keep grain).

Let's check ""HAVER"":
- H: new letter, not tested.
- A: position 2 (✓).
- V: new letter, not tested.
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E can be in 3 or 4).
- R: position 5 (allowed, since R can be in 4 or 5).

This seems valid. Let's proceed with ""HAVER"".

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can provide valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (all in wrong positions so far).
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in slot 1.
- R is not in slot 2.
- E is not in slot 5.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A, R, E (since they must appear).
2. Avoids O and S.
3. Puts A, R, E in new positions to test their correct spots.
4. Adds new common letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Uses E, A, R in new positions (E in 1, A in 2, R in 3).
- Adds L and Y, which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids O and S.

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, Y.

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains E and R somewhere else (positions 3 or 4 are still open for them, since 1 and 5 are ruled out for E, and 2 is taken by A).
- Does not contain O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E and R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but not in the positions already ruled out).
- Only letters from the remaining pool (no O, S, L, Y).

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (but A is already used in position 2, and we need to include E and R).

Let's try to place E and R in positions 3 and 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are out for E, and position 2 is A). We can try:
- E in position 3 and R in position 4: _ A E R _
- Or R in position 3 and E in position 4: _ A R E _

We need to fill the remaining slots with valid letters not yet ruled out. Let's try the first pattern: _ A E R _.

Possible first letters: common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W. Let's pick a common one like C or D.

Let's try ""C"" as the first letter: C A E R _. Now we need a fifth letter that isn't O, S, L, Y, and isn't A, E, R. Possible choices: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's pick ""D"" as the fifth letter: C A E R D. Is ""CAERD"" a valid word? No, that doesn't seem to be a valid English word.

Let's try ""M"" as the fifth letter: C A E R M. ""CAERM"" - no.

Let's try ""B"": C A E R B - no.

Let's try ""T"": C A E R T - ""CAERT"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": C A E R H - no.

Let's try ""N"": C A E R N - ""CAERN"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": C A E R K - no.

Let's try ""F"": C A E R F - no.

Let's try ""G"": C A E R G - no.

Let's try ""D"" again but as the first letter: D A E R _. ""DAER_"" - no.

Let's try ""BAKER"" - but that has K and E in position 4, but A is in position 2: B A K E R - but that has A in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. But R can't be in position 5 because in AROSE, R was in position 2 (feedback -) and in EARLY, R was in position 3 (feedback -), so R can't be in 2 or 3, but can be in 4 or 5. Similarly E can't be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Wait, let's re-examine positions:

From AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 5.

From EARLY:
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 1.
- A(✓) means A is in position 2.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in word.
- Y(x) means Y is not in word.

So:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1 or 5).
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 2 or 3).

So possible patterns:
1. _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
2. _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
3. _ A R E _  (R in 3 is invalid, so skip)
4. _ A _ R E  (E in 5 is invalid, so skip)

So only two valid patterns:
- _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)

Let's try the second pattern: _ A _ E R. We need a letter for position 3 that isn't O, S, L, Y, A, E, R. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: let's try B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T.

Let's try ""C"" in position 3: _ A C E R. The word would be ""C A C E R"" - ""CACER"" - no, that's not valid.

Let's try ""B"": B A _ E R. ""B A _ E R"" - ""BATER"" - no, T is allowed, but ""BATER"" isn't a word.

Let's try ""M"": M A _ E R - ""M A _ E R"" - ""MAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""N"": N A _ E R - ""N A _ E R"" - ""NAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""D"": D A _ E R - ""D A _ E R"" - ""DAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": K A _ E R - ""K A _ E R"" - ""KAVER"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": H A _ E R - ""HAVER"" - yes, ""HAVER"" is a valid word (meaning to shiver or a place to keep grain).

Let's check ""HAVER"":
- H: new letter, not tested.
- A: position 2 (✓).
- V: new letter, not tested.
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E can be in 3 or 4).
- R: position 5 (allowed, since R can be in 4 or 5).

This seems valid. Let's proceed with ""HAVER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can provide valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Let's try ""BAKER"" - but that has K and E in position 4, but A is in position 2: B A K E R - but that has A in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. But R can't be in position 5 because in AROSE, R was in position 2 (feedback -) and in EARLY, R was in position 3 (feedback -), so R can't be in 2 or 3, but can be in 4 or 5. Similarly E can't be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Wait, let's re-examine positions:

From AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 5.

From EARLY:
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 1.
- A(✓) means A is in position 2.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in word.
- Y(x) means Y is not in word.

So:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1 or 5).
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 2 or 3).

So possible patterns:
1. _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
2. _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
3. _ A R E _  (R in 3 is invalid, so skip)
4. _ A _ R E  (E in 5 is invalid, so skip)

So only two valid patterns:
- _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)

Let's try the second pattern: _ A _ E R. We need a letter for position 3 that isn't O, S, L, Y, A, E, R. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: let's try B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T.

Let's try ""C"" in position 3: _ A C E R. The word would be ""C A C E R"" - ""CACER"" - no, that's not valid.

Let's try ""B"": B A _ E R. ""B A _ E R"" - ""BATER"" - no, T is allowed, but ""BATER"" isn't a word.

Let's try ""M"": M A _ E R - ""M A _ E R"" - ""MAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""N"": N A _ E R - ""N A _ E R"" - ""NAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""D"": D A _ E R - ""D A _ E R"" - ""DAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": K A _ E R - ""K A _ E R"" - ""KAVER"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": H A _ E R - ""HAVER"" - yes, ""HAVER"" is a valid word (meaning to shiver or a place to keep grain).

Let's check ""HAVER"":
- H: new letter, not tested.
- A: position 2 (✓).
- V: new letter, not tested.
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E can be in 3 or 4).
- R: position 5 (allowed, since R can be in 4 or 5).

This seems valid. Let's proceed with ""HAVER"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: HAVER -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters fixed:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY and HAVER).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from HAVER).
- R is in position 5 (✓ from HAVER).

Letters known NOT in the word:
O, S, L, Y, H, V.

So the word structure is: _ A _ E R.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Position 1: any letter except O, S, L, Y, H, V.
- Position 3: any letter except O, S, L, Y, H, V, A, E, R.

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z.
Possible letters for position 3: same list minus A, E, R.

Looking for common words: 
- B A _ E R → ""BAKER"" (but K is allowed)
- C A _ E R → ""CAFER"" (not common)
- D A _ E R → ""DAFER"" (no)
- F A _ E R → ""FAKER"" (valid)
- G A _ E R → ""GAVER"" (V is excluded)
- M A _ E R → ""MAKER"" (valid)
- N A _ E R → ""NAVER"" (V excluded)
- P A _ E R → ""PAPER"" (P is allowed, but E is already in position 4)
- T A _ E R → ""TAPER"" (valid)

The most common valid words are: BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, TAPER.

Let's pick ""MAKER"" as it's a common word.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can provide valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is NOT in the word.
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (all in wrong positions so far).
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- A is not in slot 1.
- R is not in slot 2.
- E is not in slot 5.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A, R, E (since they must appear).
2. Avoids O and S.
3. Puts A, R, E in new positions to test their correct spots.
4. Adds new common letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Uses E, A, R in new positions (E in 1, A in 2, R in 3).
- Adds L and Y, which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- Avoids O and S.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, Y.

So the secret word:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains E and R somewhere else (positions 3 or 4 are still open for them, since 1 and 5 are ruled out for E, and 2 is taken by A).
- Does not contain O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- E and R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but not in the positions already ruled out).
- Only letters from the remaining pool (no O, S, L, Y).

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (but A is already used in position 2, and we need to include E and R).

Let's try to place E and R in positions 3 and 4 (since positions 1 and 5 are out for E, and position 2 is A). We can try:
- E in position 3 and R in position 4: _ A E R _
- Or R in position 3 and E in position 4: _ A R E _

We need to fill the remaining slots with valid letters not yet ruled out. Let's try the first pattern: _ A E R _.

Possible first letters: common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W. Let's pick a common one like C or D.

Let's try ""C"" as the first letter: C A E R _. Now we need a fifth letter that isn't O, S, L, Y, and isn't A, E, R. Possible choices: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's pick ""D"" as the fifth letter: C A E R D. Is ""CAERD"" a valid word? No, that doesn't seem to be a valid English word.

Let's try ""M"" as the fifth letter: C A E R M. ""CAERM"" - no.

Let's try ""B"": C A E R B - no.

Let's try ""T"": C A E R T - ""CAERT"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": C A E R H - no.

Let's try ""N"": C A E R N - ""CAERN"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": C A E R K - no.

Let's try ""F"": C A E R F - no.

Let's try ""G"": C A E R G - no.

Let's try ""D"" again but as the first letter: D A E R _. ""DAER_"" - no.

Let's try ""BAKER"" - but that has K and E in position 4, but A is in position 2: B A K E R - but that has A in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. But R can't be in position 5 because in AROSE, R was in position 2 (feedback -) and in EARLY, R was in position 3 (feedback -), so R can't be in 2 or 3, but can be in 4 or 5. Similarly E can't be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 3 or 4.

Wait, let's re-examine positions:

From AROSE:
- A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 5.

From EARLY:
- E(-) means E is in word but not position 1.
- A(✓) means A is in position 2.
- R(-) means R is in word but not position 3.
- L(x) means L is not in word.
- Y(x) means Y is not in word.

So:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1 or 5).
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 2 or 3).

So possible patterns:
1. _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
2. _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)
3. _ A R E _  (R in 3 is invalid, so skip)
4. _ A _ R E  (E in 5 is invalid, so skip)

So only two valid patterns:
- _ A E R _  (E in 3, R in 4)
- _ A _ E R  (E in 4, R in 5)

Let's try the second pattern: _ A _ E R. We need a letter for position 3 that isn't O, S, L, Y, A, E, R. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common letters: let's try B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T.

Let's try ""C"" in position 3: _ A C E R. The word would be ""C A C E R"" - ""CACER"" - no, that's not valid.

Let's try ""B"": B A _ E R. ""B A _ E R"" - ""BATER"" - no, T is allowed, but ""BATER"" isn't a word.

Let's try ""M"": M A _ E R - ""M A _ E R"" - ""MAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""N"": N A _ E R - ""N A _ E R"" - ""NAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""D"": D A _ E R - ""D A _ E R"" - ""DAPER"" - no.

Let's try ""K"": K A _ E R - ""K A _ E R"" - ""KAVER"" - no.

Let's try ""H"": H A _ E R - ""HAVER"" - yes, ""HAVER"" is a valid word (meaning to shiver or a place to keep grain).

Let's check ""HAVER"":
- H: new letter, not tested.
- A: position 2 (✓).
- V: new letter, not tested.
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E can be in 3 or 4).
- R: position 5 (allowed, since R can be in 4 or 5).

This seems valid. Let's proceed with ""HAVER"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: HAVER -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters fixed:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY and HAVER).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from HAVER).
- R is in position 5 (✓ from HAVER).

Letters known NOT in the word:
O, S, L, Y, H, V.

So the word structure is: _ A _ E R.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- Position 1: any letter except O, S, L, Y, H, V.
- Position 3: any letter except O, S, L, Y, H, V, A, E, R.

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z.
Possible letters for position 3: same list minus A, E, R.

Looking for common words: 
- B A _ E R → ""BAKER"" (but K is allowed)
- C A _ E R → ""CAFER"" (not common)
- D A _ E R → ""DAFER"" (no)
- F A _ E R → ""FAKER"" (valid)
- G A _ E R → ""GAVER"" (V is excluded)
- M A _ E R → ""MAKER"" (valid)
- N A _ E R → ""NAVER"" (V excluded)
- P A _ E R → ""PAPER"" (P is allowed, but E is already in position 4)
- T A _ E R → ""TAPER"" (valid)

The most common valid words are: BAKER, FAKER, MAKER, TAPER.

Let's pick ""MAKER"" as it's a common word.

- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  
- Position 3 = K (✓)

So the pattern is: _ A K E R

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, L, Y, H, V, M.

Valid first-letter choices (common consonants not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z.
