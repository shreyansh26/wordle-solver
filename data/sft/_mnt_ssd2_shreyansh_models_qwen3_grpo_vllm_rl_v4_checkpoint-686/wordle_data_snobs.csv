### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or finding letters in the word. 

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

But let's check if there's a word without repeating S. ""SNOKS"" is valid (a type of fishing net), uses K and S. Again S is repeated.

Another option: ""SNOMA"" - but A is forbidden.

Valid words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or finding letters in the word. 

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is somewhere except the 4th position
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

I need a word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position
- Contains S (but not in 4th position)
- Does not contain A, R, E

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – S in 1st position, O in 3rd, no A/R/E
- SPOON (S, P, O, O, N) – S in 1st, O in 3rd, but double O might be unlikely
- SHOWN (S, H, O, W, N) – S in 1st, O in 3rd, no A/R/E
- SMOKE (but E is excluded)
- SLOSH (S, L, O, S, H) – S appears twice, but valid word

""SHOWN"" seems strong: S in 1st, H, O in 3rd, W, N – no A/R/E, and S is in correct position (1st) in this case.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (from both guesses).
2. The word contains S and the S is in position 1 (from SHOWN’s S(✓)).
3. The word contains N but N is not in position 5 (from SHOWN’s N(-)).
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, H, W.
5. Allowed positions for N: 2, 3, or 4.  But 3 is already O, so N must be in 2 or 4.
6. Allowed positions for S: only 1 (already confirmed).
7. We still need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, H, W.

Current pattern: S _ O _ _

Possible N positions:
- If N is in 2: S N O _ _
- If N is in 4: S _ O N _

Let’s explore both.

Case 1 – N in 2: SN O _ _
Need two more letters (positions 4 & 5) from remaining unused consonants/vowels that are not forbidden.
Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, Y, etc.
Try to form real words:
- SNOUT – uses U, T (both allowed)
- SNOWS – W is forbidden
- SNOBS – B, S (but S already used once, though repetition allowed)
- SNACK – C, K allowed
- SNOWY – W, Y forbidden

SNOUT seems valid.

Case 2 – N in 4: S _ O N _
Need letters for positions 2 & 5.
- SPOON – P, but O already in 3, double O unlikely
- STONY – T, Y allowed, but N already placed in 4
- SLOAN – L, A (A forbidden)
- SMOKN – not a word

SNOUT is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- S in 1 ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or finding letters in the word. 

I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is somewhere except the 4th position
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Contains S somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

I need a word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position
- Contains S (but not in 4th position)
- Does not contain A, R, E

Possible candidates:
- STONY (S, T, O, N, Y) – S in 1st position, O in 3rd, no A/R/E
- SPOON (S, P, O, O, N) – S in 1st, O in 3rd, but double O might be unlikely
- SHOWN (S, H, O, W, N) – S in 1st, O in 3rd, no A/R/E
- SMOKE (but E is excluded)
- SLOSH (S, L, O, S, H) – S appears twice, but valid word

""SHOWN"" seems strong: S in 1st, H, O in 3rd, W, N – no A/R/E, and S is in correct position (1st) in this case.

Guess 2: SHOWN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) W(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is O (from both guesses).
2. The word contains S and the S is in position 1 (from SHOWN’s S(✓)).
3. The word contains N but N is not in position 5 (from SHOWN’s N(-)).
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, H, W.
5. Allowed positions for N: 2, 3, or 4.  But 3 is already O, so N must be in 2 or 4.
6. Allowed positions for S: only 1 (already confirmed).
7. We still need three more letters, none of which are A, R, E, H, W.

Current pattern: S _ O _ _

Possible N positions:
- If N is in 2: S N O _ _
- If N is in 4: S _ O N _

Let’s explore both.

Case 1 – N in 2: SN O _ _
Need two more letters (positions 4 & 5) from remaining unused consonants/vowels that are not forbidden.
Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, Y, etc.
Try to form real words:
- SNOUT – uses U, T (both allowed)
- SNOWS – W is forbidden
- SNOBS – B, S (but S already used once, though repetition allowed)
- SNACK – C, K allowed
- SNOWY – W, Y forbidden

SNOUT seems valid.

Case 2 – N in 4: S _ O N _
Need letters for positions 2 & 5.
- SPOON – P, but O already in 3, double O unlikely
- STONY – T, Y allowed, but N already placed in 4
- SLOAN – L, A (A forbidden)
- SMOKN – not a word

SNOUT is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- S in 1 ✓
- N in 2 ✓
- O in 3 ✓
- U and T not forbidden
- No A, R, E, H, W

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

2. Position 1 is S (✓ in SNOUT).
3. Position 2 is N (✓ in SNOUT).
4. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, E, H, W, U, T.
5. Current pattern: S N O _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden letters. Remaining common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, V, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with ""SNO"" and uses only allowed letters. Possible candidates:
- SNOWS (but W and S are forbidden/already used)
- SNOBS (B, S allowed - but S already used once)
- SNOKS (K, S allowed - S already used)
- SNOIL (not a word)
- SNOMB (not a word)
- SNOPY (not a word)
- SNOMA (A forbidden)
- SNOMI (not a word)
- SNOMO (not a word)

Looking at valid English words, ""SNOWS"" is invalid (W and S). ""SNOBS"" is a valid word (slang for snobs) and uses B (allowed) and S (already used once, but letters can repeat). However, since S is already in position 1, repeating S in position 5 is allowed unless specified otherwise.

But let's check if there's a word without repeating S. ""SNOKS"" is valid (a type of fishing net), uses K and S. Again S is repeated.

Another option: ""SNOMA"" - but A is forbidden.

Looking at remaining letters: C, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, V, Y.

Valid words:
- SNOWS - invalid
- SNOCK - C, K (but C and K are allowed)
- SNOCK is a valid word (a type of axe)

Let's verify:
- S N O C K
- Letters: S, N, O, C, K
- All letters are allowed (no A, R, E, H, W, U, T)
- All positions match the constraints

Thus, the next guess should be SNOCK.

However, let’s double-check a dictionary for any valid words starting with “SNO” and ending with two letters from the remaining set. The valid English words starting with “SNO” are:
- SNOWS (invalid)
- SNOBS (valid, but S repeats)
- SNOKS (invalid)
- SNOMA (invalid)

It appears “SNOBS” is the only valid word left, despite the repeated S. Since the game allows letter repetition unless specified otherwise, and we have no feedback against it, we should try it.

But wait, we haven’t tried “SNOBS” yet. Let me verify:
- S N O B S

However, let’s double-check a dictionary for any valid words starting with “SNO” and ending with two letters from the remaining set. The valid English words starting with “SNO” are:
- SNOWS (invalid)
- SNOBS (valid, but S repeats)
- SNOKS (invalid)
- SNOMA (invalid)
- SNOPY (invalid)
- SNOID (invalid)

It appears “SNOBS” is the only valid word left, despite the repeated S. Since the game allows letter repetition unless specified otherwise, and we have no feedback against it, we should try it.

But wait, we haven’t tried “SNOBS” yet. Let me verify:
- S N O B S
- Letters: S, N, O, B, S
- No forbidden letters
- Meets all positional constraints

Thus, the next guess is SNOBS.",Guess 6: SNOBS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(✓) O(✓) B(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
