For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, none of which are in their current positions.  
We need a 5-letter word that:

- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).

- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1).
- C is a new letter (position 4).
- T is a new letter (position 5).

This gives us four known letters in new positions plus two fresh consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, none of which are in their current positions.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S, E (and one more unknown letter).
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E was only excluded from position 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1).
- C is a new letter (position 4).
- T is a new letter (position 5).

This gives us four known letters in new positions plus two fresh consonants.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on REACT:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with R E _ _ _
2. It must contain A (but not in position 3).
3. It must not contain O, C, T.

We still need three more letters. The remaining common consonants are S, L, N, D, G, H, etc. and the remaining vowels are I, U (since A and E are already used).

A good candidate is “READS”:
- R E A D S
- A is in position 3 → but feedback said A is not in position 3 → invalid.

Next candidate: “REAPS”:
- R E A P S
- A is in position 3 → again invalid.

Candidate: “REBAN” (but N is allowed, B is allowed):
- R E B A N
- A is in position 4 → allowed (only excluded from 1,2,3,5).
- No O, C, T.
- All letters are valid.

Another candidate: “REBAS”:
- R E B A S
- A in position 4 → allowed.
- No O, C, T.

Between “REBAN” and “REBAS”, “REBAS” is a more common word.

Let’s try “REBAS”.

From the feedback so far we know:

- The word must be R E _ A S (positions 1-2-4-5 are locked in).
- Letters already ruled out for position 3: B, G, C, T, O.
- Letters already used/confirmed: R, E, A, S.
- We still need a consonant in position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: D, F, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Scanning the pattern R E _ A S for valid 5-letter English words:

- REDAS – not valid
- REFAS – not valid
- REHAS – not valid
- RELAS – not standard (though “relax” is similar, doesn’t fit)
- REMAS – not standard
- RENAS – not standard
- REVAS – not valid
- REPAS – not standard (though “repas” is French for meals, not common English)
- REFAS – no
- REWAS – no
- REXAS – no

The only remaining valid English word that fits the pattern R E _ A S and uses an allowed consonant is:

- REDAS – invalid
- REGAS – tried (G out)
- REBAS – tried (B out)
- REFAS – no
- RELAS – no
- REMAS – no
- RENAS – no
- REVAS – no

- RECAS – C ruled out
- REDAS – invalid
- REGAS – G ruled out
- RELAS – invalid
- REMAS – invalid
- RENAS – invalid
- REXAS – invalid
- REFAS – invalid
- REVAS – invalid
- REPAS – invalid

It appears the only remaining valid word is “REDAS,” but it’s not recognized as standard. This suggests the correct word might be “REBAS” (but B was ruled out), “REGAS” (G ruled out), etc.

However, reviewing the feedback carefully:
- Guess 3: REBAS → R(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓) S(✓) → B is out.
- Guess 4: REGAS → R(✓) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) S(✓) → G is out.

The only remaining consonant that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid word is “D,” even though “REDAS” isn’t standard. This indicates the word must be “REDAS,” despite its rarity.

But let’s verify one last time. Another possible word: “REHAB” – no, that doesn’t fit the pattern.

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only remaining valid word fitting R E _ A S with allowed letters is “REDAS,” so we’ll proceed with that.

- RENAS – invalid

- REPAS – invalid

It appears the only remaining valid word is “REDAS,” but it’s not recognized as standard. This suggests the correct word might be “REBAS” (but B was ruled out), “REGAS” (G ruled out), etc.

However, reviewing the feedback carefully:
- Guess 3: REBAS → R(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓) S(✓) → B is out.
- Guess 4: REGAS → R(✓) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) S(✓) → G is out.

The only remaining consonant that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid word is “D,” even though “REDAS” isn’t standard. This indicates the word must be “REDAS,” despite its rarity.

But let’s verify one last time. Another possible word: “REHAB” – no, that doesn’t fit the pattern.

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only remaining valid word fitting R E _ A S with allowed letters is “REDAS,” so we’ll proceed with that.",Guess 5: REDAS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) D(x) A(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters. 

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", and ""ADIEU"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it uses five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E, none of which are in their current positions.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S, E (and one more unknown letter).
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places R somewhere other than position 2.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E was only excluded from position 5).
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from position 1).
- C is a new letter (position 4).
- T is a new letter (position 5).

This gives us four known letters in new positions plus two fresh consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on REACT:
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- T(x) – T is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with R E _ _ _
2. It must contain A (but not in position 3).
3. It must not contain O, C, T.

We still need three more letters. The remaining common consonants are S, L, N, D, G, H, etc. and the remaining vowels are I, U (since A and E are already used).

A good candidate is “READS”:
- R E A D S
- A is in position 3 → but feedback said A is not in position 3 → invalid.

Next candidate: “REAPS”:
- R E A P S
- A is in position 3 → again invalid.

Candidate: “REBAN” (but N is allowed, B is allowed):
- R E B A N
- A is in position 4 → allowed (only excluded from 1,2,3,5).
- No O, C, T.
- All letters are valid.

Another candidate: “REBAS”:
- R E B A S
- A in position 4 → allowed.
- No O, C, T.

Between “REBAN” and “REBAS”, “REBAS” is a more common word.

Let’s try “REBAS”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)
Guess 3: REBAS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 3 (REBAS) we now have:
- R(✓) – position 1 (already known)
- E(✓) – position 2 (already known)
- B(x) – B is NOT in the word
- A(✓) – A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4)
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5)

So the word is now fully determined except for the third letter:
R E _ A S

We also know from earlier feedback that:
- O, C, T, B are not in the word
- A, R, E, S are already placed correctly
- The missing third letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out

Common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words matching the pattern RE _ AS:
- REDAS – not a valid word
- REGAS – not common
- RELAS – Spanish for ""relax"", not English
- REMAS – not a word
- REPAS – not a word
- REFAS – not a word
- RENAS – not standard
- REXAS – not standard
- RIVAS – not matching
- RODAS – not matching
- REXAS – not matching

Wait, let's think systematically. The pattern is RE _ AS. The blank must be a consonant that forms a valid word.

Valid English words:
- REBAS – already tried
- RECAS – invalid (C is out)
- REDAS – invalid
- REGAS – valid (though rare, ""regas"" is a word meaning to re-ignite)
- RELAS – not standard
- REMAS – not standard
- RENAS – not standard
- REXAS – not standard

""REGAS"" is the only valid word left that fits the pattern and constraints.

But let me double-check: are there other consonants I missed? For example, ""F"":
- REFAS – not a word
- REFAS – no

""V"":
- REVAS – not a word

""N"":
- RENAS – no

""L"":
- RELAS – no

""M"":
- REMAS – no

""G"" seems to be the only valid option left, even if ""REGAS"" is uncommon.

Therefore, the correct word must be ""REGAS"".

From the feedback so far we know:

- The word must be R E _ A S (positions 1-2-4-5 are locked in).
- Letters already ruled out for position 3: B, G, C, T, O.
- Letters already used/confirmed: R, E, A, S.
- We still need a consonant in position 3 that hasn’t been eliminated.

Remaining common consonants not yet tried: D, F, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Scanning the pattern R E _ A S for valid 5-letter English words:

- REDAS – not valid
- REFAS – not valid
- REHAS – not valid
- RELAS – not standard (though “relax” is similar, doesn’t fit)
- REMAS – not standard
- RENAS – not standard
- REVAS – not valid
- REPAS – not standard (though “repas” is French for meals, not common English)
- REFAS – no
- REWAS – no
- REXAS – no

The only remaining valid English word that fits the pattern R E _ A S and uses an allowed consonant is:

- REDAS – invalid
- REGAS – tried (G out)
- REBAS – tried (B out)
- REFAS – no
- RELAS – no
- REMAS – no
- RENAS – no
- REVAS – no
- REPAS – not standard
- REHAS – no
- REXAS – no

Wait, let’s double-check a dictionary or word list for R E _ A S:

Valid English words:
- REBAS – B ruled out
- RECAS – C ruled out
- REDAS – invalid
- REGAS – G ruled out
- RELAS – invalid
- REMAS – invalid
- RENAS – invalid
- REXAS – invalid
- REFAS – invalid
- REVAS – invalid
- REPAS – invalid

It appears the only remaining valid word is “REDAS,” but it’s not recognized as standard. This suggests the correct word might be “REBAS” (but B was ruled out), “REGAS” (G ruled out), etc.

However, reviewing the feedback carefully:
- Guess 3: REBAS → R(✓) E(✓) B(x) A(✓) S(✓) → B is out.
- Guess 4: REGAS → R(✓) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) S(✓) → G is out.

The only remaining consonant that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid word is “D,” even though “REDAS” isn’t standard. This indicates the word must be “REDAS,” despite its rarity.

But let’s verify one last time. Another possible word: “REHAB” – no, that doesn’t fit the pattern.

Upon closer inspection, the correct and only remaining valid word fitting R E _ A S with allowed letters is “REDAS,” so we’ll proceed with that.
