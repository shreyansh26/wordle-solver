1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common in English words. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Excludes A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, L, N, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O is already known to be present).

A strong candidate is “POINT”:
- Uses O in position 2 (not 3, so allowed).
- Uses common letters P, I, N, T.
- Avoids A, R, S, E.

Other options could be “DONUT”, “FOUL”, “MOUND”, etc., but “POINT” is a common word with high-frequency letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), T (position 5)  
So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ T

We still need three more letters, none of which are in the forbidden set above.  
Good remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides O)

A high-information next guess should use fresh common letters in the blanks.  
“CLOUD” is invalid (has L and U, but O is already fixed at position 2).  
“MOULT” is a valid candidate: M, O, U, L, T.  
But O is already known at position 2, so we can’t have it again.  
“FOUL” is only 4 letters.  
“BOUGH” is 6 letters.  
A 5-letter word that fits _ O _ _ T and uses new common letters is “COBUT” (but that’s not a valid English word).  
Another valid word: “DOUGH” – but again repeats O in position 2, which we already fixed.  
“GOULD” – uses G, O, U, L, D.  O is at position 2, so this would be _ O U L D, but we only have 5 letters and T must be at 5.  So “GOULD” is 5 letters but ends in D, not T.  

Let’s list valid _ O _ _ T words with new letters:

- “COULD” – ends in D, not T  
- “DOUBT” – ends in T, uses D, O, U, B, T.  O is at 2, T at 5.  Letters B, U, D are new and allowed.

The most frequent letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters. \n\nOne such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common in English words. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  \nSo the secret word:\n- Contains the letter O, but not in position 3.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.\n\nWe now need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

O is at position 2, so this would be _ O U L D, but we only have 5 letters and T must be at 5.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), T (position 5), U (position 3), B (somewhere but not position 4)  

So the secret word looks like: _ O U _ T  
And B must appear somewhere in the remaining blanks (positions 1 or 4).

Valid 5-letter English words that fit _ O U _ T and contain B:
- BOUAT – invalid (A forbidden)  
- BOULT – uses B, O, U, L, T → fits _ O U _ T and includes B  
- BOUET – invalid (E forbidden)  
- BOUGT – invalid (G not yet ruled out, but word must end in T; “BOUGT” is not a standard spelling)  

The only valid candidate is “BOULT”.

Let’s verify:
- B is in the word (✓)  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- U is in position 3 (✓)  
- T is in position 5 (✓)  
- L is a new letter to test in position 4.  

Therefore, “BOULT” is the optimal next guess.
