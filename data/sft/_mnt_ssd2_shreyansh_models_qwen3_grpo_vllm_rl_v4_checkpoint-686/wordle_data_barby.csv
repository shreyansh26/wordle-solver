2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not.

1. Uses A and R (since they’re confirmed present).

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that spreads the letters out. “TRAIN” comes to mind:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known in word, now in position 2)

- B, A, R, Y are in the word and in the exact positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, E.
- Contains both A and R, but neither is in its guessed position (1st and 2nd respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that spreads the letters out. “TRAIN” comes to mind:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known in word, now in position 2)
- A (known in word, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)

This tests new positions for R and A while introducing fresh letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2 (already known) and also not in position 3.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3 (and already known not in position 1).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A and R.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3.
- Positions ruled out for R: 2, 3.

Remaining vowels: U (A and E, I, O are out).
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places R in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).

Let’s try a word that spreads A and R across the remaining positions. A good candidate is “CURVA”:
- C, U, V are new letters.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (but position 3 is ruled out for R from guess 1 feedback). Oops, that’s invalid.

Next try: “MARCH”:
- M, C, H are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (still ruled out). Not good.

Next try: “RANCH”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is already ruled out. So invalid.

Next try: “RAPID”:
- I and D are new, but I is ruled out. Invalid.

Next try: “CARGO”:
- O is ruled out. Invalid.

Next try: “CRAMP”:
- A is in position 3 (ruled out). Invalid.

Next try: “GRASP”:

Next try: “BARKY”:
- B, K, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- K and Y are new letters to test.

This seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No disallowed letters.
- A in position 2, R in position 1.

Let’s go with BARKY.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word, whether they're in the correct position or not.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, E.
- Contains both A and R, but neither is in its guessed position (1st and 2nd respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that spreads the letters out. “TRAIN” comes to mind:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known in word, now in position 2)
- A (known in word, now in position 3)
- I (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)

This tests new positions for R and A while introducing fresh letters.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word, not in position 2 (already known) and also not in position 3.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3 (and already known not in position 1).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A and R.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3.
- Positions ruled out for R: 2, 3.

Remaining vowels: U (A and E, I, O are out).
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
- Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Places R in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).

Let’s try a word that spreads A and R across the remaining positions. A good candidate is “CURVA”:
- C, U, V are new letters.
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (but position 3 is ruled out for R from guess 1 feedback). Oops, that’s invalid.

Next try: “MARCH”:
- M, C, H are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (still ruled out). Not good.

Next try: “RANCH”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is already ruled out. So invalid.

Next try: “RAPID”:
- I and D are new, but I is ruled out. Invalid.

Next try: “CARGO”:
- O is ruled out. Invalid.

Next try: “CRAMP”:
- A is in position 3 (ruled out). Invalid.

Next try: “GRASP”:
- S is ruled out. Invalid.

Next try: “BARKY”:
- B, K, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- K and Y are new letters to test.

This seems valid:
- Contains A and R.
- No disallowed letters.
- A in position 2, R in position 1.

Let’s go with BARKY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: BARKY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

BARKY → B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

- B, A, R, Y are in the word and in the exact positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- K is not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the form:
B A R _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with B, has A in position 2, R in position 3, and Y in position 5. The fourth letter must be a consonant that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Letters already ruled out (from all guesses): O, S, E, T, I, N, K.

Possible remaining consonants for position 4: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (common ones: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P).

Looking for common 5-letter words matching B A R _ Y:
- BARCY – not a valid word.
- BARFY – not a valid word.
- BARGY – valid (a type of boat or a coin).
- BARLY – valid (a unit of mass for grains).
- BARBY – valid (a diminutive of Barbara).

Among these, ""BARGY"" is the most common English word. Let’s verify:
- B(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), Y(5) – matches the feedback pattern.
- G hasn’t been tested yet and isn’t ruled out.

Therefore, the correct word should be BARGY.

From the latest feedback:

BARGY → B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓)

So the pattern is still:
B A R _ Y
with the fourth letter NOT being G (and we already know it’s not K, O, S, E, T, I, N).

Letters ruled out so far for position 4: G, K, O, S, E, T, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter words fitting B A R _ Y:
- BARCY – invalid
- BARFY – invalid
- BARGY – already tried, G fails
- BARLY – valid
- BARBY – valid
- BARRY – valid (double R)

Among these, BARLY is the most common English word. Let’s test it.
