### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on AROSE:

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, N, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 5 again (from UNTIE) — still only position 5 ruled out.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE).
- I is in the word and already in the correct position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
And the letters we must use somewhere: E, N  
The letters we must avoid: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains both E and N exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted).
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: E (already must appear), I (fixed), Y (sometimes vowel).

Let’s try to place N and E while keeping the forbidden letters out.

One candidate: ""DINGE""
- D, I, N, G, E
- I is in position 3, but we need it in position 4. So invalid.

Another candidate: ""FLENI"" – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Another candidate: ""MIDGE""
- M, I, D, G, E
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""WOKEN"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""PINEY""
- P, I, N, E, Y
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""BINGE""
- B, I, N, G, E
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""LINED""
- L, I, N, E, D
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""WINED"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""KNEEL"" – but E appears twice and L is allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""BENCH"" – but C and H are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""VENOM"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""FENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""MENSE"" – but S is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""HENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""PENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – G, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – same issue.

Another candidate: ""FIVEN"" – F, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""HIVEN"" – H, I, V, E, N

- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ZIVEN"" – Z, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

It seems every common placement of I in position 4 with N and E is blocked by forbidden letters. Let me re-examine.

We need: _ _ _ I _ with E and N somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible word: ""NEIGH""
- N, E, I, G, H
- I is in position 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INANE"" – but A and N twice, A forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ENEMY"" – E, N, E, M, Y
- E appears twice, but we don’t know if E appears twice. Also I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INERT"" – I, N, E, R, T
- R and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""INNIE"" – I, N, N, I, E
- I appears twice, but we only know I is confirmed once. Also N appears twice. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ELBOW"" – O is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ELFIN"" – E, L, F, I, N
- I is in position 4! This fits:
  - E, L, F, I, N
  - I is in position 4 (correct)
  - E is in position 1 (new position)
  - N is in position 5 (new position)
  - L and F are new letters not yet ruled out
  - No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, T) are used

This seems valid. Let me check if ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:

- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, N, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 5 again (from UNTIE) — still only position 5 ruled out.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE).
- I is in the word and already in the correct position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
And the letters we must use somewhere: E, N  
The letters we must avoid: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains both E and N exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted).
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: E (already must appear), I (fixed), Y (sometimes vowel).

Let’s try to place N and E while keeping the forbidden letters out.

One candidate: ""DINGE""
- D, I, N, G, E
- I is in position 3, but we need it in position 4. So invalid.

Another candidate: ""FLENI"" – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Another candidate: ""MIDGE""
- M, I, D, G, E
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""WOKEN"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""PINEY""
- P, I, N, E, Y
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""BINGE""
- B, I, N, G, E
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""LINED""
- L, I, N, E, D
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""WINED"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""KNEEL"" – but E appears twice and L is allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""BENCH"" – but C and H are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""VENOM"" – but O and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""FENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""MENSE"" – but S is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""HENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""PENCE"" – but C and E are allowed, but I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – G, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – same issue.

Another candidate: ""FIVEN"" – F, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""HIVEN"" – H, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""KIVEN"" – K, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""LIVEN"" – L, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""MIVEN"" – M, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""RIVEN"" – R is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""TIVEN"" – T is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""WIVEN"" – W, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ZIVEN"" – Z, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

It seems every common placement of I in position 4 with N and E is blocked by forbidden letters. Let me re-examine.

We need: _ _ _ I _ with E and N somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible word: ""NEIGH""
- N, E, I, G, H
- I is in position 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INANE"" – but A and N twice, A forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ENEMY"" – E, N, E, M, Y
- E appears twice, but we don’t know if E appears twice. Also I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INERT"" – I, N, E, R, T
- R and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""INNIE"" – I, N, N, I, E
- I appears twice, but we only know I is confirmed once. Also N appears twice. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ELBOW"" – O is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ELFIN"" – E, L, F, I, N
- I is in position 4! This fits:
  - E, L, F, I, N
  - I is in position 4 (correct)
  - E is in position 1 (new position)
  - N is in position 5 (new position)
  - L and F are new letters not yet ruled out
  - No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, T) are used

This seems valid. Let me check if ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

So my next guess is ""ELFIN"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position so far):
A, R, O, S, U, T, F

Letters that ARE in the word (at least once each):
E, N, I

Correct positions so far:
- I is definitely in position 4.

Positions ruled out for each of these three letters:
- E is NOT in position 1 (from ELFIN) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE and UNTIE).  
  So E must be in position 2 or 3.

- N is NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE) and NOT in position 5 (from ELFIN).  
  So N must be in position 1 or 3.

- I is locked in position 4.

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, T, F

So the pattern is: _ _ _ I _ with the constraints:
- One of the blanks must be E (in position 2 or 3).
- One of the blanks must be N (in position 1 or 3).
- The remaining blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s enumerate the two viable arrangements:

1) N in position 1, E in position 2: N E _ I _
2) N in position 1, E in position 3: N _ E I _
3) E in position 2, N in position 3: _ E N I _

We need a valid 5-letter word for each.

Option 1: N E _ I _
Need a consonant for position 3. Try “NECIX” – not valid. “NEGIN” – not valid. “NEBIX” – invalid. “NEBIA” – A is forbidden. “NEGIN” – invalid. Seems no common word.

Option 2: N _ E I _
Try N _ E I _ with consonants: N B E I D – not a word. N C E I D – not a word. N D E I T – T forbidden. N G E I D – not a word. N H E I D – not a word. N L E I D – “NLEID” – invalid. N M E I D – invalid. N P E I D – invalid. N V E I D – invalid. N W E I D – invalid. N Y E I D – invalid. No common word here.

Option 3: _ E N I _
Need a consonant in position 1 and 5. Position 5 must be a consonant not yet used. Common words fitting: “BENIN” – not valid. “VENIN” – not valid. “HENIN” – invalid. “DENIN” – invalid. “GENIN” – invalid. “KENIN” – invalid. “LENIN” – valid (though proper noun, but Wordle accepts it). “MENIN” – invalid. “PENIN” – invalid. “VENIN” – invalid. “YENIN” – invalid. “ZENIN” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word has two vowels plus I in position 4. But we already have I, and E is required. The only other vowel left is Y.

Another arrangement: _ E _ I N  
This uses N in position 5 (allowed, since N only forbidden in 2 and 5 in previous guesses, but 5 was only ruled out for E and N in ELFIN says N is not in 5? Wait:

From ELFIN: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 5. So N must be in 1 or 3.

Thus _ E N I _ is possible.

Let’s try “DENIM” – but M is allowed. Check letters: D, E, N, I, M.  
- D: not ruled out  
- E: position 2 (allowed)  
- N: position 3 (allowed)  
- I: position 4 (correct)  
- M: not ruled out  

No forbidden letters. “DENIM” is a valid word.

So the guess is DENIM.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that uses none of A, R, O, S and has E somewhere in positions 1-4.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

A strong next guess would be “UNTIE”:
- Uses E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I that haven’t been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S).

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, N, I

- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 5 again (from UNTIE) — still only position 5 ruled out.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE).
- I is in the word and already in the correct position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
And the letters we must use somewhere: E, N  
The letters we must avoid: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains both E and N exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted).

Another candidate: ""WIVEN"" – W, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ZIVEN"" – Z, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

It seems every common placement of I in position 4 with N and E is blocked by forbidden letters. Let me re-examine.

We need: _ _ _ I _ with E and N somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible word: ""NEIGH""
- N, E, I, G, H
- I is in position 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INANE"" – but A and N twice, A forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ENEMY"" – E, N, E, M, Y
- E appears twice, but we don’t know if E appears twice. Also I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INERT"" – I, N, E, R, T
- R and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""INNIE"" – I, N, N, I, E
- I appears twice, but we only know I is confirmed once. Also N appears twice. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ELBOW"" – O is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ELFIN"" – E, L, F, I, N
- I is in position 4! This fits:
  - E, L, F, I, N
  - I is in position 4 (correct)
  - E is in position 1 (new position)
  - N is in position 5 (new position)
  - L and F are new letters not yet ruled out
  - No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, T) are used

This seems valid. Let me check if ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

So my next guess is ""ELFIN"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position so far):
A, R, O, S, U, T, F

Letters that ARE in the word (at least once each):
E, N, I

Correct positions so far:
- I is definitely in position 4.

Positions ruled out for each of these three letters:
- E is NOT in position 1 (from ELFIN) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE and UNTIE).  
  So E must be in position 2 or 3.

- N is NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE) and NOT in position 5 (from ELFIN).  
  So N must be in position 1 or 3.

- I is locked in position 4.

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, T, F

So the pattern is: _ _ _ I _ with the constraints:
- One of the blanks must be E (in position 2 or 3).
- One of the blanks must be N (in position 1 or 3).
- The remaining blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s enumerate the two viable arrangements:

1) N in position 1, E in position 2: N E _ I _
2) N in position 1, E in position 3: N _ E I _
3) E in position 2, N in position 3: _ E N I _

We need a valid 5-letter word for each.

Option 1: N E _ I _
Need a consonant for position 3. Try “NECIX” – not valid. “NEGIN” – not valid. “NEBIX” – invalid. “NEBIA” – A is forbidden. “NEGIN” – invalid. Seems no common word.

Option 2: N _ E I _
Try N _ E I _ with consonants: N B E I D – not a word. N C E I D – not a word. N D E I T – T forbidden. N G E I D – not a word. N H E I D – not a word. N L E I D – “NLEID” – invalid. N M E I D – invalid. N P E I D – invalid. N V E I D – invalid. N W E I D – invalid. N Y E I D – invalid. No common word here.

Option 3: _ E N I _
Need a consonant in position 1 and 5. Position 5 must be a consonant not yet used. Common words fitting: “BENIN” – not valid. “VENIN” – not valid. “HENIN” – invalid. “DENIN” – invalid. “GENIN” – invalid. “KENIN” – invalid. “LENIN” – valid (though proper noun, but Wordle accepts it). “MENIN” – invalid. “PENIN” – invalid. “VENIN” – invalid. “YENIN” – invalid. “ZENIN” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word has two vowels plus I in position 4. But we already have I, and E is required. The only other vowel left is Y.

Another arrangement: _ E _ I N  
This uses N in position 5 (allowed, since N only forbidden in 2 and 5 in previous guesses, but 5 was only ruled out for E and N in ELFIN says N is not in 5? Wait:

From ELFIN: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 5. So N must be in 1 or 3.

Thus _ E N I _ is possible.

Let’s try “DENIM” – but M is allowed. Check letters: D, E, N, I, M.  
- D: not ruled out  
- E: position 2 (allowed)  
- N: position 3 (allowed)  
- I: position 4 (correct)  
- M: not ruled out  

No forbidden letters. “DENIM” is a valid word.

So the guess is DENIM.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions early
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but NOT in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that uses none of A, R, O, S and has E somewhere in positions 1-4.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

A strong next guess would be “UNTIE”:
- Uses E in position 4 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I that haven’t been ruled out.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S).

From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: E, N, I  
Positions ruled out so far:
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 5 again (from UNTIE) — still only position 5 ruled out.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE).
- I is in the word and already in the correct position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _  
And the letters we must use somewhere: E, N  
The letters we must avoid: A, R, O, S, U, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.
- Contains both E and N exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted).
- Uses none of the forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – G, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""GIVEN"" – same issue.

Another candidate: ""FIVEN"" – F, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""HIVEN"" – H, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""KIVEN"" – K, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""LIVEN"" – L, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""MIVEN"" – M, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""RIVEN"" – R is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""TIVEN"" – T is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""WIVEN"" – W, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ZIVEN"" – Z, I, V, E, N
- I is in position 2, not 4. Invalid.

It seems every common placement of I in position 4 with N and E is blocked by forbidden letters. Let me re-examine.

We need: _ _ _ I _ with E and N somewhere in positions 1,2,3,5.

Possible word: ""NEIGH""
- N, E, I, G, H
- I is in position 3, not 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INANE"" – but A and N twice, A forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ENEMY"" – E, N, E, M, Y
- E appears twice, but we don’t know if E appears twice. Also I must be in position 4. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""INERT"" – I, N, E, R, T
- R and T are forbidden.

Another candidate: ""INNIE"" – I, N, N, I, E
- I appears twice, but we only know I is confirmed once. Also N appears twice. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""ELBOW"" – O is forbidden.

Another candidate: ""ELFIN"" – E, L, F, I, N
- I is in position 4! This fits:
  - E, L, F, I, N
  - I is in position 4 (correct)
  - E is in position 1 (new position)
  - N is in position 5 (new position)
  - L and F are new letters not yet ruled out
  - No forbidden letters (A, R, O, S, U, T) are used

This seems valid. Let me check if ""ELFIN"" is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is.

So my next guess is ""ELFIN"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position so far):
A, R, O, S, U, T, F

Letters that ARE in the word (at least once each):
E, N, I

Correct positions so far:
- I is definitely in position 4.

Positions ruled out for each of these three letters:
- E is NOT in position 1 (from ELFIN) and NOT in position 5 (from AROSE and UNTIE).  
  So E must be in position 2 or 3.

- N is NOT in position 2 (from UNTIE) and NOT in position 5 (from ELFIN).  
  So N must be in position 1 or 3.

- I is locked in position 4.

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, O, S, U, T, F

So the pattern is: _ _ _ I _ with the constraints:
- One of the blanks must be E (in position 2 or 3).
- One of the blanks must be N (in position 1 or 3).
- The remaining blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s enumerate the two viable arrangements:

1) N in position 1, E in position 2: N E _ I _
2) N in position 1, E in position 3: N _ E I _
3) E in position 2, N in position 3: _ E N I _

We need a valid 5-letter word for each.

Option 1: N E _ I _
Need a consonant for position 3. Try “NECIX” – not valid. “NEGIN” – not valid. “NEBIX” – invalid. “NEBIA” – A is forbidden. “NEGIN” – invalid. Seems no common word.

Option 2: N _ E I _
Try N _ E I _ with consonants: N B E I D – not a word. N C E I D – not a word. N D E I T – T forbidden. N G E I D – not a word. N H E I D – not a word. N L E I D – “NLEID” – invalid. N M E I D – invalid. N P E I D – invalid. N V E I D – invalid. N W E I D – invalid. N Y E I D – invalid. No common word here.

Option 3: _ E N I _
Need a consonant in position 1 and 5. Position 5 must be a consonant not yet used. Common words fitting: “BENIN” – not valid. “VENIN” – not valid. “HENIN” – invalid. “DENIN” – invalid. “GENIN” – invalid. “KENIN” – invalid. “LENIN” – valid (though proper noun, but Wordle accepts it). “MENIN” – invalid. “PENIN” – invalid. “VENIN” – invalid. “YENIN” – invalid. “ZENIN” – invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word has two vowels plus I in position 4. But we already have I, and E is required. The only other vowel left is Y.

Another arrangement: _ E _ I N  
This uses N in position 5 (allowed, since N only forbidden in 2 and 5 in previous guesses, but 5 was only ruled out for E and N in ELFIN says N is not in 5? Wait:

From ELFIN: N(-) means N is in word but not in position 5. So N must be in 1 or 3.

Thus _ E N I _ is possible.

Let’s try “DENIM” – but M is allowed. Check letters: D, E, N, I, M.  
- D: not ruled out  
- E: position 2 (allowed)  
- N: position 3 (allowed)  
- I: position 4 (correct)  
- M: not ruled out  

No forbidden letters. “DENIM” is a valid word.

So the guess is DENIM.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: ELFIN -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) F(x) I(✓) N(-)
Guess 4: DENIM -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) N(✓) I(✓) M(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DENIM:

- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- I(✓) → I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- M(-) → M is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown (must be a consonant not yet ruled out).
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: N (fixed).
- Position 4: I (fixed).
- Position 5: unknown (must be a consonant, not M, and not any already ruled-out letters).

Letters we know must appear: E, N, I, M.
Letters we know must NOT appear: A, R, O, S, U, T, F, D.

So the word looks like: _ E N I _ with M somewhere. Since M is not in position 5, it must be in position 1.

Thus the only possible arrangement is: M E N I _.

But we need a 5-letter word of the form MEN I _. The only common English word fitting this is ""MENIX"" (though rare) or ""MENIT"" (invalid). Actually, ""MENIA"" is invalid due to A. ""MENIC"" is not a word. ""MENID"" is invalid. ""MENIS"" is invalid due to S. ""MENIT"" is invalid. ""MENIX"" is valid (anatomy term).

But let me double-check if there are other possibilities. Could position 1 be another letter and M be in position 5? No, because M is not allowed in position 5. So M must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be ""MENIX"".

But ""MENIX"" is a valid 5-letter English word (plural of meninx).

So the final guess is MENIX.
