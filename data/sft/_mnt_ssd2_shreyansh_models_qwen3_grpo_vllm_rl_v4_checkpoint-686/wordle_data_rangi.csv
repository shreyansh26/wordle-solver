For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not 3).
2. Avoid S, L, T, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates: CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO, RAISE, etc.  
But we must avoid E and S, so RAISE is out (has E and S).  
Also avoid L and T.

Let’s pick a word with A in position 1 or 2, plus new common letters like R, N, C, D, M, etc.

A good choice is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3 in SLATE).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E).

From the three guesses:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) K(x)
   - R is in the word, not in position 2.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - N is in the word, not in position 4.

3. DRAIN → D(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(-)
   - R is in the word, not in position 2 (confirmed).
   - A is in the word, not in position 3 (confirmed).
   - I is in the word, not in position 4.
   - N is in the word, not in position 5 (since position 5 gave (-)).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R, N, I
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, T, E, C, K, D
- Positions ruled out:
  - A: not 3
  - R: not 2
  - N: not 4 or 5
  - I: not 4

Since N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, it must be in position 1 or 2 or 3.
But positions 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A (in some order), so N must be in position 1.

Thus the word must start with N: N _ _ _ _

We still need to place A, R, I in the remaining four positions, respecting:
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 2
- I not in position 4

Possible positions:
1: N
2: A or I or R (but R cannot be in position 2) → A or I
3: A or R or I (A cannot be here) → R or I
4: I or R (I cannot be here) → R
5: A or I

But we have to use A, R, I exactly once each in positions 2-5.

Let's list possible permutations:
- N A R I _  → but we need 5 letters, so this is N A R I ? but we've used A,R,I,N and need one more letter. However, we know the word is only A,R,N,I plus one more letter not yet used. But we have only 4 letters (A,R,N,I) so this is impossible.

Wait, the word must contain A,R,N,I plus one more letter not yet used (must be from remaining letters not excluded: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

But the word is 5 letters and must contain A,R,N,I. So the fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Let me think differently: the word must contain A,R,N,I and one more letter not yet used. The positions are:
1: N (as deduced)
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

With constraints:
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 2
- I not in position 4

Let's try possible arrangements:

Option 1:
N A R I _ → but we need a fifth letter. The word would be N A R I ? but we've already used A,R,N,I. This suggests the word must contain A,R,N,I plus one more letter.

But the word is 5 letters and must contain A,R,N,I. So the fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet excluded. Let's pick a common remaining consonant like M.

Possible word: N A R I M → but this doesn't make sense as a word.

Alternative approach: Since N must be in position 1, and we have A,R,I to place in positions 2-5 with constraints, and one more letter.

But this seems complex. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with N that contain A,R,I and one more letter.

Possible candidates:
- NARWH (but W is uncommon)
- NARCI (but C is excluded)
- NARVI (V is possible)
- NARMI (M is possible)

But these might not be valid. Let me try NARVI - but this seems unlikely.

Another approach: Maybe the word is N A R I _ with a valid letter. Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with N and containing A,R,I.

Valid word: NARWH (a type of whale) - but this is obscure.

Alternatively, maybe the word is N A _ R I or N A _ I R, etc.

Let me try N A I R _ - but this is 4 letters plus one more.

This suggests I might have made an error in assuming N must be in position 1. Let me re-examine:

From DRAIN feedback:
- N is in the word but not in position 5. So N can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

From CRANK:
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus N can be in positions 1,2,3.

From SLATE:
- No info on N position.

So N could be in positions 1,2,3.

Let me re-examine possible positions:

We have letters A,R,N,I to place in the word, and one more letter.

But the word is 5 letters, so we need one more letter not yet used. Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word with N in position 2:

N _ A R I → but this would be N _ A R I, which is 5 letters. The missing letter must be in position 3. But A is already in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3 from SLATE feedback). So this is invalid.

N _ R A I → R in position 3, A in position 4 (allowed), I in 5 (allowed). The missing letter is in position 2. Possible letters: from remaining (B,F,G,H,J,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z). Let's pick M: N M R A I → but this isn't a valid word.

N _ R I A → I in 4 (not allowed), so invalid.

N _ A I R → A in 3 (not allowed), invalid.

N _ I A R → A in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed), I in 3 (allowed). Missing letter in position 2: N I A R ? but this is 4 letters.

This seems tricky. Let me try N in position 3:

_ _ N _ _ with A,R,I in remaining positions.

But positions:
- A not in 3 (already)
- R not in 2
- I not in 4

Possible arrangements:
- R A N I _ → but this is 4 letters.
- A R N I _ → 4 letters.

This suggests I need to include one more letter. Let me try:

N A R I _ with a valid letter. The word ""NARWH"" is valid but uncommon.

Alternatively, ""NARCI"" is invalid (C excluded).

""NARMI"" - not a word.

""NARVI"" - not a word.

""NARDO"" - but D is excluded.

""NARBO"" - B is possible, but not a word.

""NARCO"" - C excluded.

""NARCO"" invalid.

""NARWH"" seems to be the only possible, but it's obscure.

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""NINJA"" - but this has N twice, and we don't know if N is allowed to repeat.

""NINJA"" has:
- N in positions 1 and 2
- I in 3
- J in 4
- A in 5

But we have no info on J yet. Let's check constraints:
- A: position 5 (allowed, not 3)
- R: not in 2 (here R is in 3, allowed)
- N: in word, positions 1 and 2 (allowed, not 4 or 5)
- I: position 3 (allowed, not 4)
- J: new letter

This seems valid. But does ""NINJA"" contain R? No, it doesn't. So this violates our earlier conclusion that R is in the word.

Thus, ""NINJA"" is invalid.

Another approach: Since we have A,R,N,I to place, and one more letter, let's try:

N A I R _ → but this is 4 letters.

""N A I _ R"" → but this is 5 letters: N A I _ R. The missing letter in position 4 must be from remaining. But I is already in 3, A in 2, N in 1, R in 5. This would be N A I ? R. Possible letter: M → N A I M R - not a word.

""N I A R _"" → N I A R ? - but this is 4 letters.

This seems impossible with common words. Let me try ""NARWH"" even if obscure.

""NARWH"" has:
- N A R W H
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed, not 2)
- W new letter
- H new letter
- N in 1 (allowed)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

But to be safe, let me try ""NARWH"" as the guess.

Based on the feedback, we know the word contains A, R, N, I and does not contain S, L, T, E, C, K, D. The only remaining common consonants are B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (not 3).
2. Avoid S, L, T, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Good candidates: CRANE, ADIEU, AUDIO, RAISE, etc.  
But we must avoid E and S, so RAISE is out (has E and S).  
Also avoid L and T.

Let’s pick a word with A in position 1 or 2, plus new common letters like R, N, C, D, M, etc.

A good choice is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (different from position 3 in SLATE).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E).

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

2. CRANK → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(-) K(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms first guess).
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, K.
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, N (but each in unknown correct positions).

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, N, and avoids S, L, T, E, C, K. We also need to test new common consonants and vowels.

Let’s list possible positions for A, R, N:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- N cannot be in position 4.

Good next candidates should use these letters in new positions and introduce D, M, P, etc. A word like “DRAIN” comes to mind:
- D (new letter)
- R (must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, but not 2 from CRANK feedback – so positions 3,4,5)
- A (must not be in position 3 – here it’s in position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- N (must not be in position 4 – here it’s in position 5)

This tests:
- A in position 2
- R in position 3
- N in position 5
- Introduces D and I

- Positions ruled out:
  - A: not 3
  - R: not 2
  - N: not 4 or 5

Since N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, it must be in position 1 or 2 or 3.
But positions 2 and 3 are already taken by R and A (in some order), so N must be in position 1.

Thus the word must start with N: N _ _ _ _

3: A or R or I (A cannot be here) → R or I
4: I or R (I cannot be here) → R
5: A or I

But we have to use A, R, I exactly once each in positions 2-5.

Let's list possible permutations:
- N A R I _  → but we need 5 letters, so this is N A R I ? but we've used A,R,I,N and need one more letter. However, we know the word is only A,R,N,I plus one more letter not yet used. But we have only 4 letters (A,R,N,I) so this is impossible.

Wait, the word must contain A,R,N,I plus one more letter not yet used (must be from remaining letters not excluded: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

But the word is 5 letters and must contain A,R,N,I. So the fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

Let me think differently: the word must contain A,R,N,I and one more letter not yet used. The positions are:
1: N (as deduced)
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

With constraints:
- A not in position 3
- R not in position 2
- I not in position 4

Let's try possible arrangements:

Option 1:
N A R I _ → but we need a fifth letter. The word would be N A R I ? but we've already used A,R,N,I. This suggests the word must contain A,R,N,I plus one more letter.

But the word is 5 letters and must contain A,R,N,I. So the fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet excluded. Let's pick a common remaining consonant like M.

Possible word: N A R I M → but this doesn't make sense as a word.

Alternative approach: Since N must be in position 1, and we have A,R,I to place in positions 2-5 with constraints, and one more letter.

But this seems complex. Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with N that contain A,R,I and one more letter.

Possible candidates:
- NARWH (but W is uncommon)
- NARCI (but C is excluded)
- NARVI (V is possible)
- NARMI (M is possible)

But these might not be valid. Let me try NARVI - but this seems unlikely.

Another approach: Maybe the word is N A R I _ with a valid letter. Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with N and containing A,R,I.

Valid word: NARWH (a type of whale) - but this is obscure.

Alternatively, maybe the word is N A _ R I or N A _ I R, etc.

Let me try N A I R _ - but this is 4 letters plus one more.

This suggests I might have made an error in assuming N must be in position 1. Let me re-examine:

From DRAIN feedback:
- N is in the word but not in position 5. So N can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

From CRANK:
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Thus N can be in positions 1,2,3.

From SLATE:
- No info on N position.

So N could be in positions 1,2,3.

Let me re-examine possible positions:

We have letters A,R,N,I to place in the word, and one more letter.

But the word is 5 letters, so we need one more letter not yet used. Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try to construct a word with N in position 2:

N _ A R I → but this would be N _ A R I, which is 5 letters. The missing letter must be in position 3. But A is already in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3 from SLATE feedback). So this is invalid.

N _ R A I → R in position 3, A in position 4 (allowed), I in 5 (allowed). The missing letter is in position 2. Possible letters: from remaining (B,F,G,H,J,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z). Let's pick M: N M R A I → but this isn't a valid word.

N _ R I A → I in 4 (not allowed), so invalid.

N _ A I R → A in 3 (not allowed), invalid.

N _ I A R → A in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed), I in 3 (allowed). Missing letter in position 2: N I A R ? but this is 4 letters.

This seems tricky. Let me try N in position 3:

_ _ N _ _ with A,R,I in remaining positions.

But positions:
- A not in 3 (already)
- R not in 2
- I not in 4

Possible arrangements:
- R A N I _ → but this is 4 letters.
- A R N I _ → 4 letters.

This suggests I need to include one more letter. Let me try:

N A R I _ with a valid letter. The word ""NARWH"" is valid but uncommon.

Alternatively, ""NARCI"" is invalid (C excluded).

""NARMI"" - not a word.

""NARVI"" - not a word.

""NARDO"" - but D is excluded.

""NARBO"" - B is possible, but not a word.

""NARCO"" - C excluded.

""NARCO"" invalid.

""NARWH"" seems to be the only possible, but it's obscure.

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""NINJA"" - but this has N twice, and we don't know if N is allowed to repeat.

""NINJA"" has:
- N in positions 1 and 2
- I in 3
- J in 4
- A in 5

But we have no info on J yet. Let's check constraints:
- A: position 5 (allowed, not 3)
- R: not in 2 (here R is in 3, allowed)
- N: in word, positions 1 and 2 (allowed, not 4 or 5)
- I: position 3 (allowed, not 4)
- J: new letter

This seems valid. But does ""NINJA"" contain R? No, it doesn't. So this violates our earlier conclusion that R is in the word.

Thus, ""NINJA"" is invalid.

Another approach: Since we have A,R,N,I to place, and one more letter, let's try:

N A I R _ → but this is 4 letters.

""N A I _ R"" → but this is 5 letters: N A I _ R. The missing letter in position 4 must be from remaining. But I is already in 3, A in 2, N in 1, R in 5. This would be N A I ? R. Possible letter: M → N A I M R - not a word.

""N I A R _"" → N I A R ? - but this is 4 letters.

This seems impossible with common words. Let me try ""NARWH"" even if obscure.

""NARWH"" has:
- N A R W H
- A in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (allowed, not 2)
- W new letter
- H new letter
- N in 1 (allowed)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

But to be safe, let me try ""NARWH"" as the guess.Based on the feedback, we know the word contains A, R, N, I and does not contain S, L, T, E, C, K, D. The only remaining common consonants are B, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. The most plausible 5-letter word that fits these constraints is ""NARWH"" (a type of whale), even though it's uncommon.

From the four guesses:

1. SLATE → A is in the word but not in position 3.
2. CRANK → R is in the word but not in position 2, N is in the word but not in position 4.
3. DRAIN → R is in the word but not in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, I is in the word but not in position 4, N is in the word but not in position 5.
4. NARWH → A is in position 2 (✓), N is in the word but not in position 1, R is in the word but not in position 3, W and H are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 2), R, N, I
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, T, E, C, K, D, W, H
- Positions ruled out:
  - A: not 3 (from SLATE and DRAIN)
  - R: not 2 (CRANK), not 3 (NARWH)
  - N: not 1 (NARWH), not 4 (CRANK), not 5 (DRAIN) → N must be in position 3
  - I: not 4 (DRAIN), not 5 (NARWH) → I must be in position 1, 3, or 4
  - But position 3 is taken by N, and position 4 is not allowed for I → I must be in position 1

So the word structure is:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Positions 4 & 5: must contain R and one more letter not yet used

Letters left to place: R and one more consonant from remaining (B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

R must be in position 4 or 5, but not 3 (already N) and not 2 (A), and not 1 (I).

Possible words:
- I A N R _ → need one more letter at position 5
- I A N _ R → need one more letter at position 4

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- IANRG - invalid
- IANRA - invalid
- IANRT - T excluded
- IANRX - X possible, but ""IANRX"" not a word
- IANRY - ""IANRY"" not a word
- IANR_ - nothing common

Alternative: I A N _ R
Possible letters for position 4: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, O, U, V, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- IANFR - no
- IANGR - no
- IANGR - no
- IANJR - no
- IANMR - no
- IANPR - no
- IANBR - ""IANBR"" no
- IANOR - no
- IANUR - no
- IANVR - no

This suggests an error in deduction. Let me re-examine:

From NARWH feedback:
- N is in the word but not in position 1 → N can be 2,3,4,5
- But position 2 is A (✓), so N can be 3,4,5
- From CRANK: N not in 4
- From DRAIN: N not in 5
- Thus N must be in position 3

So word structure:
- 1: ?
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: ?
- 5: ?

Letters to place: R, I, and one more letter (since we've used A,N)

From DRAIN: I is in the word but not in position 4 → I can be 1,3,5
- 3 is N, so I can be 1 or 5
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2,3)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: I in 1
- 1: I
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: R or ?
- 5: R or ?

But we need one more letter. Let's think differently: the word must contain I, A, N, R and one more letter not yet used.

Given positions:
- 2: A
- 3: N
- I must be in 1,4, or 5 (but 4 is not allowed for I) → I in 1 or 5
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2,3)

Let's try I in 1:
- 1: I
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: R
- 5: ?

We need one more letter not yet used. Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Valid word: I A N R ? → ""IANRB"" no, ""IANRG"" no, ""IANRP"" no, ""IANRO"" no, ""IANRM"" no, ""IANRV"" no, ""IANRY"" no, ""IANRG"" no, ""IANRP"" no, ""IANRZ"" no

This seems impossible. Let me try I in 5:
- 1: ?
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: ?
- 5: I

R must be in 1 or 4 (not 2,3, and not 5)
- If R in 1: R A N _ I → need one more letter at 4
  - Valid word: R A N G I → ""RANGI"" (a type of New Zealand garment)
- If R in 4: _ A N R I → need one more letter at 1
  - Possible: B A N R I → ""BANRI"" no, ""FANRI"" no, ""GANRI"" no, etc. - none are words

Thus the most plausible word is ""RANGI"".

Let me verify:
- R: position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- A: position 2 (✓)
- N: position 3 (allowed, not 1,4,5)
- G: new letter
- I: position 5 (allowed, not 4)

This fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must have:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- N in position 3 (only remaining spot allowed)
- I in position 1 or 5 (position 4 is excluded for I)
- R must fit into the remaining spots (positions 1 or 4)
- One additional letter not yet used (common remaining consonants include G, B, F, M, etc.)

The only valid combination that forms a real 5-letter word is ""RANGI"".

  - R: not 2 (CRANK), not 3 (NARWH)
  - N: not 1 (NARWH), not 4 (CRANK), not 5 (DRAIN) → N must be in position 3
  - I: not 4 (DRAIN), not 5 (NARWH) → I must be in position 1, 3, or 4
  - But position 3 is taken by N, and position 4 is not allowed for I → I must be in position 1

So the word structure is:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: N
- Positions 4 & 5: must contain R and one more letter not yet used

Letters left to place: R and one more consonant from remaining (B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z)

R must be in position 4 or 5, but not 3 (already N) and not 2 (A), and not 1 (I).

Possible words:
- I A N R _ → need one more letter at position 5
- I A N _ R → need one more letter at position 4

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- IANRG - invalid
- IANRA - invalid
- IANRT - T excluded
- IANRX - X possible, but ""IANRX"" not a word
- IANRY - ""IANRY"" not a word
- IANR_ - nothing common

Alternative: I A N _ R
Possible letters for position 4: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, O, U, V, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- IANFR - no
- IANGR - no
- IANGR - no
- IANJR - no
- IANMR - no
- IANPR - no
- IANBR - ""IANBR"" no
- IANOR - no
- IANUR - no
- IANVR - no

This suggests an error in deduction. Let me re-examine:

From NARWH feedback:
- N is in the word but not in position 1 → N can be 2,3,4,5
- But position 2 is A (✓), so N can be 3,4,5
- From CRANK: N not in 4
- From DRAIN: N not in 5
- Thus N must be in position 3

So word structure:
- 1: ?
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: ?
- 5: ?

Letters to place: R, I, and one more letter (since we've used A,N)

From DRAIN: I is in the word but not in position 4 → I can be 1,3,5
- 3 is N, so I can be 1 or 5
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2,3)

Possible combinations:
Case 1: I in 1
- 1: I
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: R or ?
- 5: R or ?

But we need one more letter. Let's think differently: the word must contain I, A, N, R and one more letter not yet used.

Given positions:
- 2: A
- 3: N
- I must be in 1,4, or 5 (but 4 is not allowed for I) → I in 1 or 5
- R must be in 1,4, or 5 (not 2,3)

Let's try I in 1:
- 1: I
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: R
- 5: ?

We need one more letter not yet used. Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Valid word: I A N R ? → ""IANRB"" no, ""IANRG"" no, ""IANRP"" no, ""IANRO"" no, ""IANRM"" no, ""IANRV"" no, ""IANRY"" no, ""IANRG"" no, ""IANRP"" no, ""IANRZ"" no

This seems impossible. Let me try I in 5:
- 1: ?
- 2: A
- 3: N
- 4: ?
- 5: I

R must be in 1 or 4 (not 2,3, and not 5)
- If R in 1: R A N _ I → need one more letter at 4
  - Valid word: R A N G I → ""RANGI"" (a type of New Zealand garment)
- If R in 4: _ A N R I → need one more letter at 1
  - Possible: B A N R I → ""BANRI"" no, ""FANRI"" no, ""GANRI"" no, etc. - none are words

Thus the most plausible word is ""RANGI"".

Let me verify:
- R: position 1 (allowed, not 2 or 3)
- A: position 2 (✓)
- N: position 3 (allowed, not 1,4,5)
- G: new letter
- I: position 5 (allowed, not 4)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, the word must have:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- N in position 3 (only remaining spot allowed)
- I in position 1 or 5 (position 4 is excluded for I)
- R must fit into the remaining spots (positions 1 or 4)
- One additional letter not yet used (common remaining consonants include G, B, F, M, etc.)

The only valid combination that forms a real 5-letter word is ""RANGI"".",Guess 5: RANGI -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) G(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
