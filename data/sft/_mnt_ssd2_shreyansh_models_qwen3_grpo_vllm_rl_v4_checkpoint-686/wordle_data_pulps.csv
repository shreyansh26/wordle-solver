### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about letter positions.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
- S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1, so S must be in 2 or 3)
- Also, the letters that were marked “-” for S mean S is in the word but not in those positions.  
  In AROSE, S was in position 4 → wrong place.  
  In STING, S was in position 1 → wrong place.  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining unused vowels: U (the only vowel not yet tried).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S exactly once, and only in position 2 or 3
- contains no A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G
- uses other letters we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and build a word:
- _ S _ _ _

Good candidates that fit:
- BUSHY → but H and Y are new, U is new vowel, S in position 2.  
  Letters: B, S, U, H, Y – none of the excluded ones.  
  This seems like a strong third guess.

Another possibility is “CUSPY” (C, U, S, P, Y) but S is in position 3 here, and we haven’t ruled out position 3 yet. Both positions 2 and 3 are still possible for S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about letter positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 4, the secret word must have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U.

A balanced word could be ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing a new position for S).
- O is excluded (from feedback), so this is bad.

Next option: ""SINUS"":
- S in positions 1 and 4 (but 4 is excluded), and position 2 and 3 are I and N.
But this repeats S and may not help much.

Better: ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are new letters.
But E is excluded, so this is fine.

Another good option: ""SULKY"":
- S in position 1.
- U, L, K, Y are new letters.

I'll go with ""STING"" as it tests S in position 1 and brings in T, I, N, G.

<|im_end|>

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
- S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1, so S must be in 2 or 3)
- Also, the letters that were marked “-” for S mean S is in the word but not in those positions.  
  In AROSE, S was in position 4 → wrong place.  
  In STING, S was in position 1 → wrong place.  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining unused vowels: U (the only vowel not yet tried).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S exactly once, and only in position 2 or 3
- contains no A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G
- uses other letters we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and build a word:
- _ S _ _ _

Good candidates that fit:
- BUSHY → but H and Y are new, U is new vowel, S in position 2.  
  Letters: B, S, U, H, Y – none of the excluded ones.  
  This seems like a strong third guess.

Another possibility is “CUSPY” (C, U, S, P, Y) but S is in position 3 here, and we haven’t ruled out position 3 yet. Both positions 2 and 3 are still possible for S.

I’ll go with BUSHY because it tests S in position 2 and introduces B, U, H, Y – all new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback about letter positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since S was in position 4, the secret word must have S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U.

A balanced word could be ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (testing a new position for S).
- O is excluded (from feedback), so this is bad.

Next option: ""SINUS"":
- S in positions 1 and 4 (but 4 is excluded), and position 2 and 3 are I and N.
But this repeats S and may not help much.

Better: ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are new letters.
But E is excluded, so this is fine.

Another good option: ""SULKY"":
- S in position 1.
- U, L, K, Y are new letters.

I'll go with ""STING"" as it tests S in position 1 and brings in T, I, N, G.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:
- S (from both guesses, it was in position 4 then 1, so S must be in 2 or 3)
- Also, the letters that were marked “-” for S mean S is in the word but not in those positions.  
  In AROSE, S was in position 4 → wrong place.  
  In STING, S was in position 1 → wrong place.  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining unused vowels: U (the only vowel not yet tried).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S exactly once, and only in position 2 or 3
- contains no A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G
- uses other letters we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s try placing S in position 2 and build a word:
- _ S _ _ _

Good candidates that fit:
- BUSHY → but H and Y are new, U is new vowel, S in position 2.  
  Letters: B, S, U, H, Y – none of the excluded ones.  
  This seems like a strong third guess.

Another possibility is “CUSPY” (C, U, S, P, Y) but S is in position 3 here, and we haven’t ruled out position 3 yet. Both positions 2 and 3 are still possible for S.

I’ll go with BUSHY because it tests S in position 2 and introduces B, U, H, Y – all new letters.

Guess 3: BUSHY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, B, H, Y

Letters known TO be in the word:  
- U (✓ in position 2)  
- S (must be in the word; positions 1, 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out for S, so S must be in position 2. But position 2 is already taken by U. This is a contradiction, meaning my earlier assumption was wrong.)

Wait, let's re-examine the S feedback carefully:

1. AROSE: S in position 4 → wrong place (-)  
2. STING: S in position 1 → wrong place (-)  
3. BUSHY: S in position 3 → wrong place (-)

So far S has been tried in positions 1, 3, 4 and all were marked (-).  
The only remaining position for S is position 5.

Thus, the word must be: _ U _ _ S

Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):  
C, D, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not listed above)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S with U in position 2.  
Common endings for 5-letter words:  
- ...US (but we need S at position 5)  
- ..._US

Possible words:  
- DUMPS (D, U, M, P, S) – all letters allowed  
- LUMPS (L, U, M, P, S) – all letters allowed  
- CUPID – but I is excluded  
- PUPIL – I excluded  
- LURKS – K allowed, but ends in S? No, ends in S but K is position 5, needs S at 5  
- LURCH – ends in H, excluded  
- LURID – ends in D, but I excluded  

The best candidates are DUMPS or LUMPS. Both fit _ U _ _ S and use allowed letters.

Let's choose DUMPS as it tests D, M, P.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   ⇒ S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   ⇒ S is not in positions 1, 3, 4 (since it was marked “-” in 1 and 3, and already known “-” in 4).  
   Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.

3. BUSHY → B(x) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)  
   ⇒ U is fixed in position 2.  
   S is not in position 3.

4. DUMPS → D(x) U(✓) M(x) P(✓) S(✓)  
   ⇒ U is confirmed in position 2.  
   P is confirmed in position 4.  
   S is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:  
_ U _ P S

Letters already ruled out:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, B, H, Y, D, M

Remaining letters that can fill position 3:  
C, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word matching: _ U ? P S

Possible candidates:  
- LUPUS – but U is already in position 2, so LUPUS would be L U P U S, which has U twice (position 2 and 4). The feedback for P was ✓ in position 4, so P is fixed there. The word would need U only once.  
- JUPES – J, U, P, E, S – but E is excluded.  
- KUPAS – K, U, P, A, S – A excluded.  
- LUPAS – A excluded.  
- LURPS – R excluded.  
- LUTPS – T excluded.  
- LUVPS – V allowed.  
- LUVPS is not a valid English word.  
- LUNPS – N excluded.  
- LURPS – R excluded.  
- LUVPS – invalid.  
- LUPES – E excluded.  
- LUPAS – A excluded.  
- LURPS – R excluded.  
- LUVPS – invalid.  
- LUPUS – L U P U S. This has U in position 2 and 4, but P is confirmed in position 4. The word would be L U P U S. This is a valid English word (meaning a type of lizard).  

Let's check letters: L, U, P, U, S.  
- L: not excluded.  
- U: confirmed in position 2.  
- P: confirmed in position 4.  
- S: confirmed in position 5.  
- Second U: allowed since U can appear twice, and no feedback rules that out.

Thus, the only remaining candidate is LUPUS.
