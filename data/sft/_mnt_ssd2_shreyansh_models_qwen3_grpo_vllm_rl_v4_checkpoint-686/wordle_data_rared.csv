### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and provides valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- A (must be in position 3, from EARLY feedback: A(✓))
- R (must be in position 3 or 4, since it was ""in word but wrong position"" in both guesses; but from EARLY, R is in position 3 and got ""✓"", so R is in position 3)
Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-express:

From AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
From EARLY: A(✓) means A is in correct position 3.

So A is locked in position 3.

From AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
From EARLY: R(✓) means R is in correct position 3.

But A is already in position 3, so R cannot be in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait, re-reading:
AROSE feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
EARLY feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)

So:
- A is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))

This is impossible because a position cannot have two different letters. This suggests I must have misread the symbols.

Ah! I realize now: in the feedback, each position's symbol applies to that specific letter in that specific position. So in EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3

But this contradicts the earlier AROSE feedback where A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1.

Wait, no - in AROSE:
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1
R(-) means R is in word but not position 2
O(x) means O is not in word
S(x) means S is not in word
E(-) means E is in word but not position 5

In EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3
L(x) means L is not in word
Y(x) means Y is not in word

So now we have:
Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))
- E is in word but not position 1 or 5 (from both rounds)

Confirmed absent letters: O, S, L, Y

So the word has structure: _ A R _ _
With remaining letters to determine: positions 1, 4, 5
And we know E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but positions 2 and 3 are taken by A and R, so E must be in position 4 or 5. But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 4.

Thus tentative word: _ A R E _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded (not O, S, L, Y).

Possible remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We want common consonants. Let's think of 5-letter words fitting _ A R E _.

Possible candidates: C A R E _ (but needs 5 letters), D A R E _, F A R E _, etc.

Looking at English words:
- C A R E D
- C A R E S (but S is excluded)
- F A R E D
- M A R E D
- P A R E D
- T A R E D

All of these fit _ A R E _ with valid letters (no O, S, L, Y).

Let's pick ""CARED"" as it uses C and D which are common and haven't been excluded.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1 or 5)
- Letters O, S, L, Y are not in the word

This gives us the pattern: _ A R E _

A common word fitting this is ""CARED"".

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-express:

From AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
From EARLY: A(✓) means A is in correct position 3.

So A is locked in position 3.

From AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
From EARLY: R(✓) means R is in correct position 3.

But A is already in position 3, so R cannot be in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait, re-reading:
AROSE feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
EARLY feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)

So:
- A is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))

This is impossible because a position cannot have two different letters. This suggests I must have misread the symbols.

Ah! I realize now: in the feedback, each position's symbol applies to that specific letter in that specific position. So in EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3

But this contradicts the earlier AROSE feedback where A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1.

Wait, no - in AROSE:
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1
R(-) means R is in word but not position 2
O(x) means O is not in word
S(x) means S is not in word
E(-) means E is in word but not position 5

In EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3
L(x) means L is not in word
Y(x) means Y is not in word

So now we have:
Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))
- E is in word but not position 1 or 5 (from both rounds)

Confirmed absent letters: O, S, L, Y

So the word has structure: _ A R _ _
With remaining letters to determine: positions 1, 4, 5
And we know E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but positions 2 and 3 are taken by A and R, so E must be in position 4 or 5. But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 4.

Thus tentative word: _ A R E _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded (not O, S, L, Y).

Possible remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We want common consonants. Let's think of 5-letter words fitting _ A R E _.

Possible candidates: C A R E _ (but needs 5 letters), D A R E _, F A R E _, etc.

Looking at English words:
- C A R E D
- C A R E S (but S is excluded)
- F A R E D
- M A R E D
- P A R E D
- T A R E D

All of these fit _ A R E _ with valid letters (no O, S, L, Y).

Let's pick ""CARED"" as it uses C and D which are common and haven't been excluded.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and provides valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- A (must be in position 3, from EARLY feedback: A(✓))
- R (must be in position 3 or 4, since it was ""in word but wrong position"" in both guesses; but from EARLY, R is in position 3 and got ""✓"", so R is in position 3)
Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-express:

From AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
From EARLY: A(✓) means A is in correct position 3.

So A is locked in position 3.

From AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
From EARLY: R(✓) means R is in correct position 3.

But A is already in position 3, so R cannot be in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait, re-reading:
AROSE feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
EARLY feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)

So:
- A is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))

This is impossible because a position cannot have two different letters. This suggests I must have misread the symbols.

Ah! I realize now: in the feedback, each position's symbol applies to that specific letter in that specific position. So in EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3

But this contradicts the earlier AROSE feedback where A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1.

Wait, no - in AROSE:
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1
R(-) means R is in word but not position 2
O(x) means O is not in word
S(x) means S is not in word
E(-) means E is in word but not position 5

In EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3
L(x) means L is not in word
Y(x) means Y is not in word

So now we have:
Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))
- E is in word but not position 1 or 5 (from both rounds)

Confirmed absent letters: O, S, L, Y

So the word has structure: _ A R _ _
With remaining letters to determine: positions 1, 4, 5
And we know E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but positions 2 and 3 are taken by A and R, so E must be in position 4 or 5. But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 4.

Thus tentative word: _ A R E _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded (not O, S, L, Y).

Possible remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We want common consonants. Let's think of 5-letter words fitting _ A R E _.

Possible candidates: C A R E _ (but needs 5 letters), D A R E _, F A R E _, etc.

Looking at English words:
- C A R E D
- C A R E S (but S is excluded)
- F A R E D
- M A R E D
- P A R E D
- T A R E D

All of these fit _ A R E _ with valid letters (no O, S, L, Y).

Let's pick ""CARED"" as it uses C and D which are common and haven't been excluded.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1 or 5)
- Letters O, S, L, Y are not in the word

This gives us the pattern: _ A R E _

A common word fitting this is ""CARED"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and provides valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
Letters to keep: A, R, E
Letters to avoid: O, S
Positions to avoid:
- A cannot be 1st
- R cannot be 2nd
- E cannot be 5th

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does not contain O or S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has R not in position 2
5. Has E not in position 5

Possible candidates: RATIO (but has O), REACT (but has S), REBAR (but has S), etc. 
Looking for words with A, R, E and avoiding O/S.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains E, A, R
- Does not contain O or S
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 5 is forbidden for E)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since only position 1 is forbidden for A)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since only position 2 is forbidden for R)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and provides valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
Letters to keep: A, R, E
Letters to avoid: O, S
Positions to avoid:
- A cannot be 1st
- R cannot be 2nd
- E cannot be 5th

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E
2. Does not contain O or S
3. Has A not in position 1
4. Has R not in position 2
5. Has E not in position 5

Possible candidates: RATIO (but has O), REACT (but has S), REBAR (but has S), etc. 
Looking for words with A, R, E and avoiding O/S.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains E, A, R
- Does not contain O or S
- E is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 5 is forbidden for E)
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since only position 1 is forbidden for A)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since only position 2 is forbidden for R)

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- A (must be in position 3, from EARLY feedback: A(✓))
- R (must be in position 3 or 4, since it was ""in word but wrong position"" in both guesses; but from EARLY, R is in position 3 and got ""✓"", so R is in position 3)
Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me re-express:

From AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
From EARLY: A(✓) means A is in correct position 3.

So A is locked in position 3.

From AROSE: R(-) means R is in word but not position 2.
From EARLY: R(✓) means R is in correct position 3.

But A is already in position 3, so R cannot be in position 3. This implies a contradiction unless I misread.

Wait, re-reading:
AROSE feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
EARLY feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)

So:
- A is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))

This is impossible because a position cannot have two different letters. This suggests I must have misread the symbols.

Ah! I realize now: in the feedback, each position's symbol applies to that specific letter in that specific position. So in EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3

But this contradicts the earlier AROSE feedback where A(-) meant A is in word but not position 1.

Wait, no - in AROSE:
A(-) means A is in word but not position 1
R(-) means R is in word but not position 2
O(x) means O is not in word
S(x) means S is not in word
E(-) means E is in word but not position 5

In EARLY:
E(-) means E is in word but not position 1
A(✓) means A is in correct position 2
R(✓) means R is in correct position 3
L(x) means L is not in word
Y(x) means Y is not in word

So now we have:
Confirmed letters and positions:
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY: A(✓))
- R is in correct position 3 (from EARLY: R(✓))
- E is in word but not position 1 or 5 (from both rounds)

Confirmed absent letters: O, S, L, Y

So the word has structure: _ A R _ _
With remaining letters to determine: positions 1, 4, 5
And we know E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4, but positions 2 and 3 are taken by A and R, so E must be in position 4 or 5. But E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-) in position 5), so E must be in position 4.

Thus tentative word: _ A R E _

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 5 with letters not yet excluded (not O, S, L, Y).

Possible remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We want common consonants. Let's think of 5-letter words fitting _ A R E _.

Possible candidates: C A R E _ (but needs 5 letters), D A R E _, F A R E _, etc.

Looking at English words:
- C A R E D
- C A R E S (but S is excluded)
- F A R E D
- M A R E D
- P A R E D
- T A R E D

All of these fit _ A R E _ with valid letters (no O, S, L, Y).

Let's pick ""CARED"" as it uses C and D which are common and haven't been excluded.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3
- E must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1 or 5)
- Letters O, S, L, Y are not in the word

This gives us the pattern: _ A R E _

A common word fitting this is ""CARED"".

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - O and S are not in the word

2. EARLY → E(-) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(x)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)
   - L and Y are not in the word

3. CARED → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)
   - C is not in the word
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - D is in position 5 (✓)

So the confirmed structure is: _ A R E D

Only the first letter is unknown. From previous feedback, we know:
- The word does not contain C, O, L, S, Y
- The word must contain A, R, E, D in positions 2-5
- The first letter must be a consonant not yet used (not C, O, L, S, Y)

Common consonants not yet used: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in ""ARED"":
- BARED
- FARED (not a common word)
- GARED (not a word)
- HARED (not a word)
- MARED (not a word)
- PARED
- TARED

""BARED"" and ""PARED"" are valid. ""BARED"" is more common.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BARED"".

We now know the word is exactly _ A R E D, and the first letter has been tested against B, C, T (and previously ruled out A, O, L, S, Y).  
Letters still allowed for the first position (common consonants) are: F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, etc.

The only common English word that fits _ A R E D and hasn’t been tried yet is “FARED” (though it’s not standard), but the actual valid word is “HARED” (also non-standard). The correct and only standard word left is “MARED” (not valid), “NARED” (not valid), “PARED” (not yet tried).

Wait—let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in “ARED”:
- BARED (already tried, B ruled out)
- CARED (C ruled out)
- FARED (not a dictionary word)
- GARED (not a word)
- HARED (not a word)
- JARED (proper noun, usually not allowed)
- KARED (not a word)
- MARED (not a word)
- NARED (not a word)
- PARED (valid word, not yet tried)
- SARED (S ruled out)
- TARED (T ruled out)
- WARED (valid word, not yet tried)
- ZARED (not a word)

So the remaining valid guesses are “PARED” and “WARED”. Between these, “PARED” is more common.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “PARED”.
