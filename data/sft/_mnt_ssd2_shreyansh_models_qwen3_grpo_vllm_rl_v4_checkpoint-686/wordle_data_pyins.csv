For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible, ideally without repeating any letters to cover more ground.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" or ""STARE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O instead of another S. I'll go with AROSE as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).

- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is again marked “-”, so it’s still not in position 1.  
   – L, U, M are not in the word.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, L, U, M

Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown):  
S and P

So the secret word must contain both S and P, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- S is not in position 1 or 4.  
- P is not in position 5.

Let’s pick a word that places S and P in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
A good candidate is “SPICY”:
- S in position 1 → but feedback already told us S is not in position 1.  
So SPICY is invalid.

Next candidate: “PISTY” – but T and Y are allowed, yet S is in position 3 (allowed) and P in position 2 (allowed).  
However, “PISTY” is uncommon.

Better: “STING” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SWISH” – too long.

Try “SHIFT”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SPINS” – repeats S.

Try “PISOT” – but O is forbidden.

Try “SPICY” already ruled out.

Try “SPICY” again – no.

Let’s systematically construct:
We need S and P plus three other allowed letters, avoiding positions 1 and 4 for S, 5 for P.

Put S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ _  
P must go in 3, 4, or 2 (but 2 is taken by S). So P in 3 or 4.

Try “CSPID” – not a word.

Try “BSPIN” – not a word.

Try “PSYCH” – but C, H allowed.

“PSYCH”:
- P in 1 (allowed, since we only know P is not in 5).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- Y, C, H are all allowed letters.  
“PSYCH” is a valid English word.

Let’s pick a word that places S and P in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
A good candidate is “SPICY”:
- S in position 1 → but feedback already told us S is not in position 1.  
So SPICY is invalid.

Next candidate: “PISTY” – but T and Y are allowed, yet S is in position 3 (allowed) and P in position 2 (allowed).  
However, “PISTY” is uncommon.

Better: “STING” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SWISH” – too long.

Try “SHIFT”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SPINS” – repeats S.

Try “PISOT” – but O is forbidden.

Try “SPICY” already ruled out.

Try “SPICY” again – no.

Let’s systematically construct:
We need S and P plus three other allowed letters, avoiding positions 1 and 4 for S, 5 for P.

Put S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ _  
P must go in 3, 4, or 2 (but 2 is taken by S). So P in 3 or 4.

Try “CSPID” – not a word.

Try “BSPIN” – not a word.

Try “PSYCH” – but C, H allowed.

“PSYCH”:
- P in 1 (allowed, since we only know P is not in 5).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- Y, C, H are all allowed letters.  
“PSYCH” is a valid English word.

This seems like a good third guess.

- Cannot contain: A, R, O, E, L, U, M, C, H  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4  
- Y cannot be in position 3

Available letters (excluding forbidden ones):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing S and Y, with S not in 1,2,4 and Y not in 3.  
Possible positions for S: 3 or 5  
Possible positions for Y: 2, 4, 5

Let’s consider S in position 3 and Y in position 2:  
Pattern: P Y S _ _  
Need two more letters from allowed set, not repeating P,Y,S.  
Possible: P Y S T _ – but T is allowed.  
“P Y S T _” → “P Y S T I” → “P Y S T N” – but “P Y S T _” doesn’t form a word.

“P Y N D S” – not a word.  
“P Y N I S” – “PYNIS” – not valid.

Try S in position 3 and Y in position 2:  
“P Y S T _” – no valid word.

Wait, let’s list possible words starting with P, containing S and Y, with constraints.

Possible valid English words starting with P and containing S and Y:
- PYSKY – but K is allowed, Y in 2, S in 3, K in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
P(✓) Y(-) S(-) K _ Y(-)  
But feedback said Y is in word but not in position 3 (which it isn’t here), but we don’t have info on K yet.  
However, PYSKY has Y in positions 2 and 5 – but we only know one Y exists.  
Also, S in position 3 is allowed (not forbidden).

But is PYSKY a valid word? Yes.

Check constraints:
- P is in position 1 (✓)  
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,2,4)  
- Y is in position 2 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- K is allowed (not forbidden)  
- Second Y in position 5 – but we only know one Y exists. However, the feedback only told us Y is in word but not in position 3, so it could appear twice.  
But let’s see if there’s a word with single Y.

Another candidate: PISTY – but I is allowed, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- P(✓) I _ S T Y  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- I and T are allowed  
- No forbidden letters  

PISTY is a valid word (though uncommon).

Between PYSKY and PISTY, PISTY seems better as it has single Y and more common letters.

But let’s verify:  
P I S T Y  
Positions:  
1: P (✓)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: S (allowed, not in 1,2,4)  
4: T (allowed)

No forbidden letters used. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PISTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible, ideally without repeating any letters to cover more ground.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" or ""STARE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O instead of another S. I'll go with AROSE as the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the secret word contains an S somewhere other than the 4th position and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in the 4th spot).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Looking at the remaining common letters (excluding A, R, O, E):  
Consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J  
Vowels left: I, U

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- L, U, M, P are all allowed letters (not in the forbidden set).
- It uses U (a common vowel) and several other common consonants.

Another candidate could be “STUMP” or “SPILL”, but “SLUMP” gives a good mix of remaining common letters.

I’ll go with SLUMP.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is again marked “-”, so it’s still not in position 1.  
   – L, U, M are not in the word.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, L, U, M

Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown):  
S and P

So the secret word must contain both S and P, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- S is not in position 1 or 4.  
- P is not in position 5.

Let’s pick a word that places S and P in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
A good candidate is “SPICY”:
- S in position 1 → but feedback already told us S is not in position 1.  
So SPICY is invalid.

Next candidate: “PISTY” – but T and Y are allowed, yet S is in position 3 (allowed) and P in position 2 (allowed).  
However, “PISTY” is uncommon.

Better: “STING” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SWISH” – too long.

Try “SHIFT”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SPINS” – repeats S.

Try “PISOT” – but O is forbidden.

Try “SPICY” already ruled out.

Try “SPICY” again – no.

Let’s systematically construct:
We need S and P plus three other allowed letters, avoiding positions 1 and 4 for S, 5 for P.

Put S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ _  
P must go in 3, 4, or 2 (but 2 is taken by S). So P in 3 or 4.

Try “CSPID” – not a word.

Try “BSPIN” – not a word.

Try “PSYCH” – but C, H allowed.

“PSYCH”:
- P in 1 (allowed, since we only know P is not in 5).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- Y, C, H are all allowed letters.  
“PSYCH” is a valid English word.

- Y is in position 2 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- K is allowed (not forbidden)  
- Second Y in position 5 – but we only know one Y exists. However, the feedback only told us Y is in word but not in position 3, so it could appear twice.  
But let’s see if there’s a word with single Y.

Another candidate: PISTY – but I is allowed, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- P(✓) I _ S T Y  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- I and T are allowed  
- No forbidden letters  

PISTY is a valid word (though uncommon).

Between PYSKY and PISTY, PISTY seems better as it has single Y and more common letters.

But let’s verify:  
P I S T Y  
Positions:  
1: P (✓)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: S (allowed, not in 1,2,4)  
4: T (allowed)  
5: Y (allowed, not in 3)  

No forbidden letters used. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PISTY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Known facts
- Word is exactly 5 letters and starts with P (position 1 is locked).
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: P (already placed), S, Y.
- Letters that CANNOT appear at all: A, R, O, E, L, U, M, C, H, T.
- Position restrictions:
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from feedback on AROSE, SLUMP, PSYCH, PISTY).
  – Y cannot be in positions 3, 5 (from PSYCH and PISTY feedback).
  – I cannot be in position 2 (from PISTY feedback).

So S must be in position 3 or 5, and Y must be in position 2 or 4.

Possible patterns
1. P Y S _ _  (Y in 2, S in 3)  
   Need two more letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Common consonants: B, D, F, G, N, K  
   Try to form real words:  
   - P Y S B _ → no common word  
   - P Y S T _ → T is forbidden  
   - P Y S K _ → PYSKI? Not a word  
   - P Y S N _ → PYSN? Not valid  

2. P _ S Y _  (S in 3, Y in 4)  
   Need letters for positions 2 and 5.  
   Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

   - P B S Y N → Pbsyn? Not a word  
   - P N S Y K → Pnsyk? Not a word  
   - P D S Y N → Pdsyn? Not a word  

3. P _ _ S Y  (S in 4, Y in 5)  
   But S is forbidden in position 4 (from AROSE feedback). So this pattern is impossible.

4. P Y _ S _  (Y in 2, S in 4) – S forbidden in 4, skip.

5. P _ Y S _  (Y in 3) – Y forbidden in 3, skip.

6. P _ _ Y S  (Y in 4, S in 5)  
   This satisfies:  
   - S in 5 (allowed)  
   - Y in 4 (allowed)  
   Need letters for positions 2 and 3.  
   Possible combinations:  
   - P N I Y S → Pn iys? Not a word  
   - P N D Y S → Pndys? Not a word  
   - P N G Y S → Pngys? Not a word  
   - P N B Y S → Pnbys? Not a word  

   Wait, let’s try real dictionary words:  
   - P N I Y S → no  
   - P N D Y S → no  
   - P N G Y S → no  

   Try P B N Y S → Pbnys? No.  

   Try P N I S Y → Pnis y? No.  

   Try P N I D Y → Pni dy? No.  

   This path seems stuck.

7. P _ _ _ Y  (Y in 5) – but Y must appear at least once and we already have Y in position 2 or 4, so this would require two Y’s.  
   P _ _ _ Y with another Y somewhere:  
   - P Y _ _ Y → but Y in 2 and 5, need S in 3 or 4.  
   - P Y S _ Y → P Y S _ Y → need a letter in 4.  
     Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
     Try P Y S B Y → Pysby? Not a word  
     P Y S K Y → Pysky? This is a real word (“pysanky” is a thing, “pysky” is variant).  
     Check constraints:  
     - P(✓) Y(-) S(-) K _ Y(-)  
     - Y appears twice – feedback only said “Y is in the word but not in position 3”, so double Y is allowed.  
     - S is in 3 (allowed)  
     - K is allowed  
     - No forbidden letters  

   PYSKY fits all constraints.

Let’s verify no better single-Y option was missed, but the only plausible English word fitting all constraints is PYSKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains as many of these common letters as possible, ideally without repeating any letters to cover more ground.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a broad coverage of common consonants and vowels. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" or ""STARE"" could also work, but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O instead of another S. I'll go with AROSE as the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the secret word contains an S somewhere other than the 4th position and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in the 4th spot).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Looking at the remaining common letters (excluding A, R, O, E):  
Consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J  
Vowels left: I, U

A good candidate is “SLUMP”:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- L, U, M, P are all allowed letters (not in the forbidden set).
- It uses U (a common vowel) and several other common consonants.

Another candidate could be “STUMP” or “SPILL”, but “SLUMP” gives a good mix of remaining common letters.

I’ll go with SLUMP.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is again marked “-”, so it’s still not in position 1.  
   – L, U, M are not in the word.  
   – P is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, L, U, M

Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown):  
S and P

So the secret word must contain both S and P, and the remaining three letters must come from the still-allowed set:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- S is not in position 1 or 4.  
- P is not in position 5.

Let’s pick a word that places S and P in new positions and uses other common remaining letters.  
A good candidate is “SPICY”:
- S in position 1 → but feedback already told us S is not in position 1.  
So SPICY is invalid.

Next candidate: “PISTY” – but T and Y are allowed, yet S is in position 3 (allowed) and P in position 2 (allowed).  
However, “PISTY” is uncommon.

Better: “STING” – but S is in position 1 (invalid).

Another candidate: “SWISH” – too long.

Try “SHIFT”:
- S in position 1 (invalid).

Try “SPINS” – repeats S.

Try “PISOT” – but O is forbidden.

Try “SPICY” already ruled out.

Try “SPICY” again – no.

Let’s systematically construct:
We need S and P plus three other allowed letters, avoiding positions 1 and 4 for S, 5 for P.

Put S in position 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ _  
P must go in 3, 4, or 2 (but 2 is taken by S). So P in 3 or 4.

Try “CSPID” – not a word.

Try “BSPIN” – not a word.

Try “PSYCH” – but C, H allowed.

“PSYCH”:
- P in 1 (allowed, since we only know P is not in 5).  
- S in 2 (allowed).  
- Y, C, H are all allowed letters.  
“PSYCH” is a valid English word.

This seems like a good third guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word, not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(x) U(x) M(x) P(-)  
   – S is still not in position 1.  
   – P is in the word, not in position 5.

3. PSYCH → P(✓) S(-) Y(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – P is in the correct position (position 1).  
   – S is still not in position 2.  
   – Y is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – C and H are not in the word.

Letters we now know:
- Must contain: P (position 1), S, Y  
- Cannot contain: A, R, O, E, L, U, M, C, H  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4  
- Y cannot be in position 3

Available letters (excluding forbidden ones):  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing S and Y, with S not in 1,2,4 and Y not in 3.  
Possible positions for S: 3 or 5  
Possible positions for Y: 2, 4, 5

Let’s consider S in position 3 and Y in position 2:  
Pattern: P Y S _ _  
Need two more letters from allowed set, not repeating P,Y,S.  
Possible: P Y S T _ – but T is allowed.  
“P Y S T _” → “P Y S T I” → “P Y S T N” – but “P Y S T _” doesn’t form a word.

Try S in position 5 and Y in position 2:  
Pattern: P Y _ _ S  
Need three letters in positions 3,4 from allowed set.  
“P Y N D S” – not a word.  
“P Y N I S” – “PYNIS” – not valid.

Try S in position 3 and Y in position 4:  
Pattern: P _ S Y _  
Need position 2 and 5.  
“P I S Y N” – “PISYN” – not valid.  
“P T S Y N” – “PTSYN” – no.

Try S in position 5 and Y in position 4:  
Pattern: P _ _ Y S  
Need positions 2,3.  
“P I N Y S” – “PINYS” – no.  
“P I G Y S” – “PIGY S” – no.

Try S in position 3 and Y in position 2:  
“P Y S T _” – no valid word.

Wait, let’s list possible words starting with P, containing S and Y, with constraints.

Possible valid English words starting with P and containing S and Y:
- PYSKY – but K is allowed, Y in 2, S in 3, K in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
P(✓) Y(-) S(-) K _ Y(-)  
But feedback said Y is in word but not in position 3 (which it isn’t here), but we don’t have info on K yet.  
However, PYSKY has Y in positions 2 and 5 – but we only know one Y exists.  
Also, S in position 3 is allowed (not forbidden).

But is PYSKY a valid word? Yes.

Check constraints:
- P is in position 1 (✓)  
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,2,4)  
- Y is in position 2 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- K is allowed (not forbidden)  
- Second Y in position 5 – but we only know one Y exists. However, the feedback only told us Y is in word but not in position 3, so it could appear twice.  
But let’s see if there’s a word with single Y.

Another candidate: PISTY – but I is allowed, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.  
Check constraints:  
- P(✓) I _ S T Y  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (allowed, since Y cannot be in 3)  
- I and T are allowed  
- No forbidden letters  

PISTY is a valid word (though uncommon).

Between PYSKY and PISTY, PISTY seems better as it has single Y and more common letters.

But let’s verify:  
P I S T Y  
Positions:  
1: P (✓)  
2: I (allowed)  
3: S (allowed, not in 1,2,4)  
4: T (allowed)  
5: Y (allowed, not in 3)  

No forbidden letters used. This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PISTY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Known facts
- Word is exactly 5 letters and starts with P (position 1 is locked).
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: P (already placed), S, Y.
- Letters that CANNOT appear at all: A, R, O, E, L, U, M, C, H, T.
- Position restrictions:
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from feedback on AROSE, SLUMP, PSYCH, PISTY).
  – Y cannot be in positions 3, 5 (from PSYCH and PISTY feedback).
  – I cannot be in position 2 (from PISTY feedback).

So S must be in position 3 or 5, and Y must be in position 2 or 4.

Possible patterns
1. P Y S _ _  (Y in 2, S in 3)  
   Need two more letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Common consonants: B, D, F, G, N, K  
   Try to form real words:  
   - P Y S B _ → no common word  
   - P Y S T _ → T is forbidden  
   - P Y S K _ → PYSKI? Not a word  
   - P Y S N _ → PYSN? Not valid  

2. P _ S Y _  (S in 3, Y in 4)  
   Need letters for positions 2 and 5.  
   Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Try combinations:  
   - P B S Y N → Pbsyn? Not a word  
   - P N S Y K → Pnsyk? Not a word  
   - P D S Y N → Pdsyn? Not a word  

3. P _ _ S Y  (S in 4, Y in 5)  
   But S is forbidden in position 4 (from AROSE feedback). So this pattern is impossible.

4. P Y _ S _  (Y in 2, S in 4) – S forbidden in 4, skip.

5. P _ Y S _  (Y in 3) – Y forbidden in 3, skip.

6. P _ _ Y S  (Y in 4, S in 5)  
   This satisfies:  
   - S in 5 (allowed)  
   - Y in 4 (allowed)  
   Need letters for positions 2 and 3.  
   Possible combinations:  
   - P N I Y S → Pn iys? Not a word  
   - P N D Y S → Pndys? Not a word  
   - P N G Y S → Pngys? Not a word  
   - P N B Y S → Pnbys? Not a word  

   Wait, let’s try real dictionary words:  
   - P N I Y S → no  
   - P N D Y S → no  
   - P N G Y S → no  

   Try P B N Y S → Pbnys? No.  

   Try P N I S Y → Pnis y? No.  

   Try P N I D Y → Pni dy? No.  

   This path seems stuck.

7. P _ _ _ Y  (Y in 5) – but Y must appear at least once and we already have Y in position 2 or 4, so this would require two Y’s.  
   P _ _ _ Y with another Y somewhere:  
   - P Y _ _ Y → but Y in 2 and 5, need S in 3 or 4.  
   - P Y S _ Y → P Y S _ Y → need a letter in 4.  
     Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Z  
     Try P Y S B Y → Pysby? Not a word  
     P Y S K Y → Pysky? This is a real word (“pysanky” is a thing, “pysky” is variant).  
     Check constraints:  
     - P(✓) Y(-) S(-) K _ Y(-)  
     - Y appears twice – feedback only said “Y is in the word but not in position 3”, so double Y is allowed.  
     - S is in 3 (allowed)  
     - K is allowed  
     - No forbidden letters  

   PYSKY fits all constraints.

Let’s verify no better single-Y option was missed, but the only plausible English word fitting all constraints is PYSKY.

   – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from AROSE, SLUMP, PSYCH, PISTY, PYSKY feedback).
   – Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the only possible word is P Y _ _ S.

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining allowed letters:
Allowed set = {B, D, F, G, I, J, N, Q, V, W, X, Z}  (all other letters are forbidden).

We also have the following constraints:
- I cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied, since I is not in position 2).
- No other positional restrictions on I, B, D, F, G, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter English word of the form PY _ _ S.

None of these combinations form a valid English word. This suggests that our assumption that S must be in position 5 might be missing something, or that the only possible word is a less common one.

However, looking back at the feedback, in PYSKY we got:
- P(✓) Y(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(-)
This means:
- P and Y are correct in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
- K is not in the word.
- The second Y is in the word but not in position 4 (already known).

This does not give us new information about positions 3 and 4. The key point is that S must be in position 5 because it cannot be elsewhere.

Given that, and checking a dictionary, the only valid English word that fits P Y _ _ S is ""PYXES"" (a plural form of ""pyx""), but X and E: E is forbidden. 

Wait, let's double-check:
- PYXES: contains X and E, but E is forbidden.
- PYGMS: but M is forbidden.
- PYGMY: but M is forbidden and it's 5 letters but ends with Y.
- PYXIS: but X and S are allowed, I is allowed. ""PYXIS"" is a valid word (plural of pyxis, a small jar).

Check if ""PYXIS"" fits:
- P Y X I S
- Letters: P, Y, X, I, S
- All letters are allowed (P, Y, S required; X and I are not forbidden).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Y is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.
- No forbidden positions.

Thus, ""PYXIS"" is the correct word.

<guess>PYXIS</guess>",PYXIS,"Let’s list everything we now know after five guesses.

1. Word pattern so far: P Y _ _ _  (P and Y are locked in positions 1 and 2).
2. Letters that MUST appear: P, Y, S.
3. Letters that CANNOT appear: A, R, O, E, L, U, M, C, H, T, K.
4. Position restrictions:
   – S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from AROSE, SLUMP, PSYCH, PISTY, PYSKY feedback).
   – Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the only possible word is P Y _ _ S.

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining allowed letters:
Allowed set = {B, D, F, G, I, J, N, Q, V, W, X, Z}  (all other letters are forbidden).

We also have the following constraints:
- I cannot be in position 2 (already satisfied, since I is not in position 2).
- No other positional restrictions on I, B, D, F, G, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

None of these combinations form a valid English word. This suggests that our assumption that S must be in position 5 might be missing something, or that the only possible word is a less common one.

However, looking back at the feedback, in PYSKY we got:
- P(✓) Y(✓) S(-) K(x) Y(-)
This means:
- P and Y are correct in positions 1 and 2.
- S is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
- K is not in the word.
- The second Y is in the word but not in position 4 (already known).

This does not give us new information about positions 3 and 4. The key point is that S must be in position 5 because it cannot be elsewhere.

Given that, and checking a dictionary, the only valid English word that fits P Y _ _ S is ""PYXES"" (a plural form of ""pyx""), but X and E: E is forbidden. 

Wait, let's double-check:
- PYXES: contains X and E, but E is forbidden.
- PYGMS: but M is forbidden.
- PYGMY: but M is forbidden and it's 5 letters but ends with Y.
- PYXIS: but X and S are allowed, I is allowed. ""PYXIS"" is a valid word (plural of pyxis, a small jar).

Check if ""PYXIS"" fits:
- P Y X I S
- Letters: P, Y, X, I, S
- All letters are allowed (P, Y, S required; X and I are not forbidden).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Y is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.
- No forbidden positions.

Thus, ""PYXIS"" is the correct word.",Guess 6: PYXIS -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) Y(✓) X(x) I(-) S(✓),FAIL
