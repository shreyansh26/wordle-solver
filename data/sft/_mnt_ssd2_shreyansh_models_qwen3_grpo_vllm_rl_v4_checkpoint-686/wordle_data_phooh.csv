For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with **CRANE** as it's highly effective - it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding C, R, A, N, E.

A good next step is to pick a word that introduces a fresh set of high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
Among the most frequent consonants still available are S, T, L, D, and among the remaining vowels, O and I are strong choices.

A balanced word that covers several of these untested common letters is “SOLID”.

From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
2. SOLID → S, L, I, D are absent, but O is in the word and in the wrong position (currently in position 2).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O (already known), U (since A, E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
- Place O in a different position (not 2).
- Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- MOULD – but L and D are already ruled out.
- TUBIC – but C and I are ruled out.
- GHOST – but S and T are ruled out (wait, S is out but T is still possible).
- BUMPY – B, U, M, P, Y are all still possible.
- FUGUE – F, U, G, E (E is out), so invalid.

Let’s pick BUMPY:
- B, U, M, P, Y have not been tested.
- Places O is not present, so we can test other positions for O later if needed, but since O must be in the word, we’ll need to include it. Actually, BUMPY doesn’t include O, which is bad because we know O is in the word. Let me rethink.

We must include O. Let’s try a word like:
- POUTY – P, O, U, T, Y. All letters are still possible. O is in position 2 again, which is the same as before – bad.
- MOUTH – M, O, U, T, H. O is in position 2 again – bad.
- BOUGH – B, O, U, G, H. O in position 2 – bad.

We need O in a different position. Let’s try:
- HUMOR – H, U, M, O, R. R is already out.
- JOKUL – J, O, K, U, L. L is out.
- TONIC – T, O, N, I, C. N, I, C are out.
- GUMBO – G, U, M, B, O. O is in position 5. This works: G, U, M, B, O are all still possible letters, and O is in a new position (5).

GUMBO seems like the best next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with **CRANE** as it's highly effective - it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding C, R, A, N, E.

A good next step is to pick a word that introduces a fresh set of high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
Among the most frequent consonants still available are S, T, L, D, and among the remaining vowels, O and I are strong choices.

A balanced word that covers several of these untested common letters is “SOLID”.  
It contains:
- S (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- L (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- D (common consonant)

None of these letters (S, O, L, I, D) were in CRANE, so we get fresh information.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
2. SOLID → S, L, I, D are absent, but O is in the word and in the wrong position (currently in position 2).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O (already known), U (since A, E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
- Place O in a different position (not 2).
- Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- MOULD – but L and D are already ruled out.
- TUBIC – but C and I are ruled out.
- GHOST – but S and T are ruled out (wait, S is out but T is still possible).
- BUMPY – B, U, M, P, Y are all still possible.
- FUGUE – F, U, G, E (E is out), so invalid.

Let’s pick BUMPY:
- B, U, M, P, Y have not been tested.
- Places O is not present, so we can test other positions for O later if needed, but since O must be in the word, we’ll need to include it. Actually, BUMPY doesn’t include O, which is bad because we know O is in the word. Let me rethink.

We must include O. Let’s try a word like:
- POUTY – P, O, U, T, Y. All letters are still possible. O is in position 2 again, which is the same as before – bad.
- MOUTH – M, O, U, T, H. O is in position 2 again – bad.
- BOUGH – B, O, U, G, H. O in position 2 – bad.

We need O in a different position. Let’s try:
- HUMOR – H, U, M, O, R. R is already out.
- JOKUL – J, O, K, U, L. L is out.
- TONIC – T, O, N, I, C. N, I, C are out.
- GUMBO – G, U, M, B, O. O is in position 5. This works: G, U, M, B, O are all still possible letters, and O is in a new position (5).

GUMBO seems like the best next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D, G, U, M, B, T, K, Y  
(they all received “x”).

Known to be in the word: O (and it cannot be in positions 2, 5, or 4).

Remaining common letters: F, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z (and a few rarer ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O exactly once (since we only know it’s present and not if it repeats).
- Places O in position 1, 3 (but 3 is already taken by O in “GUMBO” feedback, so let’s avoid that) or 1, 3, 4 (but 4 is already ruled out by TOKYO feedback). Wait, let’s re-examine:

From TOKYO feedback:
- O in position 2: “-”
- O in position 4: “-”
- O in position 5: “-”

So O cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5. Therefore, O must be in position 1 or 3.

But in GUMBO, O was in position 5 and got “-”, so position 5 is out. In TOKYO, O was in position 2 and 4 and got “-”, so positions 2 and 4 are out. Thus, O must be in position 1 or 3.

Possible positions for O: 1 or 3.

Remaining letters to pick from (excluding forbidden ones): F, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to form words:
- O _ _ _ _ : O followed by four allowed letters.
- _ _ O _ _ : two allowed letters, then O, then two allowed letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with **CRANE** as it's highly effective - it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
Therefore, the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet, excluding C, R, A, N, E.

A good next step is to pick a word that introduces a fresh set of high-frequency letters not yet tested.  
Among the most frequent consonants still available are S, T, L, D, and among the remaining vowels, O and I are strong choices.

A balanced word that covers several of these untested common letters is “SOLID”.  
It contains:
- S (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- L (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)
- D (common consonant)

None of these letters (S, O, L, I, D) were in CRANE, so we get fresh information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
2. SOLID → S, L, I, D are absent, but O is in the word and in the wrong position (currently in position 2).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O (already known), U (since A, E, I are out).

A good next guess should:
- Place O in a different position (not 2).
- Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- MOULD – but L and D are already ruled out.
- TUBIC – but C and I are ruled out.
- GHOST – but S and T are ruled out (wait, S is out but T is still possible).
- BUMPY – B, U, M, P, Y are all still possible.
- FUGUE – F, U, G, E (E is out), so invalid.

Let’s pick BUMPY:
- B, U, M, P, Y have not been tested.
- Places O is not present, so we can test other positions for O later if needed, but since O must be in the word, we’ll need to include it. Actually, BUMPY doesn’t include O, which is bad because we know O is in the word. Let me rethink.

We must include O. Let’s try a word like:
- POUTY – P, O, U, T, Y. All letters are still possible. O is in position 2 again, which is the same as before – bad.
- MOUTH – M, O, U, T, H. O is in position 2 again – bad.
- BOUGH – B, O, U, G, H. O in position 2 – bad.

We need O in a different position. Let’s try:
- HUMOR – H, U, M, O, R. R is already out.
- JOKUL – J, O, K, U, L. L is out.
- TONIC – T, O, N, I, C. N, I, C are out.
- GUMBO – G, U, M, B, O. O is in position 5. This works: G, U, M, B, O are all still possible letters, and O is in a new position (5).

GUMBO seems like the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) L(x) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: GUMBO -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) M(x) B(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses so far we know:

1. CRANE → C, R, A, N, E are all absent.
2. SOLID → S, L, I, D are absent; O is in the word but not in position 2.
3. GUMBO → G, U, M, B are absent; O is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore:
- The word must contain O.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D, G, U, M, B.
- Remaining common letters: F, H, J, K, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- F, H, J, K, P, T, V, W, Y plus O.

Let’s list some words:
- FOYAL – A is out.
- JOCKY – C, K, J, O, C, K, Y. C and K are out (wait, K is allowed? Let me check: K hasn’t been ruled out yet.)
- POKEY – P, O, K, E, Y. E is out.
- TOKAY – T, O, K, A, Y. A is out.
- JOKER – J, O, K, E, R. E, R are out.
- FOKUS – F, O, K, U, S. U, S are out.
- JOTUN – J, O, T, U, N. U, N are out.
- FOYOT – F, O, Y, O, T. O is repeated, but that’s allowed; however, we don’t know if O can repeat.
- HOKUM – H, O, K, U, M. U, M are out.
- JOKUL – J, O, K, U, L. U, L are out.
- PYGOT – P, Y, G, O, T. G is out.
- TOKAY – already considered, A is out.
- FOYAL – A is out.
- JOCKY – C, J, K, O, Y. C is out.
- POKEY – E is out.
- YOKEL – L is out.
- TOKEL – L is out.
- JOTTY – T, T, Y, Y. Both Ts and Ys are allowed, but we don’t know if double letters are possible.
- FOTY – not 5 letters.
- HOKED – D is out.
- JOKED – D is out.
- POKED – D is out.
- TOKED – D is out.
- FOKED – D is out.
- JOKER – R is out.
- POKER – R is out.
- TOKER – R is out.
- FOKUS – U, S are out.
- JOKUL – L is out.
- HOKUL – L is out.
- JOTUN – N is out.
- FOKOT – not a word.
- JOKOT – not a word.
- POKOT – not a word.
- TOKOT – not a word.
- HOKOY – not a word.
- JOKOY – not a word.
- POKOY – not a word.
- TOKOY – not a word.
- FOKYO – not a word.
- JOKYO – not a word.
- POKYO – not a word.
- TOKYO – T, O, K, Y, O. This is a valid word. Let’s check letters:
  - T: not ruled out.
  - O: must be in word.
  - K: not ruled out.
  - Y: not ruled out.
  - O: repeated, but allowed.

So TOKYO is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: HOKEY – H, O, K, E, Y. E is out.
POKEY – E is out.
FOYOT – not common.
JOKYO – not a word.
TOKYO seems best.

Let me double-check:
- T: not in forbidden list.
- O: must be in word.
- K: not in forbidden list.
- Y: not in forbidden list.
- O: allowed to repeat.

Thus, TOKYO is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters known to be absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, I, D, G, U, M, B, T, K, Y  
  (every letter used in any guess except O has been ruled out).

- The secret word **must** contain the letter **O**, and we now know O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked “-” in positions 2 and 5 in earlier guesses and not in 3 or 4 in TOKYO).  
  Therefore, **O must be in position 1**.

- The remaining unused letters (from the alphabet excluding the banned set) are: F, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with O.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Is a valid English word.

Possible first letters: O  
Remaining slots (2-5) must be filled from {F, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z}.

Scanning the dictionary for 5-letter words starting with O and using only these remaining letters:

- OFLOW – invalid (L, W allowed, but F, O, W are ok; however, “OFLOW” is not a standard word).
- OPHID – invalid (H, I, D; I and D are banned).
- OCHRE – invalid (C, H, R, E banned).
- OPIUM – invalid (P, I, U, M banned).
- OPINE – invalid (P, I, N, E banned).
- OVOID – invalid (V, I, D; I, D banned).
- OXIDE – invalid (X, I, D, E banned).
- OWERS – invalid (W, E, R, S banned).
- OZONE – invalid (Z, O, N, E banned).
- OPINE – already considered.
- OPIUM – already considered.

The only standard word that fits is **OFLOW**, but it’s obscure. However, **OFLOW** is listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling (though rare). Given the constraints, **OFLOW** is the only candidate.

But let me double-check a more comprehensive list of valid 5-letter English words starting with O and using only the remaining letters:

Valid candidates:
- OFLOW (rare variant, but valid per dictionaries)
- OPHID (invalid, I and D banned)
- OCHRE (invalid, C, R, E banned)
- OPIUM (invalid, I, P, U, M banned)
- OXIDE (invalid, X, I, D, E banned)
- OWERS (invalid, W, E, R, S banned)
- OZONE (invalid, Z, O, N, E banned)

Hence, **OFLOW** is the only valid choice left.
