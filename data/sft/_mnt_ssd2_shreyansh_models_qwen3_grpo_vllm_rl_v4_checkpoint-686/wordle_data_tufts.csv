For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- T: correct in position 4
- E: not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word has a T in the 4th position.
- It has an S somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include S in one of positions 2-5.
3. Avoid L, A, E.
4. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- STORM (but T is already fixed at 4, so this would place S in 1 which conflicts with S needing to be in 2-5)
- SHIRT (S in 1 again, no good)
- SPORT (S in 1 again)
- FIRST (S in 1 again)
- CHANT (no S)
- CRUST (S in 5, T in 4, but U and R are new)
- BRUST (same issue with B)
- DRUST (same)

Better option: CRUST
- C, R, U are new letters.
- S in 5 (allowed, since 2-5)
- T in 4 (matches)

Another good one: BRISK
- B, R, I, S, K
- S in 4? No, T must be in 4. So this is invalid.

Another: CHINS
- C, H, I, N, S
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T is not present, but we know T must be in 4, so this is invalid.

Best seems CRUST or BRUST. CRUST is more common.

But CRUST has T in 4? No, T is 5th. So invalid.

Wait, need T in 4. So:
- _ _ _ T _
And must include S in 2-5.

Possible structure:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (O is new, S in 5, T in 4, no A/L/E)
- SHOTS (S in 1, no good)
- WHIST (S in 4, but T must be 4, so no)
- CHINS (no T in 4)

Actually, let's try:
- CHOTS
- C, H, O, T, S
- T is 4th (good)
- S is 5th (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- O and H are new letters to test

This seems good.

Another: SHOTS (but S in 1st conflicts with S needing to be 2-5)
Another: STORK (S in 1, no good)

Best seems CHOTS.

But CHOTS might not be valid. Let's check:
- CHOTS: valid word (variant of ""chock"" or slang)

Alternatively: CHINS (no T in 4)

Wait, need T in 4. Let's try:
- FIRST (but T is 5th)
- CHANT (no S)
- BRISK (no T in 4)
- CRUST (T is 5th)

Actually, let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (T in 4, S in 5, no A/L/E)

CHOTS seems best available.

But let's think differently: need T in 4, S in 2-5, avoid A/L/E.

Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STUMP"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STINT"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STOCK"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STORY"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)

So S must be in 2-5, but T is 4. So possible positions:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- ""BUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2, but Y is uncommon
- ""CUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but O is new
- ""DUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2
- ""FUSTY"" - not valid
- ""GUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but G and O are new

""GUSTO"" seems valid.

But let's check:
- GUSTO: G, U, S, T, O
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 2 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: G, U, O

This seems good.

Another: ""CUSTO"" - but CUSTO is not a common word.

""BUSTY"" is more common.

""BUSTY"":
- B, U, S, T, Y
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 3 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: B, U, Y

This seems better.

So final choice: BUSTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- T: correct in position 4
- E: not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word has a T in the 4th position.
- It has an S somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include S in one of positions 2-5.
3. Avoid L, A, E.
4. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- STORM (but T is already fixed at 4, so this would place S in 1 which conflicts with S needing to be in 2-5)
- SHIRT (S in 1 again, no good)
- SPORT (S in 1 again)
- FIRST (S in 1 again)
- CHANT (no S)
- CRUST (S in 5, T in 4, but U and R are new)
- BRUST (same issue with B)
- DRUST (same)

Better option: CRUST
- C, R, U are new letters.
- S in 5 (allowed, since 2-5)
- T in 4 (matches)

Another good one: BRISK
- B, R, I, S, K
- S in 4? No, T must be in 4. So this is invalid.

Another: CHINS
- C, H, I, N, S
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T is not present, but we know T must be in 4, so this is invalid.

Best seems CRUST or BRUST. CRUST is more common.

But CRUST has T in 4? No, T is 5th. So invalid.

Wait, need T in 4. So:
- _ _ _ T _
And must include S in 2-5.

Possible structure:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (O is new, S in 5, T in 4, no A/L/E)
- SHOTS (S in 1, no good)
- WHIST (S in 4, but T must be 4, so no)
- CHINS (no T in 4)

Actually, let's try:
- CHOTS
- C, H, O, T, S
- T is 4th (good)
- S is 5th (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- O and H are new letters to test

This seems good.

Another: SHOTS (but S in 1st conflicts with S needing to be 2-5)
Another: STORK (S in 1, no good)

Best seems CHOTS.

But CHOTS might not be valid. Let's check:
- CHOTS: valid word (variant of ""chock"" or slang)

Alternatively: CHINS (no T in 4)

Wait, need T in 4. Let's try:
- FIRST (but T is 5th)
- CHANT (no S)
- BRISK (no T in 4)
- CRUST (T is 5th)

Actually, let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (T in 4, S in 5, no A/L/E)

CHOTS seems best available.

But let's think differently: need T in 4, S in 2-5, avoid A/L/E.

Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STUMP"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STINT"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STOCK"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STORY"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)

So S must be in 2-5, but T is 4. So possible positions:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- ""BUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2, but Y is uncommon
- ""CUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but O is new
- ""DUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2
- ""FUSTY"" - not valid
- ""GUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but G and O are new

""GUSTO"" seems valid.

But let's check:
- GUSTO: G, U, S, T, O
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 2 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: G, U, O

This seems good.

Another: ""CUSTO"" - but CUSTO is not a common word.

""BUSTY"" is more common.

""BUSTY"":
- B, U, S, T, Y
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 3 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: B, U, Y

This seems better.

So final choice: BUSTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- T: correct in position 4
- E: not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word has a T in the 4th position.
- It has an S somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include S in one of positions 2-5.
3. Avoid L, A, E.
4. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- STORM (but T is already fixed at 4, so this would place S in 1 which conflicts with S needing to be in 2-5)
- SHIRT (S in 1 again, no good)
- SPORT (S in 1 again)
- FIRST (S in 1 again)
- CHANT (no S)
- CRUST (S in 5, T in 4, but U and R are new)
- BRUST (same issue with B)
- DRUST (same)

Better option: CRUST
- C, R, U are new letters.
- S in 5 (allowed, since 2-5)
- T in 4 (matches)

Another good one: BRISK
- B, R, I, S, K
- S in 4? No, T must be in 4. So this is invalid.

Another: CHINS
- C, H, I, N, S
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T is not present, but we know T must be in 4, so this is invalid.

Best seems CRUST or BRUST. CRUST is more common.

But CRUST has T in 4? No, T is 5th. So invalid.

Wait, need T in 4. So:
- _ _ _ T _
And must include S in 2-5.

Possible structure:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (O is new, S in 5, T in 4, no A/L/E)
- SHOTS (S in 1, no good)
- WHIST (S in 4, but T must be 4, so no)
- CHINS (no T in 4)

Actually, let's try:
- CHOTS
- C, H, O, T, S
- T is 4th (good)
- S is 5th (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- O and H are new letters to test

This seems good.

Another: SHOTS (but S in 1st conflicts with S needing to be 2-5)
Another: STORK (S in 1, no good)

Best seems CHOTS.

But CHOTS might not be valid. Let's check:
- CHOTS: valid word (variant of ""chock"" or slang)

Alternatively: CHINS (no T in 4)

Wait, need T in 4. Let's try:
- FIRST (but T is 5th)
- CHANT (no S)
- BRISK (no T in 4)
- CRUST (T is 5th)

Actually, let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (T in 4, S in 5, no A/L/E)

CHOTS seems best available.

But let's think differently: need T in 4, S in 2-5, avoid A/L/E.

Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STUMP"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STINT"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STOCK"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STORY"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)

So S must be in 2-5, but T is 4. So possible positions:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- ""BUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2, but Y is uncommon
- ""CUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but O is new
- ""DUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2
- ""FUSTY"" - not valid
- ""GUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but G and O are new

""GUSTO"" seems valid.

But let's check:
- GUSTO: G, U, S, T, O
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 2 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: G, U, O

This seems good.

Another: ""CUSTO"" - but CUSTO is not a common word.

""BUSTY"" is more common.

""BUSTY"":
- B, U, S, T, Y
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 3 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: B, U, Y

This seems better.

So final choice: BUSTY.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is locked in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, E are not in the word.

2. BUSTY → B(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)
   - U is in the word and in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is still in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - B and Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Positions: _ U _ T _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, U, T
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: B, L, A, E, Y
- S must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 is T), so S must be in 1 or 5.
- We have _ U _ T _ with S in 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S U _ T _
- _ U _ T S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
- S U _ T _: ""SUCKT"" (invalid), ""SUGAR"" (A excluded), ""SUSHY"" (Y excluded), ""SULTS"" (rare), ""SULTA"" (A excluded)
- _ U _ T S: ""CUTIS"" (rare), ""DUSTS"" (S already considered), ""FURTS"" (rare), ""GURTS"" (rare), ""HUMPS"" (no U), ""JUMPS"" (no U), ""KURTS"" (rare), ""LUMPS"" (L excluded), ""MURDS"" (D allowed), ""MURKS"" (K allowed), ""NURDS"" (D allowed), ""NURKS"" (K allowed), ""PURKS"" (K allowed), ""RUTTS"" (rare), ""SUTIS"" (invalid), ""TURKS"" (K allowed), ""VURTS"" (rare), ""WURTS"" (rare), ""XURTS"" (rare), ""ZURTS"" (rare)

Common words fitting _ U _ T S:
- ""MURDS"" (past tense of murder)
- ""NURDS"" (rare)
- ""TURKS"" (rare, but valid)

""MURDS"" seems the most common.

Check letters:
- M, U, R, D, S
- U is in position 2 (matches)
- T is in position 4 (matches)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- M, R, D are new letters to test

The feedback on Guess 4 says “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That’s a bit ambiguous, but the only sensible reading is that the assistant (or the system) intended to give a five-letter word but accidentally provided something else.  
Therefore, the actual feedback we need to act on is the pattern we already deduced from the earlier guesses:

- Position 2: U (✓)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ U _ T S  

We still need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that have not yet been ruled out.  
Letters already excluded: B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D, N (because NUTS was rejected, but that was just an error—N is still allowed).  

We also need to avoid any letter that appeared in any previous guess and was marked “x”.  
So far, the excluded letters are: B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D.

Common remaining consonants for position 1: C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W.  
Common remaining vowels for position 3: I, O (since U is already used).

Let’s list plausible words:

- C U I T S → “CUTIS” (valid, though rare)  
- C U O T S → “COUTS” (valid)  
- F U I T S → “FUTIS” (rare)  
- H U I T S → “HUTIS” (rare)  
- P U I T S → “PUDIS” (not a word)  
- V U I T S → “VUTIS” (rare)  

The clearest valid word is “CUTIS” (a medical term for the outer layer of skin), but it’s uncommon.  
A more common word is “COUTS” (third-person singular of “count” in some contexts).

Between these, “COUTS” is the better choice.

Check letters:
- C, O, U, T, S  
- U is in position 2 (✓)  
- T is in position 4 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  
- C and O have not been ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess is “COUTS”.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: not in the word at all
- T: correct in position 4
- E: not in the word at all

So we know:
- The word has a T in the 4th position.
- It has an S somewhere in positions 2-5.
- It does NOT contain L, A, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep T in position 4.
2. Include S in one of positions 2-5.
3. Avoid L, A, E.
4. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good candidates:
- STORM (but T is already fixed at 4, so this would place S in 1 which conflicts with S needing to be in 2-5)
- SHIRT (S in 1 again, no good)
- SPORT (S in 1 again)
- FIRST (S in 1 again)
- CHANT (no S)
- CRUST (S in 5, T in 4, but U and R are new)
- BRUST (same issue with B)
- DRUST (same)

Better option: CRUST
- C, R, U are new letters.
- S in 5 (allowed, since 2-5)
- T in 4 (matches)

Another good one: BRISK
- B, R, I, S, K
- S in 4? No, T must be in 4. So this is invalid.

Another: CHINS
- C, H, I, N, S
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T is not present, but we know T must be in 4, so this is invalid.

Best seems CRUST or BRUST. CRUST is more common.

But CRUST has T in 4? No, T is 5th. So invalid.

Wait, need T in 4. So:
- _ _ _ T _
And must include S in 2-5.

Possible structure:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (O is new, S in 5, T in 4, no A/L/E)
- SHOTS (S in 1, no good)
- WHIST (S in 4, but T must be 4, so no)
- CHINS (no T in 4)

Actually, let's try:
- CHOTS
- C, H, O, T, S
- T is 4th (good)
- S is 5th (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- O and H are new letters to test

This seems good.

Another: SHOTS (but S in 1st conflicts with S needing to be 2-5)
Another: STORK (S in 1, no good)

Best seems CHOTS.

But CHOTS might not be valid. Let's check:
- CHOTS: valid word (variant of ""chock"" or slang)

Alternatively: CHINS (no T in 4)

Wait, need T in 4. Let's try:
- FIRST (but T is 5th)
- CHANT (no S)
- BRISK (no T in 4)
- CRUST (T is 5th)

Actually, let's try:
- CHATS (T in 4, S in 5, but A is excluded)
- CHOTS (T in 4, S in 5, no A/L/E)

CHOTS seems best available.

But let's think differently: need T in 4, S in 2-5, avoid A/L/E.

Possible word: ""STOUT"" - but T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STUMP"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STINT"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STOCK"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)
""STORY"" - T is 4, S is 1 (invalid)

So S must be in 2-5, but T is 4. So possible positions:
- _ S _ T _
- _ _ S T _
- _ _ _ T S

Let's try:
- ""BUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2, but Y is uncommon
- ""CUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but O is new
- ""DUSTY"" - T is 4, S is 2
- ""FUSTY"" - not valid
- ""GUSTO"" - T is 4, S is 2, but G and O are new

""GUSTO"" seems valid.

But let's check:
- GUSTO: G, U, S, T, O
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 2 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: G, U, O

This seems good.

Another: ""CUSTO"" - but CUSTO is not a common word.

""BUSTY"" is more common.

""BUSTY"":
- B, U, S, T, Y
- T is 4 (good)
- S is 3 (allowed)
- No A, L, E
- New letters: B, U, Y

This seems better.

So final choice: BUSTY.

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - T is locked in position 4.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, A, E are not in the word.

   - U is in the word and in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - T is still in position 4 (confirmed again).
   - B and Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Positions: _ U _ T _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, U, T
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: B, L, A, E, Y
- S must be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 is T), so S must be in 1 or 5.
- We have _ U _ T _ with S in 1 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S U _ T _
- _ U _ T S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
- S U _ T _: ""SUCKT"" (invalid), ""SUGAR"" (A excluded), ""SUSHY"" (Y excluded), ""SULTS"" (rare), ""SULTA"" (A excluded)
- _ U _ T S: ""CUTIS"" (rare), ""DUSTS"" (S already considered), ""FURTS"" (rare), ""GURTS"" (rare), ""HUMPS"" (no U), ""JUMPS"" (no U), ""KURTS"" (rare), ""LUMPS"" (L excluded), ""MURDS"" (D allowed), ""MURKS"" (K allowed), ""NURDS"" (D allowed), ""NURKS"" (K allowed), ""PURKS"" (K allowed), ""RUTTS"" (rare), ""SUTIS"" (invalid), ""TURKS"" (K allowed), ""VURTS"" (rare), ""WURTS"" (rare), ""XURTS"" (rare), ""ZURTS"" (rare)

Common words fitting _ U _ T S:
- ""MURDS"" (past tense of murder)
- ""NURDS"" (rare)
- ""TURKS"" (rare, but valid)

""MURDS"" seems the most common.

Check letters:

- U is in position 2 (matches)
- T is in position 4 (matches)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and others, but let’s focus on common ones).

Looking for common 5-letter words matching _ U _ T S:

- C, F, G, H, I, K, N, P, V, W are the most likely.

Common words:
- CUTIS (rare, but valid)
- FUTS (too short)
- GUTS (too short)
- HUTS (too short)
- JUTS (too short)
- KUTS (too short)
- NUTS (valid)
- POUTS (but P is position 1, O is position 3, but O wasn’t ruled out)
- VUTS (rare)
- WUTS (rare)

The most common valid word is ""NUTS"".

Check letters:
- N, U, T, S
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- N is new and allowed
- No excluded letters (B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D) are used.

The feedback on Guess 4 says “Model answer is not five letters.”  
That’s a bit ambiguous, but the only sensible reading is that the assistant (or the system) intended to give a five-letter word but accidentally provided something else.  
Therefore, the actual feedback we need to act on is the pattern we already deduced from the earlier guesses:

- Position 2: U (✓)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ U _ T S

Letters already excluded: B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D, N (because NUTS was rejected, but that was just an error—N is still allowed).  

We also need to avoid any letter that appeared in any previous guess and was marked “x”.  
So far, the excluded letters are: B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D.

Common remaining consonants for position 1: C, F, G, H, K, P, V, W.  
Common remaining vowels for position 3: I, O (since U is already used).

A more common word is “COUTS” (third-person singular of “count” in some contexts).

Between these, “COUTS” is the better choice.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)

   - S is in the word but not at position 1.  
   - L, A, E are absent.

2. BUSTY → B(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) Y(x)  
   - U is fixed at position 2.  
   - S is in the word but not at position 3.  
   - T is confirmed at position 4.  
   - B, Y are absent.

3. MURDS → M(x) U(✓) R(x) D(x) S(✓)  
   - U is confirmed at position 2.  
   - S is confirmed at position 5.  
   - T is confirmed at position 4.  
   - M, R, D are absent.

4. NUTS → rejected (not five letters).  
   (We ignore this literally; the pattern remains _ U _ T S.)

5. COUTS → C(x) O(x) U(-) T(✓) S(✓)  
   - U is in the word but not at position 2.  
   - T is confirmed at position 4.  
   - S is confirmed at position 5.  
   - C, O are absent.

Now we know the exact pattern:

- Position 2: NOT U (from COUTS feedback)  
- Position 4: T (✓)  
- Position 5: S (✓)  

But U is still in the word somewhere else.  
Therefore, the only possible positions for U are 1 or 3, but position 2 is not U.

So the pattern must be either:

- U _ _ T S  (U in position 1)  
- _ _ U T S  (U in position 3)  

Letters still allowed: any except B, L, A, E, Y, M, R, D, C, O.

1. U _ _ T S  
   Possible: U, ?, ?, T, S  
   - ""USAGE"" – but A is excluded.  
   - ""UFTTS"" – not a word.  
   - ""UGISTS"" – too long.  
   No common 5-letter words here.

2. _ _ U T S  
   Possible: ?, ?, U, T, S  
   Common words:  
   - ""FUTS"" – too short.  
   - ""GUTS"" – valid word.  
   - ""HUTS"" – valid.  
   - ""JUTS"" – rare.  
   - ""KUTS"" – rare.  
   - ""NUTS"" – rejected earlier, but N is still allowed.  
   - ""PUDS"" – not a word.  
   - ""VUTS"" – rare.  

The most common valid word is ""GUTS"".

Check letters:  
G, U, T, S  
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since U must be somewhere else).  
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  
- G is new and allowed.  

Thus, ""GUTS"" is the logical next guess.
