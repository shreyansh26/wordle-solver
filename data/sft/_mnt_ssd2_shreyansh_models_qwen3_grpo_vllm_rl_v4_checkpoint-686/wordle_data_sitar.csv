### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. RASPY → R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, R, S.
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- R is not in positions 1 or 2.
- S is not in positions 3 or 4.

Positions ruled out:
- A: 1, 2
- R: 1, 2
- S: 3, 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no O, E, P, Y).

Let’s list possible positions for A, R, S:
A: 3,4,5
R: 3,4,5
S: 1,2,5

We also need two additional letters (not O,E,P,Y). Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If S is in position 1:
  - A and R must be in 3,4,5.
  - Possible: S _ A R _ or S _ R A _
  - Need two more letters. Let’s try S C A R F (but F hasn’t been tested yet).
  - But S is in position 1, A in 3, R in 4. This satisfies all constraints.

However, let’s check if SCARF uses any ruled-out letters: no O,E,P,Y. Looks good.

But wait, is SCARF a valid word? Yes.

But let me think of a better word that uses common letters.

Alternative: S T A R _ (but A must be in 3,4,5 and R in 3,4,5). STAR_ would have A in 4 and R in 5, which is allowed.

But we need two additional letters. STAR_ would need a 5th letter, but STAR is 4 letters. So STAR plus one more letter.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word. Let me think differently.

We have three letters A, R, S to place, plus two new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say T)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives S T A R N. 

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes, 1 is allowed.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STARN is not a valid word (no such word). Let me try another combination.

How about:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: new letter (say D)
- Position 5: R

This gives S L A D R – not a valid word.

Alternative approach: use A in position 4 or 5, R in position 3,4,5, S in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say C)
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say D)

This gives S C R A D – not a valid word.

Another option:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives T S R A N – not a valid word.

Let me try:
- Position 1: new letter (say C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say T)

This gives C S A R T – not a valid word.

Alternative: use S in position 5:
- Position 5: S
- Then A and R must be in positions 3,4 (since 5 is taken by S).
- Possible: _ _ A R S or _ A R _ S or A _ R _ S etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives T L A R S – not a valid word.

Another combination:
- Position 1: new letter (say D)
- Position 2: new letter (say I)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives D I A R S – not a valid word.

Let me try a different set of new letters. Maybe use common letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This gives S T A R N – which is a valid word (STARN is not, but STARN is not a word, but STAND is, but uses D).

Wait, let me think of a valid word that fits:
- S must be in 1,2,5
- A must be in 3,4,5
- R must be in 3,4,5

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This is S T A R N – but STARN is not a word. The valid word is STAND, but it uses D and N.

But STAND uses A in 3, R in 4, S in 1, and new letters T, N. This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STAND is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess should be STAND.

Let me try a different set of new letters. Maybe use common letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This gives S T A R N – which is a valid word (STARN is not, but STARN is not a word, but STAND is, but uses D).

Wait, let me think of a valid word that fits:
- S must be in 1,2,5
- A must be in 3,4,5
- R must be in 3,4,5

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This is S T A R N – but STARN is not a word. The valid word is STAND, but it uses D and N.

But STAND uses A in 3, R in 4, S in 1, and new letters T, N. This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STAND is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess should be STAND.",Guess 3: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S (each in some position other than where they were in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain O or E.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be (position 4).

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, S plus two other letters (not O or E). Let’s try to place A, R, S in new positions and pick common consonants for the remaining spots.

A good candidate is “RASPY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was not allowed in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not allowed in position 1).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since S was not allowed in position 4).
- P and Y are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. RASPY → R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, R, S.
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- R is not in positions 1 or 2.
- S is not in positions 3 or 4.

Positions ruled out:
- A: 1, 2
- R: 1, 2
- S: 3, 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no O, E, P, Y).

Let’s list possible positions for A, R, S:
A: 3,4,5
R: 3,4,5
S: 1,2,5

We also need two additional letters (not O,E,P,Y). Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If S is in position 1:
  - A and R must be in 3,4,5.
  - Possible: S _ A R _ or S _ R A _
  - Need two more letters. Let’s try S C A R F (but F hasn’t been tested yet).
  - But S is in position 1, A in 3, R in 4. This satisfies all constraints.

However, let’s check if SCARF uses any ruled-out letters: no O,E,P,Y. Looks good.

But wait, is SCARF a valid word? Yes.

But let me think of a better word that uses common letters.

Alternative: S T A R _ (but A must be in 3,4,5 and R in 3,4,5). STAR_ would have A in 4 and R in 5, which is allowed.

But we need two additional letters. STAR_ would need a 5th letter, but STAR is 4 letters. So STAR plus one more letter.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word. Let me think differently.

We have three letters A, R, S to place, plus two new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say T)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives S T A R N. 

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes, 1 is allowed.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STARN is not a valid word (no such word). Let me try another combination.

How about:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: new letter (say D)
- Position 5: R

This gives S L A D R – not a valid word.

Alternative approach: use A in position 4 or 5, R in position 3,4,5, S in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say C)
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say D)

This gives S C R A D – not a valid word.

Another option:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives T S R A N – not a valid word.

Let me try:
- Position 1: new letter (say C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say T)

This gives C S A R T – not a valid word.

Alternative: use S in position 5:
- Position 5: S
- Then A and R must be in positions 3,4 (since 5 is taken by S).
- Possible: _ _ A R S or _ A R _ S or A _ R _ S etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives T L A R S – not a valid word.

Another combination:
- Position 1: new letter (say D)
- Position 2: new letter (say I)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives D I A R S – not a valid word.

Let me try a different set of new letters. Maybe use common letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This gives S T A R N – which is a valid word (STARN is not, but STARN is not a word, but STAND is, but uses D).

Wait, let me think of a valid word that fits:
- S must be in 1,2,5
- A must be in 3,4,5
- R must be in 3,4,5

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This is S T A R N – but STARN is not a word. The valid word is STAND, but it uses D and N.

But STAND uses A in 3, R in 4, S in 1, and new letters T, N. This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STAND is a valid word.

From the new feedback on STAND:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) → T is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains T (not in position 2) and A (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Letters we know are in the word: S (position 1), T, A.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- T cannot be in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A and T somewhere (A not in 3, T not in 2).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O,E,P,Y,N,D).

Remaining possible letters (common): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place A and T:
- A can be in positions 2,4,5 (but not 3).
- T can be in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 2), but position 1 is already S.

Possible placements:
- If A is in 2: S A _ _ _
  - T must be in 3,4,5.
  - Need two more letters from remaining pool.
  - Example: S A T _ _ (but T would be in 3, which is allowed).
  - But we need to avoid using ruled-out letters.

Let’s try S A T _ _:
- Next letter: need to pick from remaining (B,C,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Z).
- Try S A T C H → ""SAT CH"" – but need a 5-letter word.
- ""SAT CH"" is not valid. Try ""SATYR"" – but Y is ruled out.
- ""SATIN"" – N is ruled out.
- ""SATIR"" – R is allowed, but ""SATIR"" is not a common word.
- ""SATYR"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""SATCK"" – not a word.

Alternative: A in 4:
- S _ _ A _
  - T must be in 2,3,5 (but not 2 is allowed for T? Wait T cannot be in 2).
  - So T must be in 3 or 5.
  - Example: S _ T A _ or S _ _ A T.
  - ""S C T A R"" – not a word.
  - ""S C A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A is in 3 (but A cannot be in 3).
  - ""S C A T S"" is invalid because A would be in 3.

Alternative: A in 5:
- S _ _ _ A
  - T must be in 3 or 4 (since T cannot be in 2).
  - Example: S _ T _ A or S _ _ T A.
  - ""S C T R A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R A T"" – but A is in 4, T in 5, which is allowed.

""SCRAT"" is a valid word (though rare), but let me think of more common words.

Another approach: use R, which has not been tested yet.
- S _ R _ A (A in 5, T must be in 3 or 4).
- ""S C R A T"" – A is in 4, T in 5. This fits all constraints:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
  - T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
  - Letters: S, C, R, A, T – none are ruled out (C,R are new, allowed).

""SCRAT"" is valid, but let me check if there's a more common word.

Alternative: S _ A _ T (A in 3 is not allowed, so skip).
S _ _ A T – ""S C A R T"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
S _ T A _ – ""S C T A R"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A in 3 is not allowed.
""S W A T H"" – H is allowed, but A in 3 is not allowed.

Best valid word fitting constraints seems ""SCRAT"", but let me think of ""STARK"":
- S T A R K:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – but T cannot be in 2 (from feedback T(-) in STAND). So invalid.

""STARK"" is invalid because T would be in 2.

""STAIR"":
- S T A I R:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAFF"":
- S T A F F:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STASH"":
- S T A S H:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRAY"":
- S T R A Y:
  - Y is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" already invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARE"":
- S T A R E:
  - E is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STAIN"":
- N is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STALK"":
- S T A L K:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAMP"":
- P is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARL"":
- Not a word.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

It seems ""SCRAT"" is the closest valid word fitting all constraints, but let me check if there's another.

Alternative: S _ _ T A:
- ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C U T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C A T A"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W E T A"" – E is ruled out.

""S L A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S P A T S"" – P is ruled out.

""S C A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S C R A T"" – A in 4, T in 5. This seems to be the only valid word fitting constraints.

""SCRAT"" is valid (though uncommon), but let me check if ""STARK"" can be adjusted.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""STARK"" but T is in 3 instead of 2.
""STARK"" has T in 2, which is invalid.

""STRAK"" – not a word.

""STRAP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRAY"" – Y is ruled out.

""STRUM"" – M is allowed, but U is allowed.
- S T R U M:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRIP"" – P is ruled out.

""STROK"" – not a word.

""STROKE"" – too long.

""STROP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRUT"" – T in 4, which is allowed.
- S T R U T:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 4 (not 2, allowed).
  - R, U are new letters.
  - This is a valid word.

""STRUT"" fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓).
- T in 4 (not 2, allowed).
- A must be present but is not in 3, so where is A?
Wait, this is a problem: ""STRUT"" does not contain A, but we know A is in the word.

So ""STRUT"" is invalid because it lacks A.

Back to the drawing board.

We need:
- S _ _ _ _
- Contains A and T (A not in 3, T not in 2).
- No O,E,P,Y,N,D.

Possible word: ""S C A R T"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
""S C A T R"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
""S C R A T"" – A in 4, T in 5. This is valid.

""SCRAT"" is valid, though rare.

Another: ""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.
""S C U T A"" – not a word.
""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T H"" – not a word.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

It seems ""SCRAT"" is the only valid word fitting constraints, but let me check if there's another.

Alternative: ""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A R T"" – invalid.

""S C A R T"" – invalid.

Another approach: use I instead of R.
""S C A I T"" – not a word.
""S C A T I"" – not a word.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

It seems the only valid word is ""SCRAT"", but let me think of ""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

Wait, let me list possible words systematically:

Start with S, must contain A and T, A not in 3, T not in 2, no O,E,P,Y,N,D.

Possible patterns:

6. S _ _ _ A (A in 5)

   - No valid words here.

From this exhaustive check, the only valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is ""SCRAT"".

However, ""SCRAT"" is quite uncommon. Let me double-check if I missed any words.

Another possible word: ""S C A R T"" – but A is in 3, which is not allowed.

""S C A T S"" – A in 3, not allowed.

""S C U T A"" – not a word.

""S C R A T"" – valid word, but A is in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""SCRAT"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me think of ""S C A R T"" again – A in 4, T in 5, S in 1.

This is actually valid: S C A R T – but this is ""SCART"", which is a valid word (a type of cable connector).

But ""SCART"" has A in 4, T in 5, S in 1, and uses C and R, which haven't been ruled out.

This seems better than ""SCRAT"".

Let me check ""SCART"":
- S in 1 (✓).
- A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
- T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
- Letters: S,C,A,R,T – none are ruled out.
- Valid word.

This is a better choice.

Thus, the next guess should be SCART.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- S is correctly placed in position 1.
- A and T are in the word but not yet in the right spots.
- N and D are not in the word.
- O, E, P, Y are also ruled out.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is ""SCART"".

<guess>SCART</guess>",SCART,"From the new feedback on STAND:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) → T is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains T (not in position 2) and A (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Letters we know are in the word: S (position 1), T, A.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- T cannot be in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A and T somewhere (A not in 3, T not in 2).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O,E,P,Y,N,D).

Remaining possible letters (common): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place A and T:
- A can be in positions 2,4,5 (but not 3).
- T can be in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 2), but position 1 is already S.

Possible placements:
- If A is in 2: S A _ _ _
  - T must be in 3,4,5.
  - Need two more letters from remaining pool.
  - Example: S A T _ _ (but T would be in 3, which is allowed).
  - But we need to avoid using ruled-out letters.

Let’s try S A T _ _:
- Next letter: need to pick from remaining (B,C,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Z).
- Try S A T C H → ""SAT CH"" – but need a 5-letter word.
- ""SAT CH"" is not valid. Try ""SATYR"" – but Y is ruled out.
- ""SATIN"" – N is ruled out.
- ""SATIR"" – R is allowed, but ""SATIR"" is not a common word.
- ""SATYR"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""SATCK"" – not a word.

Alternative: A in 4:
- S _ _ A _
  - T must be in 2,3,5 (but not 2 is allowed for T? Wait T cannot be in 2).
  - So T must be in 3 or 5.
  - Example: S _ T A _ or S _ _ A T.
  - ""S C T A R"" – not a word.
  - ""S C A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A is in 3 (but A cannot be in 3).
  - ""S C A T S"" is invalid because A would be in 3.

Alternative: A in 5:
- S _ _ _ A
  - T must be in 3 or 4 (since T cannot be in 2).
  - Example: S _ T _ A or S _ _ T A.
  - ""S C T R A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R A T"" – but A is in 4, T in 5, which is allowed.

""SCRAT"" is a valid word (though rare), but let me think of more common words.

Another approach: use R, which has not been tested yet.
- S _ R _ A (A in 5, T must be in 3 or 4).
- ""S C R A T"" – A is in 4, T in 5. This fits all constraints:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
  - T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
  - Letters: S, C, R, A, T – none are ruled out (C,R are new, allowed).

""SCRAT"" is valid, but let me check if there's a more common word.

Alternative: S _ A _ T (A in 3 is not allowed, so skip).
S _ _ A T – ""S C A R T"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
S _ T A _ – ""S C T A R"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A in 3 is not allowed.
""S W A T H"" – H is allowed, but A in 3 is not allowed.

Best valid word fitting constraints seems ""SCRAT"", but let me think of ""STARK"":
- S T A R K:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – but T cannot be in 2 (from feedback T(-) in STAND). So invalid.

""STARK"" is invalid because T would be in 2.

""STAIR"":
- S T A I R:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAFF"":
- S T A F F:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STASH"":
- S T A S H:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRAY"":
- S T R A Y:
  - Y is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" already invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARE"":
- S T A R E:
  - E is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STAIN"":
- N is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STALK"":
- S T A L K:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAMP"":
- P is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARL"":
- Not a word.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

It seems ""SCRAT"" is the closest valid word fitting all constraints, but let me check if there's another.

Alternative: S _ _ T A:
- ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C U T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C A T A"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W E T A"" – E is ruled out.

""S L A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S P A T S"" – P is ruled out.

""S C A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S C R A T"" – A in 4, T in 5. This seems to be the only valid word fitting constraints.

""SCRAT"" is valid (though uncommon), but let me check if ""STARK"" can be adjusted.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""STARK"" but T is in 3 instead of 2.
""STARK"" has T in 2, which is invalid.

""STRAK"" – not a word.

""STRAP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRAY"" – Y is ruled out.

""STRUM"" – M is allowed, but U is allowed.

  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRIP"" – P is ruled out.

""STROK"" – not a word.

""STROKE"" – too long.

""STROP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRUT"" – T in 4, which is allowed.
- S T R U T:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 4 (not 2, allowed).
  - R, U are new letters.
  - This is a valid word.

From this exhaustive check, the only valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is ""SCRAT"".

""S C A T S"" – A in 3, not allowed.

""S C U T A"" – not a word.

Yes, ""SCRAT"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me think of ""S C A R T"" again – A in 4, T in 5, S in 1.

This is actually valid: S C A R T – but this is ""SCART"", which is a valid word (a type of cable connector).

But ""SCART"" has A in 4, T in 5, S in 1, and uses C and R, which haven't been ruled out.

- A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
- T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
- Letters: S,C,A,R,T – none are ruled out.
- Valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S (each in some position other than where they were in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain O or E.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in position 1.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be (position 4).

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, S plus two other letters (not O or E). Let’s try to place A, R, S in new positions and pick common consonants for the remaining spots.

A good candidate is “RASPY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was not allowed in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was not allowed in position 1).
- S in position 3 (allowed, since S was not allowed in position 4).
- P and Y are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. RASPY → R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains A, R, S.
- A is not in positions 1 or 2.
- R is not in positions 1 or 2.
- S is not in positions 3 or 4.

Positions ruled out:
- A: 1, 2
- R: 1, 2
- S: 3, 4

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, S.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no O, E, P, Y).

Let’s list possible positions for A, R, S:
A: 3,4,5
R: 3,4,5
S: 1,2,5

We also need two additional letters (not O,E,P,Y). Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If S is in position 1:
  - A and R must be in 3,4,5.
  - Possible: S _ A R _ or S _ R A _
  - Need two more letters. Let’s try S C A R F (but F hasn’t been tested yet).
  - But S is in position 1, A in 3, R in 4. This satisfies all constraints.

However, let’s check if SCARF uses any ruled-out letters: no O,E,P,Y. Looks good.

But wait, is SCARF a valid word? Yes.

But let me think of a better word that uses common letters.

Alternative: S T A R _ (but A must be in 3,4,5 and R in 3,4,5). STAR_ would have A in 4 and R in 5, which is allowed.

But we need two additional letters. STAR_ would need a 5th letter, but STAR is 4 letters. So STAR plus one more letter.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word. Let me think differently.

We have three letters A, R, S to place, plus two new letters.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say T)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives S T A R N. 

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes, 1 is allowed.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STARN is not a valid word (no such word). Let me try another combination.

How about:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: new letter (say D)
- Position 5: R

This gives S L A D R – not a valid word.

Alternative approach: use A in position 4 or 5, R in position 3,4,5, S in position 1 or 2.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: new letter (say C)
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say D)

This gives S C R A D – not a valid word.

Another option:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: new letter (say N)

This gives T S R A N – not a valid word.

Let me try:
- Position 1: new letter (say C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: new letter (say T)

This gives C S A R T – not a valid word.

Alternative: use S in position 5:
- Position 5: S
- Then A and R must be in positions 3,4 (since 5 is taken by S).
- Possible: _ _ A R S or _ A R _ S or A _ R _ S etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: new letter (say T)
- Position 2: new letter (say L)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives T L A R S – not a valid word.

Another combination:
- Position 1: new letter (say D)
- Position 2: new letter (say I)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: S

This gives D I A R S – not a valid word.

Let me try a different set of new letters. Maybe use common letters like B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This gives S T A R N – which is a valid word (STARN is not, but STARN is not a word, but STAND is, but uses D).

Wait, let me think of a valid word that fits:
- S must be in 1,2,5
- A must be in 3,4,5
- R must be in 3,4,5

Let’s try:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: N

This is S T A R N – but STARN is not a word. The valid word is STAND, but it uses D and N.

But STAND uses A in 3, R in 4, S in 1, and new letters T, N. This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S is in position 1 (allowed: 1,2,5) – yes.
- A is in position 3 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- R is in position 4 (allowed: 3,4,5) – yes.
- T and N are new letters not ruled out.

STAND is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess should be STAND.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: RASPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STAND:
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) → T is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains T (not in position 2) and A (not in position 3).
- It does NOT contain O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Letters we know are in the word: S (position 1), T, A.
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y, N, D.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- T cannot be in position 2.
- S is fixed in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A and T somewhere (A not in 3, T not in 2).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O,E,P,Y,N,D).

Remaining possible letters (common): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place A and T:
- A can be in positions 2,4,5 (but not 3).
- T can be in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not 2), but position 1 is already S.

Possible placements:
- If A is in 2: S A _ _ _
  - T must be in 3,4,5.
  - Need two more letters from remaining pool.
  - Example: S A T _ _ (but T would be in 3, which is allowed).
  - But we need to avoid using ruled-out letters.

Let’s try S A T _ _:
- Next letter: need to pick from remaining (B,C,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Z).
- Try S A T C H → ""SAT CH"" – but need a 5-letter word.
- ""SAT CH"" is not valid. Try ""SATYR"" – but Y is ruled out.
- ""SATIN"" – N is ruled out.
- ""SATIR"" – R is allowed, but ""SATIR"" is not a common word.
- ""SATYR"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""SATCK"" – not a word.

Alternative: A in 4:
- S _ _ A _
  - T must be in 2,3,5 (but not 2 is allowed for T? Wait T cannot be in 2).
  - So T must be in 3 or 5.
  - Example: S _ T A _ or S _ _ A T.
  - ""S C T A R"" – not a word.
  - ""S C A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A is in 3 (but A cannot be in 3).
  - ""S C A T S"" is invalid because A would be in 3.

Alternative: A in 5:
- S _ _ _ A
  - T must be in 3 or 4 (since T cannot be in 2).
  - Example: S _ T _ A or S _ _ T A.
  - ""S C T R A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
  - ""S C R A T"" – but A is in 4, T in 5, which is allowed.

""SCRAT"" is a valid word (though rare), but let me think of more common words.

Another approach: use R, which has not been tested yet.
- S _ R _ A (A in 5, T must be in 3 or 4).
- ""S C R A T"" – A is in 4, T in 5. This fits all constraints:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
  - T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
  - Letters: S, C, R, A, T – none are ruled out (C,R are new, allowed).

""SCRAT"" is valid, but let me check if there's a more common word.

Alternative: S _ A _ T (A in 3 is not allowed, so skip).
S _ _ A T – ""S C A R T"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
S _ T A _ – ""S C T A R"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W A T S"" – but S is already in 1, and A in 3 is not allowed.
""S W A T H"" – H is allowed, but A in 3 is not allowed.

Best valid word fitting constraints seems ""SCRAT"", but let me think of ""STARK"":
- S T A R K:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – but T cannot be in 2 (from feedback T(-) in STAND). So invalid.

""STARK"" is invalid because T would be in 2.

""STAIR"":
- S T A I R:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAFF"":
- S T A F F:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STASH"":
- S T A S H:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRAY"":
- S T R A Y:
  - Y is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" already invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARE"":
- S T A R E:
  - E is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STAIN"":
- N is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STALK"":
- S T A L K:
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STAMP"":
- P is ruled out.
  - Invalid.

""STARL"":
- Not a word.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

""STARK"" invalid.

It seems ""SCRAT"" is the closest valid word fitting all constraints, but let me check if there's another.

Alternative: S _ _ T A:
- ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C U T A"" – not a word.
- ""S C A T A"" – not a word.

Another valid word: ""S W E T A"" – E is ruled out.

""S L A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S P A T S"" – P is ruled out.

""S C A T S"" – A in 3 is not allowed.

""S C R A T"" – A in 4, T in 5. This seems to be the only valid word fitting constraints.

""SCRAT"" is valid (though uncommon), but let me check if ""STARK"" can be adjusted.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""STARK"" but T is in 3 instead of 2.
""STARK"" has T in 2, which is invalid.

""STRAK"" – not a word.

""STRAP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRAY"" – Y is ruled out.

""STRUM"" – M is allowed, but U is allowed.
- S T R U M:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 2 – not allowed.
  - Invalid.

""STRIP"" – P is ruled out.

""STROK"" – not a word.

""STROKE"" – too long.

""STROP"" – P is ruled out.

""STRUT"" – T in 4, which is allowed.
- S T R U T:
  - S in 1 (✓).
  - T in 4 (not 2, allowed).
  - R, U are new letters.
  - This is a valid word.

""STRUT"" fits all constraints:
- S in 1 (✓).
- T in 4 (not 2, allowed).
- A must be present but is not in 3, so where is A?
Wait, this is a problem: ""STRUT"" does not contain A, but we know A is in the word.

So ""STRUT"" is invalid because it lacks A.

Back to the drawing board.

We need:
- S _ _ _ _
- Contains A and T (A not in 3, T not in 2).
- No O,E,P,Y,N,D.

Possible word: ""S C A R T"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
""S C A T R"" – A in 3 is not allowed.
""S C R A T"" – A in 4, T in 5. This is valid.

""SCRAT"" is valid, though rare.

Another: ""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.
""S C U T A"" – not a word.
""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T H"" – not a word.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

It seems ""SCRAT"" is the only valid word fitting constraints, but let me check if there's another.

Alternative: ""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A R T"" – invalid.

""S C A R T"" – invalid.

Another approach: use I instead of R.
""S C A I T"" – not a word.
""S C A T I"" – not a word.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T H"" – not a word.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

""S C A T T"" – not a word.

""S C A T S"" – invalid A in 3.

It seems the only valid word is ""SCRAT"", but let me think of ""S C A R T"" – invalid A in 3.

Wait, let me list possible words systematically:

Start with S, must contain A and T, A not in 3, T not in 2, no O,E,P,Y,N,D.

Possible patterns:
1. S A T _ _ (A in 2, T in 3)
   - Need two more letters from remaining: B,C,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Z.

   - ""SAT VR"" – not a word.
   - ""SAT WR"" – not a word.
   - ""SAT XR"" – not a word.
   - ""SAT ZR"" – not a word.
   - No valid words here.

2. S A _ T _ (A in 2, T in 4)
   - ""SA C T_"" – not a word.
   - ""SA I T_"" – not a word.
   - ""SA R T_"" – ""S A R T_"" – ""S A R T H"" – not a word.

   - ""S A R T M"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T Q"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T U"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T V"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T W"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T X"" – not a word.
   - ""S A R T Z"" – not a word.
   - No valid words here.

3. S A _ _ T (A in 2, T in 5)
   - ""SA C R T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C L T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C M T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C B T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C G T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C H T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C K T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C L T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C M T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C U T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C V T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C W T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C X T"" – not a word.
   - ""SA C Z T"" – not a word.
   - No valid words here.

4. S _ A T _ (A in 3 – not allowed, skip)
5. S _ _ A T (A in 4, T in 5)
   - ""S C R A T"" – valid word.
   - ""S C L A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C M A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C B A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C G A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C H A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C K A T"" – not a word.

   - ""S C U A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C V A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C W A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C X A T"" – not a word.
   - ""S C Z A T"" – not a word.
   - Only ""SCRAT"" is valid.

6. S _ _ _ A (A in 5)
   - ""S C R T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C L T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C M T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C B T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C G T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C H T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C K T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C L T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C M T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C U T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C V T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C W T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C X T A"" – not a word.
   - ""S C Z T A"" – not a word.
   - No valid words here.

From this exhaustive check, the only valid 5-letter word that fits all constraints is ""SCRAT"".

However, ""SCRAT"" is quite uncommon. Let me double-check if I missed any words.

Another possible word: ""S C A R T"" – but A is in 3, which is not allowed.

""S C A T S"" – A in 3, not allowed.

""S C U T A"" – not a word.

""S C R A T"" – valid word, but A is in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""SCRAT"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But wait, let me think of ""S C A R T"" again – A in 4, T in 5, S in 1.

This is actually valid: S C A R T – but this is ""SCART"", which is a valid word (a type of cable connector).

But ""SCART"" has A in 4, T in 5, S in 1, and uses C and R, which haven't been ruled out.

This seems better than ""SCRAT"".

Let me check ""SCART"":
- S in 1 (✓).
- A in 4 (not 3, allowed).
- T in 5 (not 2, allowed).
- Letters: S,C,A,R,T – none are ruled out.
- Valid word.

This is a better choice.

Thus, the next guess should be SCART.Based on the feedback so far:
- S is correctly placed in position 1.
- A and T are in the word but not yet in the right spots.
- N and D are not in the word.
- O, E, P, Y are also ruled out.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is ""SCART"".

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Summary of known facts:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), A, R, T
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y, N, D, C
- Position restrictions:
  – A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in 4 or 5
  – R: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 → must be in 3 or 5
  – T: cannot be in positions 2, 5 → must be in 3 or 4
  – S is fixed in position 1.

Let’s enumerate the only possible placements of A, R, T that satisfy all restrictions.

We have three letters (A, R, T) to place in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with the above restrictions.

Possible positions left: 2, 3, 4, 5  
But:
- Position 2: T can go here (allowed), A and R cannot go here (A cannot be in 2, R cannot be in 1 but 1 is already S, so R can be in 2? Wait no: R cannot be in 2 from STAND feedback (T(-) means T is in word but not in 2, but R(-) in SCART means R is in word but not in 4, not directly about 2). Actually from RASPY: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1, and from SCART: R(-) means not in 4. So R can be in 2,3,5 but:
   - From STAND: A(-) means A not in 3, but R is unrestricted in 2 except that from RASPY: R(-) means R not in 1, so R can be in 2,3,5.
   - From SCART: R(-) means not in 4, so R in 2,3,5.
   - From STAND: T(-) means T not in 2.
   - From SCART: T(-) means T not in 5.
   - So T must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s list possible permutations of A, R, T across positions 2,3,4,5 with:
- A: 4 or 5
- R: 2,3,5
- T: 3 or 4

Case 1: T in 3
   - Then positions:
     1: S
     3: T
     A must be in 4 or 5
     R must be in 2,5 (since 3 is T and 4 could be A)
   - Subcase 1a: A in 4
        - Then R must be in 2 or 5
        - But position 2: R allowed (not excluded)
        - So possible:
           S R T A ?
           But we have 5 letters, so position 5 must be filled by one of remaining letters (but we only have A,R,T,S). Wait we have S fixed, and letters in word are S,A,R,T. So the word must be S _ _ _ _ with A,R,T in the remaining 4 positions. So the letters are S,A,R,T plus one more letter? No, the word is exactly S plus permutation of A,R,T in positions 2,3,4,5. But we have 4 positions and 3 letters? Wait no: the word is 5 letters with S in 1, and the other 4 positions must contain A,R,T plus one more letter? No, the word must be exactly S followed by a permutation of A,R,T in positions 2,3,4,5, but that’s 4 letters, so one position remains. This suggests I missed that the word must have 5 letters with S fixed in 1, and the other 4 positions filled by A,R,T plus one more letter not yet used. But from feedback, we know the word contains S,A,R,T. So the 5th letter must be one of the remaining unused letters not ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But this seems complex. Let me re-express:

The word is 5 letters, starts with S, and must contain A, R, T. So the remaining 4 positions (2,3,4,5) must contain A, R, T plus one more letter (which must be from allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

But from feedback, we have only A,R,S in the word so far? Or is there more?

Actually, from feedback, we know:
- Letters in word: S (position 1), A, R, T
- Letters not in word: O, E, P, Y, N, D, C
- So the word must be S _ _ _ _ with A, R, T in positions 2,3,4,5 and one more letter (but we only have S,A,R,T). This implies the word is exactly S followed by a permutation of A,R,T, but that’s 4 letters, so this is impossible. This suggests I misread: the word must be 5 letters with S in 1, and the other 4 positions filled by A,R,T plus one more letter, but we have no info on that 5th letter. However, from feedback, we only know A,R,T are in the word, but not necessarily all of them. Wait no: from feedback, A,R,T are all confirmed in the word.

This indicates the word is S followed by a permutation of A,R,T plus one more letter, but we have no constraints on that 5th letter. However, from feedback, we have only A,R,S confirmed, and no info on other letters. This seems ambiguous.

Re-examining feedback:
- STAND feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x) – means S is correct in 1, T is in word but not 2, A is in word but not 3, N and D not in word.
- SCART feedback: S(✓) C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) – means S correct in 1, C not in word, A in word but not 3, R in word but not 4, T in word but not 5.

Thus, the word contains S, A, R, T, and one more letter (since 5 letters total). But we have no info on that 5th letter, so we must assume it’s one of the remaining letters not ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

But since we have S fixed in 1, and A,R,T must be in positions 2,3,4,5 with their restrictions, let’s focus on placing A,R,T.

Given:
- A must be in 4 or 5
- R must be in 2,3,5 (cannot be 1,4 from feedback)
- T must be in 3 or 4

Let’s list possible permutations:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   S ? ? ? ?

We need to place A,R,T in 2,3,4,5 with:
- A: 4 or 5
- R: 2,3,5
- T: 3,4

Possible placements:

Option 1: T in 3
   - Then:
     - A must be in 4 or 5
     - R must be in 2 or 5
   - Suboption 1a: A in 4
        - Then R must be in 2 or 5
        - If R in 2:
            S R T A ?
            The last position (5) must be one of remaining letters (B,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z)
            But we have no constraints on it, so possible. The word would be S R T A ?
            But we need to check if this forms a valid word. ""SRTA?"" – no common words.
        - If R in 5:
            S _ T A R
            The blank (position 2) must be one of remaining letters. Possible word: S I T A R – ""SITAR"" (a musical instrument). This fits all constraints:
              - S in 1 (✓)
              - A in 4 (allowed)
              - R in 5 (allowed)
              - T in 3 (allowed)
              - I is a new letter not ruled out.
            - ""SITAR"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Option 2: T in 4
   - Then:
     - A must be in 5 (since 4 is T)
     - R must be in 2 or 3 (since 5 is A)
   - Suboption 2a: R in 2
        - S R _ T A
        - Middle position 3 must be one of remaining letters. Possible word: S R I T A – ""S R I T A"" not a word.
   - Suboption 2b: R in 3
        - S _ R T A
        - Position 2 must be one of remaining letters. Possible word: S I R T A – ""SIRTA"" not a word.
   - No valid words here.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is ""SITAR"".

<guess>SITAR</guess>",SITAR,"Let’s extract every constraint from all feedback so far.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - O and E are NOT in the word.

2. RASPY → R(-) A(-) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - P and Y are NOT in the word.

3. STAND → S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)
   - S is in position 1 (fixed).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - N and D are NOT in the word.

4. SCART → S(✓) C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-)
   - C is NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Summary of known facts:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Letters in the word: S (position 1), A, R, T
- Letters NOT in the word: O, E, P, Y, N, D, C
- Position restrictions:
  – A: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be in 4 or 5
  – R: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 → must be in 3 or 5
  – T: cannot be in positions 2, 5 → must be in 3 or 4
  – S is fixed in position 1.

Let’s enumerate the only possible placements of A, R, T that satisfy all restrictions.

We have three letters (A, R, T) to place in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 with the above restrictions.

Possible positions left: 2, 3, 4, 5  
But:
- Position 2: T can go here (allowed), A and R cannot go here (A cannot be in 2, R cannot be in 1 but 1 is already S, so R can be in 2? Wait no: R cannot be in 2 from STAND feedback (T(-) means T is in word but not in 2, but R(-) in SCART means R is in word but not in 4, not directly about 2). Actually from RASPY: R(-) means R is in word but not in position 1, and from SCART: R(-) means not in 4. So R can be in 2,3,5 but:
   - From STAND: A(-) means A not in 3, but R is unrestricted in 2 except that from RASPY: R(-) means R not in 1, so R can be in 2,3,5.
   - From SCART: R(-) means not in 4, so R in 2,3,5.
   - From STAND: T(-) means T not in 2.
   - From SCART: T(-) means T not in 5.
   - So T must be in 3 or 4.

Let’s list possible permutations of A, R, T across positions 2,3,4,5 with:
- A: 4 or 5
- R: 2,3,5
- T: 3 or 4

Case 1: T in 3
   - Then positions:
     1: S
     3: T
     A must be in 4 or 5
     R must be in 2,5 (since 3 is T and 4 could be A)
   - Subcase 1a: A in 4
        - Then R must be in 2 or 5
        - But position 2: R allowed (not excluded)
        - So possible:
           S R T A ?
           But we have 5 letters, so position 5 must be filled by one of remaining letters (but we only have A,R,T,S). Wait we have S fixed, and letters in word are S,A,R,T. So the word must be S _ _ _ _ with A,R,T in the remaining 4 positions. So the letters are S,A,R,T plus one more letter? No, the word is exactly S plus permutation of A,R,T in positions 2,3,4,5. But we have 4 positions and 3 letters? Wait no: the word is 5 letters with S in 1, and the other 4 positions must contain A,R,T plus one more letter? No, the word must be exactly S followed by a permutation of A,R,T in positions 2,3,4,5, but that’s 4 letters, so one position remains. This suggests I missed that the word must have 5 letters with S fixed in 1, and the other 4 positions filled by A,R,T plus one more letter not yet used. But from feedback, we know the word contains S,A,R,T. So the 5th letter must be one of the remaining unused letters not ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Re-examining feedback:
- STAND feedback: S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x) – means S is correct in 1, T is in word but not 2, A is in word but not 3, N and D not in word.
- SCART feedback: S(✓) C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) – means S correct in 1, C not in word, A in word but not 3, R in word but not 4, T in word but not 5.

Thus, the word contains S, A, R, T, and one more letter (since 5 letters total). But we have no info on that 5th letter, so we must assume it’s one of the remaining letters not ruled out: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
