For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A well-chosen first guess would cover several of these common letters without repeating any, to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

""DUKER"" is a good choice.Based on the feedback so far:
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

The word must contain E and R, with E in positions 1, 2, or 3 and R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new untested letters is ""DUKER"".",Guess 3: DUKER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(x) K(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A well-chosen first guess would cover several of these common letters without repeating any, to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A strong second guess would be “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are new letters.
- E is placed in position 4 instead of 5 to test its new location.

<guess>CRONE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
CRONE → C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N (x-feedback).
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - E (from both guesses, but in wrong positions)
   - R (from CRONE, wrong position)

So the secret word must contain both E and R, and neither E nor R can be in the positions we tried:
- E cannot be in position 5 (SLATE) or 4 (CRONE).
- R cannot be in position 2 (CRONE).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, I, G, B, H, F, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and R.
- Places E in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since 2 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, L, A, T, C, O, N).

A good candidate is ""DRIER"":
- Contains both E and R.
- E is in position 3 (new spot).
- R is in positions 2 and 4 (but position 2 is ruled out for R, so this would give feedback on position 4).
- Uses new letters D and I (not yet tested).

However, ""DRIER"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""FRESH"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 4 (but we know E can't be in 4 from CRONE), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""MERGE"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in positions 3 and 5 (position 5 is invalid), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""PERKY"":
- Contains E and R, but E is in position 2 (valid), R is in position 1 (valid).
- Uses new letters P and K, Y.
- This seems valid.

But let me check if ""PERKY"" has any eliminated letters: P, E, R, K, Y - none are eliminated. Good.

Another candidate: ""BERRY"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 3 (valid), R is in positions 2 and 4 (position 2 is invalid for R), so invalid.

""GUIDE"" lacks R, so invalid.

""URBEN"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""REBEL"" has E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 is invalid for E).

""FERRY"":
- E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 invalid), R in positions 1 and 3 (position 3 is valid for R).
- Invalid due to E in 4.

""DIRER"":
- E in 3 (valid), R in 2 and 4 (position 2 invalid for R), so invalid.

""MERGE"" already ruled out.

""PERKY"" seems the best so far:
- E in position 2 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).
- Uses P, K, Y (new letters).

Another check: ""FRESH"" invalid (E in 4), ""DRIER"" invalid (R in 2), ""BERRY"" invalid (R in 2), ""REBEL"" invalid (E in 4).

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A well-chosen first guess would cover several of these common letters without repeating any, to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A strong second guess would be “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are new letters.
- E is placed in position 4 instead of 5 to test its new location.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
CRONE → C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N (x-feedback).
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - E (from both guesses, but in wrong positions)
   - R (from CRONE, wrong position)

So the secret word must contain both E and R, and neither E nor R can be in the positions we tried:
- E cannot be in position 5 (SLATE) or 4 (CRONE).
- R cannot be in position 2 (CRONE).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, I, G, B, H, F, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and R.
- Places E in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since 2 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, L, A, T, C, O, N).

A good candidate is ""DRIER"":
- Contains both E and R.
- E is in position 3 (new spot).
- R is in positions 2 and 4 (but position 2 is ruled out for R, so this would give feedback on position 4).
- Uses new letters D and I (not yet tested).

However, ""DRIER"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""FRESH"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 4 (but we know E can't be in 4 from CRONE), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""MERGE"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in positions 3 and 5 (position 5 is invalid), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""PERKY"":
- Contains E and R, but E is in position 2 (valid), R is in position 1 (valid).
- Uses new letters P and K, Y.
- This seems valid.

But let me check if ""PERKY"" has any eliminated letters: P, E, R, K, Y - none are eliminated. Good.

Another candidate: ""BERRY"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 3 (valid), R is in positions 2 and 4 (position 2 is invalid for R), so invalid.

""GUIDE"" lacks R, so invalid.

""URBEN"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""REBEL"" has E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 is invalid for E).

""FERRY"":
- E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 invalid), R in positions 1 and 3 (position 3 is valid for R).
- Invalid due to E in 4.

""DIRER"":
- E in 3 (valid), R in 2 and 4 (position 2 invalid for R), so invalid.

""MERGE"" already ruled out.

""PERKY"" seems the best so far:
- E in position 2 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).
- Uses P, K, Y (new letters).

Another check: ""FRESH"" invalid (E in 4), ""DRIER"" invalid (R in 2), ""BERRY"" invalid (R in 2), ""REBEL"" invalid (E in 4).

""PERKY"" is valid.

But let me think of another: ""GRIPE"":
- E in position 5 (invalid), so no.

""CRIME"" has C and M (C is eliminated).

""PRISE"" has S (eliminated).

""BRIDE"":
- E in position 5 (invalid).

""PRONE"" has O and N (both eliminated).

""FRISK"" has S (eliminated).

""PRIED"":
- E in position 4 (invalid).

""PRIME"" invalid (E in 5).

""PERKY"" seems the only valid option with E in 2 and R in 1, using new letters P, K, Y.

But wait, let me think of ""URBEN"" - but E is in 5 (invalid).

""MERGE"" invalid.

""FERRY"" invalid.

""DRIER"" invalid.

""CRANE"" has C and N (eliminated).

""GRAPE"" has G, A (A eliminated), P, E, but A is out.

""GRAPE"" invalid.

""GRIME"" has C (no, C is eliminated).

""GRIME"" has G, R, I, M, E - all allowed except R position?

Wait, ""GRIME"":

- U, R, G, E, D.

""PERKY"" seems the only valid option.

But let me think of ""DUPER"":
- D, U, P, E, R.
- E in position 4 (invalid).

""DUKER"":
- E in position 3 (valid), R in position 5 (valid).
- Uses D, U, K, E, R - all allowed.
- This seems better than PERKY as it tests E in 3 and R in 5, and new letters D, U, K.

""DUKER"" is valid:
- E in 3 (valid), R in 5 (valid).
- No eliminated letters.

This seems a better choice.

Another candidate: ""DUPER"" invalid (E in 4).

""DUKER"" is valid.

""DUKER"" is a good choice.Based on the feedback so far:
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

The word must contain E and R, with E in positions 1, 2, or 3 and R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new untested letters is ""DUKER"".

Key deductions:

- I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- F and V are NOT in the word.
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, D, U, K, F, V.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R  
and the remaining letters must include I somewhere in positions 1, 3 (since it can’t be in 2).

Available letters (not eliminated): B, G, H, M, P, W, Y, I, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains I in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- I _ _ E R → “INNER” (N eliminated), “IMPER” (P allowed), “IGGIER” (too long), “ICIER” (C eliminated).
- _ I _ E R → “PIPER” (P allowed, P in 1, I in 2—but I can’t be in 2), “BIKER” (K eliminated), “HIDER” (D eliminated), “MIMER” (M allowed), “WIPER” (P allowed, W in 1, I in 2—but I can’t be in 2).

The only valid 5-letter words left seem to be:
- “IMPER” (I in 1, M, P, E, R) – but M and P are allowed.
- “MIMER” (M, I in 2, M, E, R) – but I can’t be in 2.

So “IMPER” is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

Check:

- All letters are allowed (no eliminated letters).
- Pattern matches _ _ _ E R.
- I is in the word and not in position 2.

Therefore, the next guess is “IMPER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A well-chosen first guess would cover several of these common letters without repeating any, to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it gives good coverage of common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, I need a word that:
1. Contains E (but not in the 5th spot).
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

A strong second guess would be “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are new letters.
- E is placed in position 4 instead of 5 to test its new location.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
CRONE → C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)

Key deductions:
1. Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N (x-feedback).
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - E (from both guesses, but in wrong positions)
   - R (from CRONE, wrong position)

So the secret word must contain both E and R, and neither E nor R can be in the positions we tried:
- E cannot be in position 5 (SLATE) or 4 (CRONE).
- R cannot be in position 2 (CRONE).

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, I, G, B, H, F, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and R.
- Places E in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since 4 and 5 are ruled out).
- Places R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since 2 is ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no S, L, A, T, C, O, N).

A good candidate is ""DRIER"":
- Contains both E and R.
- E is in position 3 (new spot).
- R is in positions 2 and 4 (but position 2 is ruled out for R, so this would give feedback on position 4).
- Uses new letters D and I (not yet tested).

However, ""DRIER"" has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So that's invalid.

Next candidate: ""FRESH"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 4 (but we know E can't be in 4 from CRONE), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""MERGE"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in positions 3 and 5 (position 5 is invalid), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""PERKY"":
- Contains E and R, but E is in position 2 (valid), R is in position 1 (valid).
- Uses new letters P and K, Y.
- This seems valid.

But let me check if ""PERKY"" has any eliminated letters: P, E, R, K, Y - none are eliminated. Good.

Another candidate: ""BERRY"":
- Contains E and R.
- E is in position 3 (valid), R is in positions 2 and 4 (position 2 is invalid for R), so invalid.

""GUIDE"" lacks R, so invalid.

""URBEN"" has E in position 5 (invalid).

""REBEL"" has E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 is invalid for E).

""FERRY"":
- E in positions 2 and 4 (position 4 invalid), R in positions 1 and 3 (position 3 is valid for R).
- Invalid due to E in 4.

""DIRER"":
- E in 3 (valid), R in 2 and 4 (position 2 invalid for R), so invalid.

""MERGE"" already ruled out.

""PERKY"" seems the best so far:
- E in position 2 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).
- Uses P, K, Y (new letters).

Another check: ""FRESH"" invalid (E in 4), ""DRIER"" invalid (R in 2), ""BERRY"" invalid (R in 2), ""REBEL"" invalid (E in 4).

""PERKY"" is valid.

But let me think of another: ""GRIPE"":
- E in position 5 (invalid), so no.

""CRIME"" has C and M (C is eliminated).

""PRISE"" has S (eliminated).

""BRIDE"":
- E in position 5 (invalid).

""DRIVE"":
- E in position 5 (invalid).

""PRIME"":
- E in position 5 (invalid).

""FRISE"" has S (eliminated).

""PRICE"" has C (eliminated).

""BRINE"" has N (eliminated).

""PRONE"" has O and N (both eliminated).

""FRISK"" has S (eliminated).

""PRIED"":
- E in position 4 (invalid).

""PRIME"" invalid (E in 5).

""PERKY"" seems the only valid option with E in 2 and R in 1, using new letters P, K, Y.

But wait, let me think of ""URBEN"" - but E is in 5 (invalid).

""MERGE"" invalid.

""FERRY"" invalid.

""DRIER"" invalid.

""CRANE"" has C and N (eliminated).

""GRAPE"" has G, A (A eliminated), P, E, but A is out.

""GRAPE"" invalid.

""GRIME"" has C (no, C is eliminated).

""GRIME"" has G, R, I, M, E - all allowed except R position?

Wait, ""GRIME"":

""PRIED"" E in 4 (invalid).

""PRIME"" E in 5 (invalid).

""FRIED"" E in 4 (invalid).

""CREPE"" C eliminated.

""CRISP"" S eliminated.

""CRUEL"" C and L eliminated.

""GUIDE"" invalid.

""FERRY"" invalid.

""FRESH"" invalid.

""FRISE"" invalid.

""PRIED"" invalid.

""PRIME"" invalid.

""PERKY"" seems the only valid guess that fits all constraints:
- Contains E and R.
- E in position 2 (valid), R in position 1 (valid).
- Uses new letters P, K, Y.

But let me check ""PERKY"" against all eliminated letters: P, E, R, K, Y - none are in the eliminated list. Good.

Another candidate: ""BRIEF"":
- E in position 4 (invalid).

""BRINE"" N eliminated.

""BRISK"" S eliminated.

""CRISP"" S and C eliminated.

""CRUEL"" C and L eliminated.

""DRIER"" R in 2 (invalid).

""FRIED"" E in 4 (invalid).

""FRESH"" E in 4 (invalid).

""FRISE"" S eliminated.

""GUIDE"" lacks R.

""MERGE"" E in 5 (invalid).

""MERIT"" lacks E.

""MERIT"" invalid.

""NICER"" N and C eliminated.

""NICER"" invalid.

""PRIME"" E in 5 (invalid).

""PRIED"" E in 4 (invalid).

""PRISE"" S eliminated.

""PRICE"" C eliminated.

""PRIZE"" Z uncommon, but valid.

""PRIZE"":
- E not present, so invalid.

""URBEN"" invalid.

""URGED"" lacks R in position 3 (but R is in 3, which is valid).

""URGED"":
- U, R, G, E, D.
- Contains E (position 4 - invalid) and R (position 2 - invalid).
- Invalid.

""URGED"" invalid.

""PERKY"" seems the only valid option.

But let me think of ""DUPER"":
- D, U, P, E, R.
- E in position 4 (invalid).

""DUKER"":
- E in position 3 (valid), R in position 5 (valid).
- Uses D, U, K, E, R - all allowed.
- This seems better than PERKY as it tests E in 3 and R in 5, and new letters D, U, K.

""DUKER"" is valid:
- E in 3 (valid), R in 5 (valid).
- No eliminated letters.

This seems a better choice.

Another candidate: ""DUPER"" invalid (E in 4).

""DUKER"" is valid.

""DUKER"" is a good choice.Based on the feedback so far:
- E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N.

The word must contain E and R, with E in positions 1, 2, or 3 and R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. A word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new untested letters is ""DUKER"".

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: DUKER -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(x) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

DUKER → D(x) U(x) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Key deductions:
1. E is now in the correct position (position 4).
2. R is now in the correct position (position 5).
3. The letters D, U, K are NOT in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ E R

We also know from earlier guesses that:
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, D, U, K
- Must include: E (position 4), R (position 5)
- No other constraints on positions for the remaining letters.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, F, G, H, I, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 1, 2, 3 with letters not in the eliminated list, forming a valid 5-letter word ending in ""ER"".

Possible candidates:
- B, F, G, H, I, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common words:
- F, I, M, P are frequent.

Possible words:
- F, I, M, P + ""ER""

Check:
- F, I, M, P are all allowed.
- Common words: F, I, M, P + ""ER"" → ""FIER"" is not 5 letters.
Wait, we need 5-letter words ending in ""ER"".

Examples:
- F, I, M, P as first three letters:
  - F I _ E R → ""F I V E R"" → ""FIVER"" (but V is allowed)
  - M I _ E R → ""M I N E R"" → ""MINER"" (N is eliminated)
  - P I _ E R → ""P I P E R"" → ""PIPER"" (P is allowed)
  - H I _ E R → ""H I Z E R"" → ""HIKER"" (K is eliminated)
  - F I V E R → ""FIVER"" (V is allowed)

""FIVER"" uses F, I, V, E, R - none of these letters are eliminated except V is new.

""PIPER"" uses P, I, P, E, R - P is allowed.

Both ""FIVER"" and ""PIPER"" fit, but ""PIPER"" is more common.

But let's check if ""PIPER"" is valid:
- P, I, P, E, R
- P is not eliminated.
- I is not eliminated.
- E and R are correct positions.

""FIVER"" is also valid, but ""PIPER"" is more common.

However, ""PIPER"" has P twice - is that allowed? Yes, letters can repeat.

But let's see if there's a better word.

Another candidate: ""W, I, V, E, R"" → ""W I V E R"" → ""WIVER"" (V is allowed).

""WIVER"" is also valid.

Between ""PIPER"", ""FIVER"", ""WIVER"", ""PIPER"" seems most common.

But let's check ""FIVER"" first:
- F, I, V, E, R
- F is new, I is new, V is new.
- This tests F, I, V.

""PIPER"" tests P, I.

""WIVER"" tests W, I, V.

""FIVER"" tests more new letters.

I'll go with ""FIVER"".

From the new feedback:

FIVER → F(x) I(-) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Key deductions:
- E and R are locked in positions 4 and 5.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- F and V are NOT in the word.
- Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, O, N, D, U, K, F, V.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E R  
and the remaining letters must include I somewhere in positions 1, 3 (since it can’t be in 2).

Available letters (not eliminated): B, G, H, M, P, W, Y, I, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains I in position 1 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- I _ _ E R → “INNER” (N eliminated), “IMPER” (P allowed), “IGGIER” (too long), “ICIER” (C eliminated).
- _ I _ E R → “PIPER” (P allowed, P in 1, I in 2—but I can’t be in 2), “BIKER” (K eliminated), “HIDER” (D eliminated), “MIMER” (M allowed), “WIPER” (P allowed, W in 1, I in 2—but I can’t be in 2).

The only valid 5-letter words left seem to be:
- “IMPER” (I in 1, M, P, E, R) – but M and P are allowed.
- “MIMER” (M, I in 2, M, E, R) – but I can’t be in 2.

So “IMPER” is the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

Check:
- I in 1 (allowed), M in 2, P in 3, E in 4, R in 5.
- All letters are allowed (no eliminated letters).
- Pattern matches _ _ _ E R.
- I is in the word and not in position 2.

Therefore, the next guess is “IMPER”.

and the remaining letters must include I somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 1, 4, or 5).

Available letters (not eliminated): B, G, H, W, Y, I, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains I in position 2 or 3.

Possible candidates:
- _ I _ E R → “BIKER” (K eliminated), “HIKER” (K eliminated), “PIKER” (K and P eliminated), “WIRED” (ends in ED), “WIPER” (P eliminated).
- _ _ I E R → “WIDER” (D eliminated), “HIGER”, “WIGER”, “WYGER” (none are valid words).

The only valid word left is “HIGER”:
- H, I, G, E, R
- H and G are allowed.
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- E and R are locked in place.
- No eliminated letters are used.

Therefore, the next guess is “HIGER”.

IMPER → I(-) M(x) P(x) E(✓) R(✓)

Key deductions:
1. E and R are locked in positions 4 and 5.
2. I is in the word but NOT in position 1.
3. M and P are NOT in the word.
