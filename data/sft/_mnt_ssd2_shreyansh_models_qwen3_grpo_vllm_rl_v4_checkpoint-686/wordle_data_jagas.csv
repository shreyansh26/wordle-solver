For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. Covers 5 unique letters, giving maximum information
2. Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
3. Includes common consonants (R, S) which are frequently found in English words
4. Has no repeated letters, which helps eliminate more possibilities

This should provide a good foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.

- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good letters to include next might be common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we have limited information, we should try to cover new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

A word like ""STAND"" comes to mind:
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed since we only know S is not in position 4).
- A is in position 3 (allowed since we only know A is not in position 1).

Another option is ""SLANT"":

- Does not contain R, O, or E.

- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- Tests new letters L, N, T.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. Covers 5 unique letters, giving maximum information
2. Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
3. Includes common consonants (R, S) which are frequently found in English words

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good letters to include next might be common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we have limited information, we should try to cover new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

A word like ""STAND"" comes to mind:
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed since we only know S is not in position 4).
- A is in position 3 (allowed since we only know A is not in position 1).
- New letters T, N, D are tested.

Another option is ""SLANT"":
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- Tests new letters L, N, T.

Between these, ""SLANT"" tests slightly more common letters (L, N, T) and has a better distribution. I'll go with SLANT.

- A is confirmed in position 2.
- S is confirmed in position 5.
- G is in the word but not in position 1.
- M and B are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- _ A _ _ S

Letters already ruled out:
R, O, E, L, N, T, C, H, Y, M, B

Letters still available: D, F, G, I, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

G must appear somewhere in positions 2-4, but position 2 is A, so G must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. _ A G _ S
2. _ A _ G S

Let's try _ A G _ S first. The missing letter (position 4) must be from the available letters.

Possible candidates:
- DAGGS – but G repeats, which is allowed, but let's see if we can find a better one.
- FAGGS – same issue.
- KAGGS – same.

Actually, let's think of valid words. ""DAGGS"" is a surname but might not be ideal. ""PAGGS"" is similar. 

Let's try _ A _ G S pattern. Then position 3 must be a single letter from available letters.

Possible candidates:
- VAGUS – U is allowed, but S is already in position 5.
- FAGGS – again G repeats.
- KAGWS – not a word.
- PAGDS – not a word.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ A _ _ S with G somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and no M, B, etc.

Looking at common words:
- ""VAGUS"" – but this is 5 letters: V-A-G-U-S. This fits _ A _ _ S, has G in position 3, and no banned letters. Also, V and U are new letters.

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- V: new, allowed
- A: confirmed in position 2
- G: must be in word, not in position 1, so position 3 is fine
- U: new, allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5

No conflicts.

- S is confirmed in position 5.
- G is in the word but not in position 1.
- M and B are not in the word.

Current known pattern:
- _ A _ _ S

Letters already ruled out:
R, O, E, L, N, T, C, H, Y, M, B

Letters still available: D, F, G, I, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

G must appear somewhere in positions 2-4, but position 2 is A, so G must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. _ A G _ S
2. _ A _ G S

Let's try _ A G _ S first. The missing letter (position 4) must be from the available letters.

Possible candidates:
- DAGGS – but G repeats, which is allowed, but let's see if we can find a better one.
- FAGGS – same issue.
- KAGGS – same.

Actually, let's think of valid words. ""DAGGS"" is a surname but might not be ideal. ""PAGGS"" is similar. 

Let's try _ A _ G S pattern. Then position 3 must be a single letter from available letters.

Possible candidates:
- VAGUS – U is allowed, but S is already in position 5.
- FAGGS – again G repeats.
- KAGWS – not a word.
- PAGDS – not a word.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ A _ _ S with G somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and no M, B, etc.

Looking at common words:
- ""VAGUS"" – but this is 5 letters: V-A-G-U-S. This fits _ A _ _ S, has G in position 3, and no banned letters. Also, V and U are new letters.

This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- V: new, allowed
- A: confirmed in position 2
- G: must be in word, not in position 1, so position 3 is fine
- U: new, allowed
- S: confirmed in position 5

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

Let me think about why this is a good choice:
1. Covers 5 unique letters, giving maximum information
2. Includes common vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
3. Includes common consonants (R, S) which are frequently found in English words
4. Has no repeated letters, which helps eliminate more possibilities

This should provide a good foundation for narrowing down the secret word in subsequent guesses based on the feedback received.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4.

Good letters to include next might be common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since we have limited information, we should try to cover new common letters while satisfying the constraints.

A word like ""STAND"" comes to mind:
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed since we only know S is not in position 4).
- A is in position 3 (allowed since we only know A is not in position 1).
- New letters T, N, D are tested.

Another option is ""SLANT"":
- Contains S and A.
- Does not contain R, O, or E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- Tests new letters L, N, T.

Between these, ""SLANT"" tests slightly more common letters (L, N, T) and has a better distribution. I'll go with SLANT.

Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLANT → S(-) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Known facts so far:
- Letters in the word: A, S.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A and S, avoids the excluded letters, and respects the positional bans.

Candidate word: “CHASE”
- Uses A and S.
- H, C are new letters.
- S is in position 4 → banned (feedback says S is not in position 4).  
  ❌ reject.

Candidate word: “MADSY” (slang, not standard) – avoid non-words.

Candidate word: “CASHY” – Y is allowed, but H is new.  
- C, H, Y are new.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No excluded letters.  

Looks good.

   - L, N, T are out.
   - A is not in position 3.

3. CASHY → C(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)
   - A is in position 2 and is correct.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, H, Y are out.

Current constraints:
- Word must have A in position 2.
- Must contain S somewhere other than positions 1, 3, 4.
- Must avoid letters: R, O, E, L, N, T, C, H, Y.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
But position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ S

Remaining unused common consonants: D, G, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Try “GAMBS”:
- G, M, B are new letters.
- Fits _ A _ _ S.
- Contains no banned letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).

Looks valid.

From the feedback on VAGUS:

- A is confirmed in position 2.
- G is confirmed in position 3.
- S is confirmed in position 5.
- V and U are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ A G _ S

Letters already ruled out:
R, O, E, L, N, T, C, H, Y, M, B, V, U

Available letters for positions 1 and 4:
D, F, I, K, P, Q, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A G _ S.

Possible candidates:
- DAGGS – G repeats, but G is already confirmed.
- FAGGS – same issue.
- KAGWS – not a word.
- PAGDS – not a word.

Looking at the pattern _ A G _ S, the only common word that fits is ""DAGGS"" (a surname), but it has a repeated G. However, the rules don't forbid repeated letters unless they're ruled out, and G is confirmed.

But let's check if there's a better fit. Actually, ""DAGGS"" is valid, but maybe there's another word.

Wait, ""FAGGS"" is similar. However, these are both surnames. 

Looking more carefully, the word must be _ A G _ S. The only common word is ""DAGGS"". 

But let's verify:
- D: new, allowed
- A: position 2 ✓
- G: position 3 ✓
- G: position 4 (but we only have one G in the word? No, the word can have repeated letters unless they're ruled out. G is confirmed in position 3, and position 4 could be another G.)

""DAGGS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a surname or a small fish.

Since this is the 5th guess and we're very close, let's go with DAGGS.

But wait, let's check if there's a word without repeating G. The pattern is _ A G _ S. The fourth letter must be from available letters: D, F, I, K, P, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for words:
- ""FAGGS"" – not standard.
- ""KAGWS"" – not a word.
- ""PAGDS"" – not a word.
- ""WAGHS"" – not a word.
- ""DAGGS"" – seems to be the only valid surname.

Given the constraints, DAGGS is the best next guess.

But let's think of ""KAGWS"" – no, that's not a word. 

Actually, ""PAGDS"" is not valid. 

The only valid word fitting _ A G _ S is ""DAGGS"".

However, let's check ""FAGGS"" – it's a surname but might not be in the word list. 

Given the constraints, ""DAGGS"" is the most plausible.

But let me reconsider. The word must be _ A G _ S. The fourth letter must be from available letters: D, F, I, K, P, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- ""FAGGS"" – valid surname.
- ""DAGGS"" – valid surname.
- ""KAGWS"" – invalid.
- ""PAGDS"" – invalid.

Between FAGGS and DAGGS, both are valid. Let's choose DAGGS.

But wait, let's check if there's a standard word. Actually, ""FAGGS"" is more common as a surname. 

But to maximize chances, let's go with ""DAGGS"".

However, upon reflection, ""DAGGS"" is a valid word. Let's proceed.

But let me verify the pattern: _ A G _ S. The word ""DAGGS"" is D-A-G-G-S, which fits.

Thus, the next guess is DAGGS.
</think>

Based on the confirmed positions and letters:
- Position 2: A ✓
- Position 3: G ✓
- Position 5: S ✓
- Pattern: _ A G _ S

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern with the remaining allowed letters is ""DAGGS"".

Looking more carefully, the word must be _ A G _ S. The only common word is ""DAGGS"". 

But let's verify:
- D: new, allowed
- A: position 2 ✓
- G: position 3 ✓
- G: position 4 (but we only have one G in the word? No, the word can have repeated letters unless they're ruled out. G is confirmed in position 3, and position 4 could be another G.)

""DAGGS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a surname or a small fish.

Since this is the 5th guess and we're very close, let's go with DAGGS.

But wait, let's check if there's a word without repeating G. The pattern is _ A G _ S. The fourth letter must be from available letters: D, F, I, K, P, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for words:
- ""FAGGS"" – not standard.
- ""KAGWS"" – not a word.
- ""PAGDS"" – not a word.
- ""WAGHS"" – not a word.
- ""DAGGS"" – seems to be the only valid surname.

Given the constraints, DAGGS is the best next guess.

But let's think of ""KAGWS"" – no, that's not a word. 

Actually, ""PAGDS"" is not valid. 

The only valid word fitting _ A G _ S is ""DAGGS"".

However, let's check ""FAGGS"" – it's a surname but might not be in the word list. 

Given the constraints, ""DAGGS"" is the most plausible.

But let me reconsider. The word must be _ A G _ S. The fourth letter must be from available letters: D, F, I, K, P, Q, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- ""FAGGS"" – valid surname.
- ""DAGGS"" – valid surname.
- ""KAGWS"" – invalid.
- ""PAGDS"" – invalid.

Between FAGGS and DAGGS, both are valid. Let's choose DAGGS.

But wait, let's check if there's a standard word. Actually, ""FAGGS"" is more common as a surname. 

But to maximize chances, let's go with ""DAGGS"".

However, upon reflection, ""DAGGS"" is a valid word. Let's proceed.

But let me verify the pattern: _ A G _ S. The word ""DAGGS"" is D-A-G-G-S, which fits.

Thus, the next guess is DAGGS.Based on the confirmed positions and letters:
- Position 2: A ✓
- Position 3: G ✓
- Position 5: S ✓
- Pattern: _ A G _ S

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern with the remaining allowed letters is ""DAGGS"".",Guess 6: DAGGS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) G(✓) G(-) S(✓),FAIL
