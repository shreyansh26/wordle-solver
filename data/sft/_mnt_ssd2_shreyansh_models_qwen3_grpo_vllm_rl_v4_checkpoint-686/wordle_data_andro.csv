- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. This can give us good information about multiple letters and their positions. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a classic strong opener that covers many common letters and vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S and E are not in the word at all (x)

So the secret word looks like: A _ _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word: A, R, O
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, E

We need to place R and O somewhere in positions 2-5, and we still need two more letters (not S or E). Common remaining consonants could be T, N, L, C, etc. and other vowels could be I or U.

Possible structures:
- A R O _ _
- A _ R O _
- A _ _ R O
- A _ O R _
- A O _ R _
- A O R _ _

Let's try a word that uses R and O in new positions and adds common consonants. ""AROMA"" is invalid because it repeats A. ""ABORT"" uses B (unknown) and T (common). ""ACORN"" uses C and N (common). ""ALARM"" repeats A. ""ADORN"" uses D and N.

""ADORN"" seems good - A is fixed, D and N are common, and it places R and O in new positions.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 1.
2. R is in the word and is now known to be in position 4 (from ADORN feedback: R(✓)).
3. O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from both guesses), so O must be in position 5.
4. D, N are in the word but in wrong positions (so they must appear elsewhere).
5. S, E are not in the word.

So the word structure is:
A _ _ R O

Letters still needed: two more letters, neither D nor N (since they’re already confirmed present but in wrong spots). Common remaining consonants: T, L, C, M, B, G, H, etc.

We have:
- D must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 1,4,5).
- N must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be in 1,4,5).

So positions 2 and 3 must be D and N in some order.

Possible words:
- A D N R O → “ADNRO” (invalid, not a word)
- A N D R O → “ANDRO” (valid word? Yes, “andro-” is a prefix, but 5-letter word “andro” is rare)
- A D N R O is invalid, but “ADNRO” isn’t a word.

Wait, we can rearrange D and N: positions 2 and 3 must be D and N. The only valid English word is “ANDRO” (though it’s more of a prefix). 

But “ANDRO” is 5 letters: A N D R O.

Check if it fits all constraints:
- A(✓) in position 1
- N in position 2 (but feedback said N(-) in ADORN, meaning N is in word but not position 5, which is true here)
- D in position 3 (feedback said D(-) in ADORN, meaning D is in word but not position 2, which is true here)
- R(✓) in position 4
- O in position 5 (matches O(-) from both guesses, since O can’t be in positions 2,3,4)

Thus, the only possible word is ANDRO.

But wait, is “ANDRO” a valid 5-letter English word? It’s listed as a variant of “androgyne” but is rare. However, Wordle/Word-games often accept it.

Alternatively, is there another word? Let’s think:

We have A _ _ R O, with D and N in positions 2-3. Only possible arrangement is A N D R O or A D N R O. “ADNRO” isn’t valid, so “ANDRO” is the only candidate.

Thus, the next guess should be ANDRO.
