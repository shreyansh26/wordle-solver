For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- It must contain S (but not in position 4).
- It must NOT contain A, R, E.

Common letters still worth trying: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that keeps O in position 3, uses S in a different spot, and introduces new common letters. “POINT” fits:

- O stays in position 3.
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once more letters are narrowed down.

Let's update what we know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: POINT  
P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
- P, I, N, T are not in the word.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which we already knew, since we know it's in position 3).

So the pattern is definitely: _ _ O _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S (not in position 4).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, N, T.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- keeps O in position 3,  
- uses S in a new position (1 or 2 or 5),  
- introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Let's try ""CLOUD"":
- C, L, U, D are all new letters.  
- O is in position 3 (correct).  
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once we have more constraints.

Wait, that doesn't use S. Let me rethink.

I need to include S. The word must be _ _ O _ _ and include S, but S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SOUTH"":
- S in position 1 (new).  
- O in position 3 (correct).  
- U, T, H are new letters, but T is already excluded (from POINT feedback). So T is out.

Next try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1.  
- H, C, K are new letters.  
- O in position 3.  
- No excluded letters (A,R,E,P,I,N,T are avoided).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- It must contain S (but not in position 4).
- It must NOT contain A, R, E.

Common letters still worth trying: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that keeps O in position 3, uses S in a different spot, and introduces new common letters. “POINT” fits:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O stays in position 3.
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once more letters are narrowed down.

Let's update what we know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: POINT  
P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
- P, I, N, T are not in the word.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which we already knew, since we know it's in position 3).

So the pattern is definitely: _ _ O _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S (not in position 4).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, N, T.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- keeps O in position 3,  
- uses S in a new position (1 or 2 or 5),  
- introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Let's try ""CLOUD"":
- C, L, U, D are all new letters.  
- O is in position 3 (correct).  
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once we have more constraints.

Wait, that doesn't use S. Let me rethink.

I need to include S. The word must be _ _ O _ _ and include S, but S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SOUTH"":
- S in position 1 (new).  
- O in position 3 (correct).  
- U, T, H are new letters, but T is already excluded (from POINT feedback). So T is out.

Next try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1.  
- H, C, K are new letters.  
- O in position 3.  
- No excluded letters (A,R,E,P,I,N,T are avoided).

This seems good.

Possible combinations:

- Position 4: same set, must be different from position 2.

Looking for common words:
- S D O D S – not valid.  
- S F O O S – not valid.  
- S G O O S – not valid.  
- S M O K S – K excluded.  
- S M O D S – “SMODS” is not a standard word.

Try “SWORD” – but we need S _ O _ S.

The only common word that fits is “SPOOR” – but P is excluded.  
Next: “SFOGS” – not a word.  
“SGOFS” – not a word.  
“SMOGS” – K is excluded, but G is allowed.  
“SMOGS” is a valid word (plural of smog), and letters are: S M O G S.

So “SMOGS” is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: “SUGOS” – not valid.  
“SUDOS” – valid (plural of sudor), letters S U D O S.

- Position 2: D, F, G, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z  
- Position 4: same set, must be different from position 2.

Looking for common words:
- S D O D S – not valid.  
- S F O O S – not valid.  
- S G O O S – not valid.  
- S M O K S – K excluded.  
- S M O D S – “SMODS” is not a standard word.  
- S W O O S – not valid.  
- S Q O O S – not valid.  
- S U O D S – not valid.  
- S V O D S – not valid.  
- S W O D S – not valid.  
- S D O M S – “SDOMS” not valid.  
- S D O G S – “SDOGS” not valid.  
- S D O V S – “SDOVS” not valid.  
- S D O Q S – “SDOQS” not valid.  
- S D O Y S – “SDOYS” not valid.  
- S D O Z S – “SDOZS” not valid.

Let’s try “SPOOR” – but P is excluded.  
Try “SWORD” – but we need S _ O _ S.  
Wait, we need exactly S _ O _ S.

The only common word that fits is “SPOOR” – but P is excluded.  
Next: “SFOGS” – not a word.  
“SGOFS” – not a word.  
“SMOGS” – K is excluded, but G is allowed.  
“SMOGS” is a valid word (plural of smog), and letters are: S M O G S.  
Check exclusions: M and G are not in the excluded list.

So “SMOGS” is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: “SUGOS” – not valid.  
“SUDOS” – valid (plural of sudor), letters S U D O S.  
Check exclusions: U and D are allowed.

Between “SMOGS” and “SUDOS”, both fit. “SUDOS” uses U and D, which are both allowed.  
Let’s choose “SUDOS”.",Guess 5: SUDOS -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(x) D(x) O(-) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere other than position 4.

So far we know:
- The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
- It must contain S (but not in position 4).
- It must NOT contain A, R, E.

Common letters still worth trying: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that keeps O in position 3, uses S in a different spot, and introduces new common letters. “POINT” fits:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O stays in position 3.
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once more letters are narrowed down.

<|im_end|>

Let's update what we know from both guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)  
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- A, R, E are not in the word at all.

Guess 2: POINT  
P(x) O(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
- P, I, N, T are not in the word.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (which we already knew, since we know it's in position 3).

So the pattern is definitely: _ _ O _ _

Letters we know are in the word: S (not in position 4).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, N, T.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- keeps O in position 3,  
- uses S in a new position (1 or 2 or 5),  
- introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Let's try ""CLOUD"":
- C, L, U, D are all new letters.  
- O is in position 3 (correct).  
- S is not used here, but we can test S in a future guess once we have more constraints.

Wait, that doesn't use S. Let me rethink.

I need to include S. The word must be _ _ O _ _ and include S, but S cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SOUTH"":
- S in position 1 (new).  
- O in position 3 (correct).  
- U, T, H are new letters, but T is already excluded (from POINT feedback). So T is out.

Next try ""SHOCK"":
- S in position 1.  
- H, C, K are new letters.  
- O in position 3.  
- No excluded letters (A,R,E,P,I,N,T are avoided).

This seems good.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known pattern: _ _ O _ _  (O is fixed in position 3).

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- S (now shown to be in position 1: S ✓)
- O (position 3, already confirmed)

Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
A, R, E, P, I, N, T, H, C, K

So the word looks like: S _ O _ _

We need two more letters, neither of which are any of the excluded ones.  
Available consonants: B, D, F, G, L, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (only vowel left that hasn’t been ruled out)

We also know S is already in position 1, so the remaining S cannot appear again (since letters don’t repeat unless we see a double ✓).

Let’s pick common remaining letters: D and L are frequent and still allowed.

Candidate: S D O L _  → “SDOL_” – not a word.  
Try S _ O _ _ with D and L: S D O O L? No, O repeats.  
Next: S L O B _? B is allowed. “SLOB_” – not a word.  
Try S L O G _ → “SLOG_” – not a word.  
Try S M O K _ – K is excluded.  
Try S L O P _ – P is excluded.  
Try S L O U D – “SL oud” → “SL oud” isn’t a word, but “SLOUD” isn’t valid.  
Try “SLOTH” – H is excluded.  
Try “SLOBS” – B and S are allowed, but S already used once and position 5 is new.  
“SLOBS” is a valid word and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s check: S L O B S  
- S ✓ in position 1 (matches)  
- L new  
- O ✓ in position 3  
- B new  
- S new position 5 – no conflict with earlier feedback (we only know S is not in position 4).

This tests B and L while keeping the known letters in place.

From the new feedback on SLOBS:

S(✓)  – S is correct in position 1.  
L(x) – L is not in the word.  
O(✓) – O is correct in position 3.  
B(x) – B is not in the word.  
S(✓) – the final S is also correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined: S _ O _ S

Letters still excluded: A, R, E, P, I, N, T, H, C, K, L, B  
Allowed letters for position 2 and 4: D, F, G, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z

We need two different letters from that set to fill positions 2 and 4, forming a valid English word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2: D, F, G, M, Q, U, V, W, Y, Z  
- Position 4: same set, must be different from position 2.

Looking for common words:
- S D O D S – not valid.  
- S F O O S – not valid.  
- S G O O S – not valid.  
- S M O K S – K excluded.  
- S M O D S – “SMODS” is not a standard word.

- S D O Z S – “SDOZS” not valid.

Let’s try “SPOOR” – but P is excluded.  
Try “SWORD” – but we need S _ O _ S.  
Wait, we need exactly S _ O _ S.

The only common word that fits is “SPOOR” – but P is excluded.  
Next: “SFOGS” – not a word.  
“SGOFS” – not a word.  
“SMOGS” – K is excluded, but G is allowed.
