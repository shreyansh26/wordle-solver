For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has S and R which are also very common
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters in the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E exactly once each.
2. Does NOT use A or R.
3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidate letters to add (since we haven’t tested many of them yet): T, L, N, I, C, D, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that shifts the known letters to new positions and introduces a couple of fresh consonants. One such word is “STONE”:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- T is a new letter.
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 3).
- N is a new letter.
- E is now in position 5 – but E was ruled out of position 5 in AROSE, so this is invalid.

So “STONE” fails because E would be in position 5 again.

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- N, I, C are new letters.
- C is new, but we already know we need E somewhere.

Wait, we must include E. So let’s try “OCEAN” – but A is already ruled out.

Next: “SPOKE”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- K is new.
- E in 5 – but E was ruled out of 5 in AROSE. So invalid.

Next: “POSED”
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- S in 3 – but S was only ruled out of 4, so 3 is allowed.
- E in 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of 5).
- D is new.

This looks valid:
- Contains O, S, E each once, none in previously ruled-out positions.
- Does not contain A or R.
- Introduces P and D (two new letters).

So “POSED” is a good next guess.

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from AROSE and POSED). So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and POSED). So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

A valid word that fits is “OCEAN”, but A is ruled out.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has S and R which are also very common
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters in the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E exactly once each.
2. Does NOT use A or R.
3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidate letters to add (since we haven’t tested many of them yet): T, L, N, I, C, D, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that shifts the known letters to new positions and introduces a couple of fresh consonants. One such word is “STONE”:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- T is a new letter.
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 3).
- N is a new letter.
- E is now in position 5 – but E was ruled out of position 5 in AROSE, so this is invalid.

So “STONE” fails because E would be in position 5 again.

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- N, I, C are new letters.
- C is new, but we already know we need E somewhere.

Wait, we must include E. So let’s try “OCEAN” – but A is already ruled out.

Next: “SPOKE”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- K is new.
- E in 5 – but E was ruled out of 5 in AROSE. So invalid.

Next: “POSED”
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- S in 3 – but S was only ruled out of 4, so 3 is allowed.
- E in 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of 5).
- D is new.

This looks valid:
- Contains O, S, E each once, none in previously ruled-out positions.
- Does not contain A or R.
- Introduces P and D (two new letters).

So “POSED” is a good next guess.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

What we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D  
Letters definitely in the word: O, S, E  
Exact positions we can rule out:
- O is in the word and is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 2 (from POSED). So O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from AROSE and POSED). So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and POSED). So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We still need to place O, S, E in the remaining slots while introducing new letters that haven’t been tested yet (common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, B, etc.).

Let’s try a word that:
- puts O in position 1 (a new spot),
- puts S in position 2 (a new spot),
- puts E in position 3 (a new spot),
- fills the last two positions with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate: O S E _ _ → “OSE TN”… but we need real words.

A valid word that fits is “OCEAN”, but A is ruled out.  
Next: “ONSEN” – but N is repeated and not ideal.

Another pattern: place O in 4, S in 1, E in 2: S E _ O _  
A word like “SETO_” – but we need a valid word.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but C is new, I is new, N is new, but we already know we need E somewhere.  
Actually, we must include E.

A word that satisfies:
- S in 1,
- E in 2,
- O in 4,
- new letters in 3 and 5.

“SETO_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  
“SETON” is valid: S E T O N.  
Check:
- S in 1 (allowed),
- E in 2 (allowed),
- O in 4 (allowed),
- T and N are new letters.

So “SETON” is a good next guess.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): A, R, P, D, T

Positions ruled out so far:

- S: not 3, 4, 1

Therefore the only remaining legal positions are:

S: must be in position 5  
E: must be in position 1 or 3  
O: must be in position 1 or 5  

But S is already forced into position 5, so O cannot go into position 5.  
Hence O must be in position 1, and that leaves E for position 3.

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Letters definitely NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, P, D, T, M

Letters definitely IN the word (✓):
O, S, E

Position restrictions from all feedback:

S:
- NOT in 1 (SETON feedback)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (POSED)
- NOT in 5 (OMENS says S is in 5 but shows “✓” for position 5, so this is actually correct – S is in position 5)
Wait, OMENS feedback shows S(✓) at position 5, so S is fixed at position 5.

So S is locked in position 5.

O:
- NOT in 2 (POSED)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (SETON)
- NOT in 1 (OMENS shows O(-) at 1, so O is NOT in 1)

Therefore O must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by S. This is impossible.  
Hence my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining OMENS feedback:
O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 1.
M(x) – M not in word.
E(-) – E is in word but NOT in position 3.
N(-) – N is in word but NOT in position 4.
S(✓) – S is in position 5 and is correct.

So S is fixed at position 5.

Now for O:
- NOT in 1 (from OMENS)
- NOT in 2 (from POSED)
- NOT in 3 (from AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (from SETON)

Thus O has no legal position left. This contradiction shows I misread earlier feedback.

Going back to SETON feedback:
Feedback was S(-) E(-) T(x) O(-) N(-)

The “-” for O in SETON means O is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Correct position deductions:

O:
- NOT in 2 (POSED)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (SETON)
- NOT in 1 (OMENS shows O(-) at 1)

Hence O must be in position 5, but position 5 is S.  
This contradiction implies an inconsistency in my interpretation.

Realization: The feedback symbols are per-position relative to each guess, not absolute.  
Let me re-tabulate positions for each letter:

For O:
- In AROSE (position 3) → (-) → O in word, not at 3
- In POSED (position 2) → (✓) → O is at 2
- In SETON (position 4) → (-) → O in word, not at 4
- In OMENS (position 1) → (-) → O in word, not at 1

So from POSED we have O at position 2. This is absolute.

For S:
- In AROSE (position 4) → (-) → S in word, not at 4
- In POSED (position 3) → (-) → S in word, not at 3
- In SETON (position 1) → (-) → S in word, not at 1
- In OMENS (position 5) → (✓) → S is at 5

So S is fixed at 5.

For E:
- In AROSE (position 5) → (-) → E in word, not at 5
- In POSED (position 4) → (✓) → E is at 4
- In SETON (position 2) → (-) → E in word, not at 2
- In OMENS (position 3) → (-) → E in word, not at 3

From POSED we have E at position 4 (absolute).

So far we have:
- Position 2: O (from POSED)
- Position 4: E (from POSED)
- Position 5: S (from OMENS)

Word pattern: _ _ _ E S

Letters used so far: O, E, S  
Letters ruled out: A, R, P, D, T, M, N (from SETON N(-))

Remaining letters to try in positions 1 and 3: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, L, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in ES with O in position 2 and E in position 4:
The pattern is: _ O _ E S

Valid words: “BOGES”, “COGES”, “COVES”, “COZES”, “FOGES”, “HOLES”, “LODES”, “MOGES”, “VOGES” – but many are not valid or contain ruled-out letters.

Checking:
- “COVES”: C, O, V, E, S – V is new, letters not ruled out.
- “LODES”: L, O, D, E, S – D is ruled out.
- “BOGES”: B, O, G, E, S – valid.

“COVES” seems valid and uses new letters C and V.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""SOARE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It has S and R which are also very common
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving maximum information
- It's a valid 5-letter English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters in the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E (each once).
- It does NOT contain A or R.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E exactly once each.
2. Does NOT use A or R.
3. Places O, S, E in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidate letters to add (since we haven’t tested many of them yet): T, L, N, I, C, D, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that shifts the known letters to new positions and introduces a couple of fresh consonants. One such word is “STONE”:
- S is now in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- T is a new letter.
- O is now in position 2 (allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 3).
- N is a new letter.
- E is now in position 5 – but E was ruled out of position 5 in AROSE, so this is invalid.

So “STONE” fails because E would be in position 5 again.

Next candidate: “SONIC”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- O in 2 (allowed).
- N, I, C are new letters.
- C is new, but we already know we need E somewhere.

Wait, we must include E. So let’s try “OCEAN” – but A is already ruled out.

Next: “SPOKE”
- S in 1 (allowed).
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- K is new.
- E in 5 – but E was ruled out of 5 in AROSE. So invalid.

Next: “POSED”
- P is new.
- O in 2 (allowed).
- S in 3 – but S was only ruled out of 4, so 3 is allowed.
- E in 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of 5).
- D is new.

This looks valid:
- Contains O, S, E each once, none in previously ruled-out positions.
- Does not contain A or R.
- Introduces P and D (two new letters).

So “POSED” is a good next guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)

What we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D  
Letters definitely in the word: O, S, E  
Exact positions we can rule out:
- O is in the word and is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and is NOT in position 2 (from POSED). So O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from AROSE and POSED). So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and POSED). So E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

We still need to place O, S, E in the remaining slots while introducing new letters that haven’t been tested yet (common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, B, etc.).

Let’s try a word that:
- puts O in position 1 (a new spot),
- puts S in position 2 (a new spot),
- puts E in position 3 (a new spot),
- fills the last two positions with new letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate: O S E _ _ → “OSE TN”… but we need real words.

A valid word that fits is “OCEAN”, but A is ruled out.  
Next: “ONSEN” – but N is repeated and not ideal.

Another pattern: place O in 4, S in 1, E in 2: S E _ O _  
A word like “SETO_” – but we need a valid word.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but C is new, I is new, N is new, but we already know we need E somewhere.  
Actually, we must include E.

A word that satisfies:
- S in 1,
- E in 2,
- O in 4,
- new letters in 3 and 5.

“SETO_” – but we need a 5-letter word.  
“SETON” is valid: S E T O N.  
Check:
- S in 1 (allowed),
- E in 2 (allowed),
- O in 4 (allowed),
- T and N are new letters.

So “SETON” is a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): A, R, P, D, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓): O, S, E  

Positions ruled out so far:

- S: not 3, 4, 1  
- E: not 4, 5, 2  
- O: not 2, 3, 4  

Therefore the only remaining legal positions are:

S: must be in position 5  
E: must be in position 1 or 3  
O: must be in position 1 or 5  

But S is already forced into position 5, so O cannot go into position 5.  
Hence O must be in position 1, and that leaves E for position 3.

Current pattern:  
O _ E S _  

We still need one more letter in position 2.  
Letters already used / ruled out: A, R, P, D, T  
Remaining common consonants: N, L, C, B, G, M, etc.

A valid English word that fits O _ E S _ is “OCEAN” – but A is ruled out.  
“OBES_” – B is allowed, but we need a 5-letter word.  
“OLVES” – but L and V are allowed, but we need to check if it’s valid.  
Wait, let’s try “OCEAN” again – A is out.  
“OGRES” – but R is out.  
“OMENS” – but M and N are allowed, and the word is valid.

Let’s check:  
O M E N S  

- O in 1 (allowed)  
- M is new  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- N is new  
- S in 5 (allowed)  

All constraints satisfied.

Let's extract every constraint we now have.

Letters definitely NOT in the word (✗):
A, R, P, D, T, M

Letters definitely IN the word (✓):
O, S, E

Position restrictions from all feedback:

S:
- NOT in 1 (SETON feedback)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (POSED)
- NOT in 5 (OMENS says S is in 5 but shows “✓” for position 5, so this is actually correct – S is in position 5)
Wait, OMENS feedback shows S(✓) at position 5, so S is fixed at position 5.

So S is locked in position 5.

O:
- NOT in 2 (POSED)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (SETON)
- NOT in 1 (OMENS shows O(-) at 1, so O is NOT in 1)

Therefore O must be in position 5, but position 5 is already taken by S. This is impossible.  
Hence my interpretation must be wrong.

Re-examining OMENS feedback:
O(-) means O is in the word but NOT in position 1.
M(x) – M not in word.
E(-) – E is in word but NOT in position 3.
N(-) – N is in word but NOT in position 4.
S(✓) – S is in position 5 and is correct.

So S is fixed at position 5.

Now for O:
- NOT in 1 (from OMENS)
- NOT in 2 (from POSED)
- NOT in 3 (from AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (from SETON)

Thus O has no legal position left. This contradiction shows I misread earlier feedback.

Going back to SETON feedback:
Feedback was S(-) E(-) T(x) O(-) N(-)

The “-” for O in SETON means O is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Correct position deductions:

O:
- NOT in 2 (POSED)
- NOT in 3 (AROSE)
- NOT in 4 (SETON)
- NOT in 1 (OMENS shows O(-) at 1)

Hence O must be in position 5, but position 5 is S.  
This contradiction implies an inconsistency in my interpretation.

Realization: The feedback symbols are per-position relative to each guess, not absolute.  
Let me re-tabulate positions for each letter:

For O:
- In AROSE (position 3) → (-) → O in word, not at 3
- In POSED (position 2) → (✓) → O is at 2
- In SETON (position 4) → (-) → O in word, not at 4
- In OMENS (position 1) → (-) → O in word, not at 1

So from POSED we have O at position 2. This is absolute.

For S:
- In AROSE (position 4) → (-) → S in word, not at 4
- In POSED (position 3) → (-) → S in word, not at 3
- In SETON (position 1) → (-) → S in word, not at 1
- In OMENS (position 5) → (✓) → S is at 5

So S is fixed at 5.

For E:
- In AROSE (position 5) → (-) → E in word, not at 5
- In POSED (position 4) → (✓) → E is at 4
- In SETON (position 2) → (-) → E in word, not at 2
- In OMENS (position 3) → (-) → E in word, not at 3

From POSED we have E at position 4 (absolute).

So far we have:
- Position 2: O (from POSED)
- Position 4: E (from POSED)
- Position 5: S (from OMENS)

Word pattern: _ _ _ E S

Letters used so far: O, E, S  
Letters ruled out: A, R, P, D, T, M, N (from SETON N(-))

Remaining letters to try in positions 1 and 3: common consonants like B, C, F, G, H, L, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in ES with O in position 2 and E in position 4:
The pattern is: _ O _ E S

Valid words: “BOGES”, “COGES”, “COVES”, “COZES”, “FOGES”, “HOLES”, “LODES”, “MOGES”, “VOGES” – but many are not valid or contain ruled-out letters.

Checking:
- “COVES”: C, O, V, E, S – V is new, letters not ruled out.
- “LODES”: L, O, D, E, S – D is ruled out.
- “BOGES”: B, O, G, E, S – valid.

“COVES” seems valid and uses new letters C and V.
