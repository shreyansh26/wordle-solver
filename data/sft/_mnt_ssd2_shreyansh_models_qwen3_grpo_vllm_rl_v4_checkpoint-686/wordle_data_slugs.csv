### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words are: STARE, CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, or ADIEU. These cover a broad range of common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is correct in position 2
- A, T, E are not in the word at all

So the word must be of the form:
S L _ _ _

and the remaining letters must not include A, T, or E.

Common consonants left: R, N, M, P, C, D, G, H, etc.
Common vowels left: I, O, U

Let’s try to fill the last three positions with common letters that haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is “SLING”:
- S(✓) L(✓) I(?) N(?) G(?)
This tests I, N, G which are all still possible.

Current constraints:
1. Word form: S L _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, I, N
3. G is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Possible positions for G: 3 or 4.

Remaining vowels: O, U
Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try placing G in position 3: S L G _ _
We need two more letters from the allowed set. Good candidates: O, U, R, C, etc.

A strong next guess is “SLUGS”:
- S(✓) L(✓) G(✓) U(?) S(?)
This tests G in position 3, U as the only remaining vowel, and S again (though we know S is already correct in position 1, this will confirm S is allowed in position 5 as well).

However, “SLUGS” repeats S, which might not be optimal. Instead, let’s try “SLUGS” or “SLURB” – but “SLURB” uses B which is less common.

A better choice is “SLUGS” to test U and G in position 3.

But wait, G must be in the word but not in position 5, so position 3 is valid. Let’s go with “SLUGS”.

Actually, let me reconsider: placing G in position 4 might give more information. Let’s try “SLURG” – but that’s not a valid word.

A valid word with G in position 4: “SLUGS” is valid, but let’s try “SLUMG” – invalid.

Another valid word: “SLUMP” – but P is less common. 

Let me think of common words: “SLOSH” – but H is less common. 

A good common word: “SLOTH” – but T is already ruled out.

Next option: “SLOBS” – but B is less common.

Another: “SLOPE” – but E is ruled out.

“SLOPS” – S is already in position 1, but S can appear again. However, this might not be optimal.

Let me try “SLOSH” – H is less common, but it’s a valid word.

Actually, let’s try “SLOSH” to test O, S (again), H, and S in position 5.

But to maximize information, let’s try “SLOSH”.

However, I realize “SLUGS” is a better choice as it tests U and G in position 3.
