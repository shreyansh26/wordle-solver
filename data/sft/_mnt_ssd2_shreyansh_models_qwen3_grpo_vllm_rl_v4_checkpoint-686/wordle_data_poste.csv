### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Let's update what we know after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- S (-) – in the word but not in position 4
- E (✓) – correct in position 5

From Guess 2 (SPOKE):
- S (-) – in the word but not in position 1
- P (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- O (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- K (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – still correct in position 5

Combining these facts:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- It must contain S, O, and P.
- S is not in positions 1 or 4.
- O is not in position 3.
- P is not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, K.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is E), so 2 or 3.
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for P: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to place them:
- If S is in position 2:
  - _ S _ _ E
  - O and P must fit in positions 1, 3, 4.
  - P cannot be in position 2 (already S), so P could be 1, 3, or 4.
  - O could be 1, 3, or 4, but not 3 (from earlier), so 1 or 4.

  Example: P S O _ E → but P is in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), O in 3 (invalid).  
  Try: O S P _ E → O in 1 (ok), S in 2 (ok), P in 3 (ok), but P was not allowed in 2, but 3 is ok.  
  However, we have 5 letters and need to fit O, S, P plus any other letters not excluded.  
  Let’s try ""POSE"" but it’s only 4 letters.  
  Need 5: ""POSSE"" – but S is already in 2, and we don’t know if S repeats.  
  ""POISE"" – I is new, but ok.  
  Check constraints: P not in 2 (ok, it's 1), O not in 3 (ok, it's 2), S not in 1 or 4 (it's 3, ok), E in 5.  
  ""POISE"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""POSSE"" – but double S, uncertain if allowed or helpful.
""POISE"" is better as it introduces I (new letter) and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- P in 1: allowed (feedback said P is in word but not in 2)
- O in 2: allowed (not in 3)
- I in 3: new letter, no feedback yet
- S in 4: but feedback says S is not in 4 (from AROSE) – oops, conflict!  
  In AROSE, S was in 4 with feedback (-), so S cannot be in 4.  
  Thus ""POISE"" is invalid because S would be in 4.

Re-evaluate:
S must be in 2 or 3.
Let’s try S in 3:
- _ _ S _ E
- O and P must fit in 1, 2, 4.
- P not in 2, O not in 3 (already).
Possible:
P in 1, O in 2 or 4:
- P O S _ E → ""POS_E"" – need 5th letter. ""POSSE"" again has S in 4 (invalid).
- P _ S O E – but O cannot be in 4 (no restriction against it), and P in 1, S in 3, O in 4.  
  Word: P _ S O E – missing letter in 2. Try ""PUSOE"" – not valid.
- O in 1, P in 4: O _ S P E – ""OISPE"" – invalid.

Alternative: S in 2:
- _ S _ _ E
- O and P in 1, 3, 4 with constraints:
  - P not in 2 (ok, it's 1,3, or 4)
  - O not in 3
Possible:
P in 1, O in 4: P S _ O E – ""PS_OE"" – need letter in 3. ""PSIOE"" – invalid.
O in 3 is invalid, so O in 1 or 4.
O in 1: O S _ _ E – need P in 3 or 4.
- O S P _ E – ""OS_P_E"" – ""OSPRE"" – invalid.
- O S _ P E – ""OS_P_E"" – ""OSTPE"" – invalid.

Try ""SPOKE"" feedback again: P was (-) so P is in word but not in 2.  
Let me think differently: list 5-letter words ending in E with S, O, P and no A, R, K.

Possible word: ""POSED"" – ends D, invalid.
""POSES"" – ends S, invalid.
""POSED"" – invalid.
""POISE"" – S in 4 (invalid).
""POSSE"" – S in 4 (invalid).
""SPIKE"" – ends K (invalid).
""SPITE"" – ends E, contains S, P, I, T, E. Check constraints:
- S in 1: but feedback says S not in 1 (from SPOKE) – invalid.
""STOPE"" – ends E, contains S, T, O, P, E:
- S in 1: invalid (from SPOKE)
""TOPES"" – ends S, invalid.
""TOPEE"" – ends E, contains T, O, P, E, E – double E, but ok.  
Check letters: T, O, P, E, E – no A, R, K.  
Constraints:
- E in 5: ok
- O: must be in 1,2,4 (not 3) – here O in 2: ok
- P: must be in 1,3,4 – here P in 3: ok
- S: must be in 2,3, but word is T O P E E – no S. Invalid.

Another candidate: ""STOPE"" – S, T, O, P, E:
- S in 1: invalid (from SPOKE)
""STOPE"" invalid.

""STOPE"" invalid, ""STOPE"" invalid.

Try ""TOSPE"" – invalid.

""POSSE"" invalid.

""POISE"" invalid.

""SPOKE"" invalid.

""SPOKE"" feedback: S(-) means S is in word but not in 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SPOKE).  
Thus S must be in 2 or 3.

Let me try S in 2:
- _ S _ _ E
- Must contain O and P.
- O not in 3, P not in 2.
Possible:
P in 1: P S O _ E – but O in 3 is invalid.
P in 3: _ S P _ E – O must fit in 1 or 4.
- O S P _ E – ""OS_P_E"" – ""OSPRE"" – invalid.
- _ S P O E – ""ISPOE"" – invalid.

O in 4: _ S _ O E – P must be 1 or 3.
- P S _ O E – ""PS_OE"" – ""PSIOE"" – invalid.
- _ S P O E – ""ISPOE"" – invalid.

S in 3:
- _ _ S _ E
- O and P in 1,2,4 with:
  - P not in 2
  - O not in 3 (already)
Possible:
P in 1, O in 2 or 4:
- P O S _ E – ""POS_E"" – ""POSSE"" – S in 4 invalid.
- P _ S O E – ""PUSOE"" – invalid.
O in 4: P _ S O E – same issue.

Alternative: O in 1, P in 4:
- O _ S P E – ""OS_P_E"" – ""OSTPE"" – invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe ""TOPEE"" is invalid because no S.

Wait, must include S, O, P, E, and one more letter (not A, R, K).

Possible word: ""SPOKE"" already tried.

""POSES"" – ends S, invalid.

""POSED"" – ends D, invalid.

""SPIKE"" – ends K, invalid.

""STOPE"" – ends E, contains S, T, O, P, E:
- S in 1: invalid (from SPOKE)
""STOPE"" invalid.

""TOPEE"" – no S.

""TOPSE"" – invalid.

""TOPLE"" – ends E, contains T, O, P, L, E:
- Check constraints:
  - E in 5: ok
  - O: must be in 1,2,4 (not 3) – here O in 2: ok
  - P: must be in 1,3,4 – here P in 3: ok
  - S: must be in 2,3, but word is T O P L E – no S: invalid.

""TOILE"" – contains I, no S: invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
- It does not contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Contains both O and S
3. Does not contain A or R
4. Has O not in position 3 and S not in position 4

Possible candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" - but contains R? No, but contains U which might be okay, but S is in position 4 which is invalid
- ""POSED"" - but ends with D, not E
- ""SPOKE"" - ends with E, contains S and O, but S is in position 1 (ok), O is in position 2 (ok), and does not contain A or R
- ""STOLE"" - contains S, T, O, L, E - but T and L are new letters, S is in position 1 (ok), O is in position 3 (invalid)
- ""SOWER"" - but contains R (invalid)
- ""SLOPE"" - contains S, L, O, P, E - S in position 1 (ok), O in position 3 (invalid)
- ""SONIC"" - but ends with C (invalid)
- ""SPOKE"" seems best: S P O K E - S not in position 4 (ok), O not in position 3 (ok), ends with E, no A or R

Possible positions for O, S, P:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is E, so 1, 2, or 4).
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1, 4, or 5).
- P can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E, so 1, 3, or 4).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words ending in E with O, S, P, avoiding A, R, K, and respecting the position constraints.

Some candidates:
- POISE: P(1), O(2), I(new), S(4), E(5). But S cannot be in 4, so invalid.
- SPOIL: ends with L, not E, invalid.
- SOPOR: ends with R, invalid.

  - Contains O, S, P.
  - O not in 3 (it’s in 2), S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3), P not in 2 (it’s in 1).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which appear in many English words. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So we know:
- The word ends with E
- It contains O and S, but O is not in position 3 and S is not in position 4
- It does not contain A or R

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E
2. Contains both O and S
3. Does not contain A or R
4. Has O not in position 3 and S not in position 4

Possible candidates:
- ""HOUSE"" - but contains R? No, but contains U which might be okay, but S is in position 4 which is invalid
- ""POSED"" - but ends with D, not E
- ""SPOKE"" - ends with E, contains S and O, but S is in position 1 (ok), O is in position 2 (ok), and does not contain A or R
- ""STOLE"" - contains S, T, O, L, E - but T and L are new letters, S is in position 1 (ok), O is in position 3 (invalid)
- ""SOWER"" - but contains R (invalid)
- ""SLOPE"" - contains S, L, O, P, E - S in position 1 (ok), O in position 3 (invalid)
- ""SONIC"" - but ends with C (invalid)
- ""SPOKE"" seems best: S P O K E - S not in position 4 (ok), O not in position 3 (ok), ends with E, no A or R

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in the correct position (last letter).
   - O and S are somewhere in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. SPOKE → S(-) P(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)
   - Confirms E is correct in position 5.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - P is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - K is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Letters definitely in the word: O, S, P.
- Letters definitely out: A, R, K.
- O cannot be in position 3.
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- P cannot be in position 2.

Possible positions for O, S, P:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is E, so 1, 2, or 4).
- S can be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1, 4, or 5).
- P can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E, so 1, 3, or 4).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words ending in E with O, S, P, avoiding A, R, K, and respecting the position constraints.

Some candidates:
- POISE: P(1), O(2), I(new), S(4), E(5). But S cannot be in 4, so invalid.
- SPOIL: ends with L, not E, invalid.
- SOPOR: ends with R, invalid.
- POSSE: P(1), O(2), S(3), S(4), E(5). S appears twice; we don’t know if S is unique.
- POSHE: P(1), O(2), S(3), H(new), E(5). This fits:
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains O, S, P.
  - O not in 3 (it’s in 2), S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3), P not in 2 (it’s in 1).
  - No A, R, K.

Let’s go with POSHE.

2. SPOKE → S(-) P(-) O(-) K(x) E(✓)
3. POSHE → P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) H(x) E(✓)

Key deductions:
- The word ends with E (position 5 ✓).
- P is in the correct position (position 1 ✓).
- O is in the correct position (position 2 ✓).
- S is in the correct position (position 3 ✓).
- H is not in the word (x).

So the word structure is: P O S _ E

We need a 5-letter word starting with POS and ending with E. The only common word that fits is ""POSEE"", but that's not a valid English word. However, ""POSSE"" is a valid word meaning a group of people or a large group. Let's check:
- P(1) ✓
- O(2) ✓
- S(3) ✓
- S(4) - we don't know if S is duplicated, but the feedback didn't mark it wrong
- E(5) ✓

""POSSE"" fits all constraints perfectly.

From the feedback on POSSE:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-) E(✓)

We now know:
1. The word starts with POS (positions 1-3 confirmed).
2. The last letter is E (position 5 confirmed).
3. The fourth letter is NOT S (the second S got a “-” feedback, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4).
4. The only remaining unused letter that is common in this position is T.

So the pattern is POS _ E with the blank letter being any unused letter that makes a valid word. The only common 5-letter word that fits is “POSTE”, but that is not a recognized English word. The next common candidate is “POSIT”, but that ends in T, not E. 

Wait—let me double-check: POS + T + E = POS TE → “POSET” is not valid. The correct word is “POSSE”, but we already tried that and it was rejected for position 4. 

Actually, the only valid word left is “POSTE” which is archaic but listed in some dictionaries, yet it’s not standard. The standard word that fits is “POSIT” but that ends in T. 

Hold on—let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with POS and ending with E:
- POSSE (already tried, S in 4 is invalid)
- POISE (ends with E, but I is unused and fits: P O I S E)

Let’s check POISE:
- P(✓) O(✓) I(new) S(?) E(✓)

From previous feedback:
- S must be in the word (from AROSE and SPOKE), and in POISE S is in position 4. 
- The feedback on S in position 4 from AROSE was (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. 

Thus POISE is invalid because S would be in position 4. 

Next candidate: POSLE (a type of fish), but L hasn’t been tested and it’s obscure. 

Next: POSVE (invalid). 

Next: POSBE (invalid). 

Next: POSGE (invalid). 

Next: POSKE (invalid, K already ruled out). 

Next: POSME (invalid). 

Next: POSNE (invalid). 

Next: POSRE (invalid, R already ruled out). 

Next: POSYE (invalid). 

Next: POSDE (invalid). 

Next: POSFE (invalid). 

Next: POSHE (invalid, H already ruled out). 

Next: POSIE (invalid). 

Next: POSLE (valid but obscure). 

Next: POSME (invalid). 

Next: POSNE (invalid). 

Next: POSPE (invalid). 

Next: POSSE (invalid, S in 4). 

Next: POSVE (invalid). 

Next: POSYE (invalid). 

Next: POSZE (invalid). 

The only remaining valid word that starts with POS and ends with E, uses S not in position 4, is “POSEE” which is invalid. 

Wait—let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback shows:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) means S is in position 3.
- So the word is P O S _ E.

We need a letter in position 4 that is not S and hasn’t been ruled out. From previous guesses, used letters: A, R, K, H. 

Possible unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, L, M, N, T.

Looking for POS _ E:
- POSBE (invalid)
- POSCE (invalid)
- POSDE (invalid)
- POSFE (invalid)
- POSGE (invalid)
- POSIE (invalid)
- POSLE (valid, but rare)
- POSME (invalid)
- POSNE (invalid)
- POSSE (invalid, S in 4)
- POSVE (invalid)
- POSZE (invalid)

The only valid word left is POSLE (a type of fish). Let’s check:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) L(?) E(✓)
- L hasn’t been tested yet and doesn’t conflict with any feedback.

Thus, the correct guess is POSLE.

<guess>POSLE</guess>",POSLE,"From the feedback on POSSE:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-) E(✓)

We now know:
1. The word starts with POS (positions 1-3 confirmed).
2. The last letter is E (position 5 confirmed).
3. The fourth letter is NOT S (the second S got a “-” feedback, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4).
4. The only remaining unused letter that is common in this position is T.

So the pattern is POS _ E with the blank letter being any unused letter that makes a valid word. The only common 5-letter word that fits is “POSTE”, but that is not a recognized English word. The next common candidate is “POSIT”, but that ends in T, not E. 

Wait—let me double-check: POS + T + E = POS TE → “POSET” is not valid. The correct word is “POSSE”, but we already tried that and it was rejected for position 4. 

Actually, the only valid word left is “POSTE” which is archaic but listed in some dictionaries, yet it’s not standard. The standard word that fits is “POSIT” but that ends in T. 

Hold on—let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with POS and ending with E:
- POSSE (already tried, S in 4 is invalid)
- POISE (ends with E, but I is unused and fits: P O I S E)

Let’s check POISE:
- P(✓) O(✓) I(new) S(?) E(✓)

From previous feedback:
- S must be in the word (from AROSE and SPOKE), and in POISE S is in position 4. 
- The feedback on S in position 4 from AROSE was (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. So S cannot be in 4. 

Thus POISE is invalid because S would be in position 4. 

Next candidate: POSLE (a type of fish), but L hasn’t been tested and it’s obscure.

Next: POSNE (invalid). 

Next: POSPE (invalid). 

Next: POSSE (invalid, S in 4). 

Next: POSVE (invalid). 

Next: POSYE (invalid). 

Next: POSZE (invalid). 

The only remaining valid word that starts with POS and ends with E, uses S not in position 4, is “POSEE” which is invalid. 

Wait—let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback shows:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) means S is in position 3.
- So the word is P O S _ E.

We need a letter in position 4 that is not S and hasn’t been ruled out. From previous guesses, used letters: A, R, K, H. 

Possible unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, L, M, N, T.

Looking for POS _ E:
- POSBE (invalid)
- POSCE (invalid)
- POSDE (invalid)
- POSFE (invalid)
- POSGE (invalid)
- POSIE (invalid)
- POSLE (valid, but rare)
- POSME (invalid)
