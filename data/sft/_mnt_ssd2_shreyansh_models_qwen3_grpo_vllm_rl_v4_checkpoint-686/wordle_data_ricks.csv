### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

From the new feedback on TRIPS:
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, S (with S locked at position 5).
- Letters confirmed **not** in the word: A, O, E, T, P.
- Letters in the word but not yet placed: I (not in position 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (because S is in position 5).
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 3 from previous guesses—wait, in TRIPS it was marked “-” at position 3, so R can’t be in position 3 either. So R must be in position 1 or 4).
3. Contains I somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but position 5 is S, so 1, 2, or 3).
4. Uses only remaining possible letters (no A, O, E, T, P).

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: could be R or I or another consonant
- Position 2: could be I or another consonant
- Position 3: could be I or R (but R can’t be here because in TRIPS it was position 3 and marked “-”, so R must be in position 1 or 4)
Wait, in TRIPS R was position 3 and marked “-”, so R cannot be in position 3. Therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try R in position 1 and I in position 2:
Word pattern: R I _ _ S
We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that are not A, O, E, T, P, and ideally are common. Good candidates: N, D, L, C, M, etc.

A common word fitting this: R I N G S → RINGS
Check letters: R, I, N, G, S – none are forbidden. R is in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, G in 4, S in 5. This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R can be here)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in TRIPS, so 2 is ok)
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- No A, O, E, T, P are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, E.
- Letters definitely present: R, S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R and S in different positions than before.
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Introduces other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.) to gather more information.

A good candidate is “TRIPS”:
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to position 3.
- S moves from position 4 to position 5.
- No A, O, E are used.

This should give us useful information about T, I, P and confirm the correct placement of R and S.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TRIPS:
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is still in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it wasn’t in position 2).
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 4.
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word **and** in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, S (with S locked at position 5).
- Letters confirmed **not** in the word: A, O, E, T, P.
- Letters in the word but not yet placed: I (not in position 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (because S is in position 5).
2. Contains R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 3 from previous guesses—wait, in TRIPS it was marked “-” at position 3, so R can’t be in position 3 either. So R must be in position 1 or 4).
3. Contains I somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but position 5 is S, so 1, 2, or 3).
4. Uses only remaining possible letters (no A, O, E, T, P).

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Position 1: could be R or I or another consonant
- Position 2: could be I or another consonant
- Position 3: could be I or R (but R can’t be here because in TRIPS it was position 3 and marked “-”, so R must be in position 1 or 4)
Wait, in TRIPS R was position 3 and marked “-”, so R cannot be in position 3. Therefore R must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s try R in position 1 and I in position 2:
Word pattern: R I _ _ S
We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) that are not A, O, E, T, P, and ideally are common. Good candidates: N, D, L, C, M, etc.

A common word fitting this: R I N G S → RINGS
Check letters: R, I, N, G, S – none are forbidden. R is in position 1, I in 2, N in 3, G in 4, S in 5. This seems valid.

Let me verify:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R can be here)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I was marked “-” in position 4 in TRIPS, so 2 is ok)
- S is in position 5 (matches ✓)
- No A, O, E, T, P are used.

This should give us good information.

- R(✓) – position 1 correct
- I(✓) – position 2 correct
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word
- K(✓) – position 4 correct
- S(✓) – position 5 correct

So the word is now fully determined except for position 3:
R I _ K S

Letters ruled out so far: A, O, E, T, P, N, G, L.

We need a single letter for position 3 that is not in the ruled-out set. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, H, M, V, W, Y.

Looking for 5-letter words matching R I _ K S:
- R I B K S – no common word
- R I C K S – ""RICKS"" (valid variant of ""rucks"" or surname)
- R I D K S – no common word
- R I F K S – no common word
- R I H K S – no common word
- R I M K S – no common word
- R I V K S – no common word
- R I W K S – no common word
- R I Y K S – no common word

The only plausible candidate is ""RICKS"".

Let's verify:
- R I C K S
- C is not in any previous ruled-out list.
- Forms a valid word (though rare, ""ricks"" is a plural noun).

Since every other letter is already fixed, this must be the word.",Guess 5: RICKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) C(✓) K(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
