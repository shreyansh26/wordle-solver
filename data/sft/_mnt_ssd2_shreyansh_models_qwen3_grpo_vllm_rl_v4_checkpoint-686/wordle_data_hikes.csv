### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 unique letters

This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most common letters in one guess, which will provide good information about what letters are in the secret word and their positions.

- Uses S and E (confirmed letters).
- Adds T, I, N (new letters).
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Positions S at 1 and E at 3 (different from previous positions, testing new placements).

This should give useful information about T, I, N and help lock down the positions of S and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): S, E, I  

Specific positional information:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the word must contain S, E, I exactly once each, and the remaining two letters must be chosen from the still-unused alphabet (excluding A, R, O, T, N).  
Good remaining consonants to test: L, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides E and I).

Let’s try to place S, E, I in new positions and fill the remaining two slots with fresh letters.  
A candidate word that satisfies these constraints: “SPIKE”.

Check:
- S is in position 1 → but feedback says S is NOT in position 1 (from STEIN). So SPIKE is invalid.

Next candidate: “SIEVE”  
- S in position 1 → invalid (same issue).

Next: “LIES” is only 4 letters.

Next: “SLEEP”

Next: “SIEPS” – invalid (repeats S, and P,S positions still unknown).

Next: “SIEVE” – rejected.

We need 5 letters, containing S, E, I, and two new letters from the remaining pool.  
Possible new letters: L, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

Try “S, I, E” in positions 2, 3, 4:  
- _ I S E _ → need two new letters.  
Candidate: “CHISE” – but C,H,I,S,E: H is new, C is new.  
“CHISE” is a valid English word (archaic for “chide”), but may be obscure.

Another candidate: “DISKS” – contains S twice, invalid.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters

- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

- S is not in the 4th position (so it could be 1,2,3, or 5).
- E is not in the 5th position (so it could be 1,2,3, or 4).

Next guess should:

2. Avoid A, R, O.
3. Try new consonants and vowels to narrow down remaining letters.

A good candidate is “STEIN”:
- Uses S and E (confirmed letters).
- Adds T, I, N (new letters).
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Positions S at 1 and E at 3 (different from previous positions, testing new placements).

Let’s systematically construct a valid word:
We need 5 letters, containing S, E, I, and two new letters from the remaining pool.  
Possible new letters: L, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

Try “S, I, E” in positions 2, 3, 4:  
- _ I S E _ → need two new letters.  
Candidate: “CHISE” – but C,H,I,S,E: H is new, C is new.  
“CHISE” is a valid English word (archaic for “chide”), but may be obscure.

Another candidate: “DISKS” – contains S twice, invalid.

Another: “FISTS” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “PISES” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “BISSE” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “MISSE” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “LISPS” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “DISES” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “GISES” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “KISSE” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “WISPS” – S twice, invalid.

Another: “HIDES” – contains H, D, and has I, E, S.  
Check positions:  
H I D E S  
- S is in position 5 → allowed (feedback only ruled out 1 and 4).  
- E is in position 4 → allowed (feedback ruled out 3 and 5).  
- I is in position 2 → allowed (feedback ruled out 4).  
All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, “HIDES” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct positions:
  – H is in position 1 (✓)
  – I is in position 2 (✓)
  – E is in position 4 (✓)
  – S is in position 5 (✓)

- Letters known NOT to be in the word:
  A, R, O, T, N, D

- Therefore the word must be of the form:
  H I _ E S

The only remaining letter to determine is the third character (position 3).  
Allowed letters (not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit H I _ E S:
- H I K E S  → “HIKES” (valid word, “to hike”)
- H I L E S  → “HILES” (rare, plural of “hile” – a type of shrub)
- H I M E S  → “HIMES” (rare, variant spelling of “hymes”)
- H I P E S  → “HIPES” (rare, plural of “hype”)
- H I V E S  → “HIVES” (valid word)

Among these, “HIKES” is the most common English word.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “HIKES”.
