For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains the vowels A, O, E and the consonants R, S. This combination covers many common letters and will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - also covering common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter distribution for initial testing.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: A, I, U, (O already used)

Let me try to place A and O in new positions and pick other common consonants. A good candidate is ""PLAID"" but it has an I and D, but let me think of something simpler.

""ADOPT"" has A and O but uses P, T which are common.
But O is in position 3 in ADOPT, which is invalid since O can't be in position 3.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but O is in position 2 which is fine, A is in position 5 which is fine.

Another option: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded.
""COBRA"" - R is excluded.
""COALA"" - L is fine, A is in position 4, O in position 2.

I think ""COALA"" is a good next guess, but let me check if there's a better word.

""COBIA"" seems valid - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

Alternatively, ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded.

""COALA"" seems good, but let me think of ""PLAID"" - but D is fine, but I is fine.

Wait, ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 which is allowed since A is not restricted from position 3, only O is restricted from position 3.

""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D. Contains A (position 3), no R, S, E. This seems good.

But let me pick a word that uses O as well since we know O is in the word. So ""PLAID"" might not be optimal as it doesn't use O.

Better to use a word with O in a new position. ""COBIA"" uses O in position 2, which is fine.

But ""COBIA"" is a type of fish - might not be the best choice.

""COALA"" is also a type of animal.

""COBIA"" is actually a valid word.

Alternatively, ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" are both good, but ""COBIA"" is more common.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1 (it's in 5), O not in position 3 (it's in 2).

This seems valid.

But to make it more common, perhaps ""COBIA"" is too niche.

Another option: ""COBIA"" is actually a good choice as it's a valid word.

   - C, B, I are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- The word has A, but A is not in position 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain: R, S, E, C, B, I.

Letters left to try: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must appear in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is O).

Possible patterns:
- _ O A _ _
- _ O _ A _

Let's try to fill these patterns with remaining letters. Good consonants to try are D, L, N, T, etc.

A possible word: DOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed)
But let's check:
- D, O, U, G, H
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is not in this word, so this is invalid.

We need A in position 3 or 4.

Let's try: FOAMY (but M is allowed, Y is allowed)
F, O, A, M, Y
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters: F, O, A, M, Y - none of R, S, E, C, B, I are present.

This seems valid.

Another option: GOAL? but we need 5 letters.

FOAMY seems good - F, O, A, M, Y. All letters are allowed.

Let's go with FOAMY.

So far we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- The word has A, but A is not in position 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain: R, S, E, C, B, I.

Letters left to try: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must appear in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is O).

Possible patterns:
- _ O A _ _
- _ O _ A _

Let's try to fill these patterns with remaining letters. Good consonants to try are D, L, N, T, etc.

A possible word: DOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed)
But let's check:
- D, O, U, G, H
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is not in this word, so this is invalid.

We need A in position 3 or 4.

Let's try: FOAMY (but M is allowed, Y is allowed)
F, O, A, M, Y
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters: F, O, A, M, Y - none of R, S, E, C, B, I are present.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains the vowels A, O, E and the consonants R, S. This combination covers many common letters and will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - also covering common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter distribution for initial testing.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: A, I, U, (O already used)

Let me try to place A and O in new positions and pick other common consonants. A good candidate is ""PLAID"" but it has an I and D, but let me think of something simpler.

""ADOPT"" has A and O but uses P, T which are common.
But O is in position 3 in ADOPT, which is invalid since O can't be in position 3.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but O is in position 2 which is fine, A is in position 5 which is fine.

Another option: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded.
""COBRA"" - R is excluded.
""COALA"" - L is fine, A is in position 4, O in position 2.

I think ""COALA"" is a good next guess, but let me check if there's a better word.

""COBIA"" seems valid - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

Alternatively, ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded.

""COALA"" seems good, but let me think of ""PLAID"" - but D is fine, but I is fine.

Wait, ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 which is allowed since A is not restricted from position 3, only O is restricted from position 3.

""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D. Contains A (position 3), no R, S, E. This seems good.

But let me pick a word that uses O as well since we know O is in the word. So ""PLAID"" might not be optimal as it doesn't use O.

Better to use a word with O in a new position. ""COBIA"" uses O in position 2, which is fine.

But ""COBIA"" is a type of fish - might not be the best choice.

""COALA"" is also a type of animal.

""COBIA"" is actually a valid word.

Alternatively, ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" are both good, but ""COBIA"" is more common.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1 (it's in 5), O not in position 3 (it's in 2).

This seems valid.

But to make it more common, perhaps ""COBIA"" is too niche.

Another option: ""COBIA"" is actually a good choice as it's a valid word.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" as both are valid.

I'll go with ""COBIA"" as it's a valid 5-letter word and uses O in position 2 and A in position 5, with no R, S, E.Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that repositions A and O and uses new consonants.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: A, I, U, (O already used)

Let me try to place A and O in new positions and pick other common consonants. A good candidate is ""PLAID"" but it has an I and D, but let me think of something simpler.

""ADOPT"" has A and O but uses P, T which are common.
But O is in position 3 in ADOPT, which is invalid since O can't be in position 3.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but O is in position 2 which is fine, A is in position 5 which is fine.

Another option: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded.
""COBRA"" - R is excluded.
""COALA"" - L is fine, A is in position 4, O in position 2.

I think ""COALA"" is a good next guess, but let me check if there's a better word.

""COBIA"" seems valid - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

Alternatively, ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded.

""COALA"" seems good, but let me think of ""PLAID"" - but D is fine, but I is fine.

Wait, ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 which is allowed since A is not restricted from position 3, only O is restricted from position 3.

""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D. Contains A (position 3), no R, S, E. This seems good.

But let me pick a word that uses O as well since we know O is in the word. So ""PLAID"" might not be optimal as it doesn't use O.

Better to use a word with O in a new position. ""COBIA"" uses O in position 2, which is fine.

But ""COBIA"" is a type of fish - might not be the best choice.

""COALA"" is also a type of animal.

""COBIA"" is actually a valid word.

Alternatively, ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" are both good, but ""COBIA"" is more common.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1 (it's in 5), O not in position 3 (it's in 2).

This seems valid.

But to make it more common, perhaps ""COBIA"" is too niche.

Another option: ""COBIA"" is actually a good choice as it's a valid word.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" as both are valid.

I'll go with ""COBIA"" as it's a valid 5-letter word and uses O in position 2 and A in position 5, with no R, S, E.Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that repositions A and O and uses new consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. COBIA → C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C, B, I are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- The word has A, but A is not in position 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain: R, S, E, C, B, I.

Letters left to try: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must appear in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is O).

Possible patterns:
- _ O A _ _
- _ O _ A _

Let's try to fill these patterns with remaining letters. Good consonants to try are D, L, N, T, etc.

A possible word: DOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed)
But let's check:
- D, O, U, G, H
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is not in this word, so this is invalid.

We need A in position 3 or 4.

Let's try: FOAMY (but M is allowed, Y is allowed)
F, O, A, M, Y
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters: F, O, A, M, Y - none of R, S, E, C, B, I are present.

This seems valid.

Another option: GOAL? but we need 5 letters.

FOAMY seems good - F, O, A, M, Y. All letters are allowed.

Let's go with FOAMY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
Guess 3: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) A(✓) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. COBIA → C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C, B, I are NOT in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word, but not in position 5.

3. FOAMY → F(x) O(✓) A(✓) M(x) Y(x)
   - F, M, Y are NOT in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – confirmed.
   - A is in position 3 (✓) – now locked in.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Positions 1, 4, 5: to be determined from remaining letters.

Letters known NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, B, I, F, M, Y.

Remaining candidate letters: D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three more letters for positions 1, 4, 5. Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting the pattern _ O A _ _ with the allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- D, O, A, L, T → DOALT (not a word)
- D, O, A, N, T → DOANT (not a word)
- D, O, A, T, S → but S is excluded
- G, O, A, L, T → GOALT (not a word)
- H, O, A, L, T → HOALT (not a word)
- J, O, A, L, T → JOALT (not a word)
- K, O, A, L, T → KOALT (not a word)
- L, O, A, D, S → S excluded
- N, O, A, D, S → S excluded
- P, O, A, L, T → POALT (not a word)
- T, O, A, L, D → TOALD (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Maybe position 4 or 5 can be different.

Let me think of actual English words with the pattern _ O A _ _ using allowed letters.

- GOAL? needs 5 letters.
- HOAGY (Y excluded)
- HOARD (R, D allowed – R is excluded)
- HOPAL (not a word)
- JOKAL (not a word)
- KNOT? no
- DOT? no
- POTAL (not a word)
- TOTAL (T allowed, but R excluded)

Wait, let me systematically list valid English words with pattern _ O A _ _:

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ O A _ _:
- COAST (C, S excluded)
- GOATS (S, T allowed – but S excluded)
- HOAGY (Y excluded)
- JOKER (R excluded)
- KNOBS (S excluded)
- LODES (S excluded)
- MOANS (S excluded)
- NOADS (S excluded)
- POACH (H allowed, C excluded)
- TOADS (S excluded)
- VODKA (K allowed, but V, D allowed)
- WODGE (G allowed, but E excluded)
- XENO? no
- ZONAL (L allowed)

From these, the only viable candidate seems ""VODKA"":
- V, O, D, K, A
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- Letters: V, D, K are not excluded (not in the forbidden list: R, S, E, C, B, I, F, M, Y)
- This is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me double-check:
- V: allowed
- O: allowed (in position 2)
- D: allowed
- K: allowed
- A: allowed (in position 3)

No conflicts. So VODKA is a valid guess.

- HOTAL (not a word)
- JOTAL (not a word)
- NODAL (N, O, D, A, L) — D is allowed in position 4? No, D is not allowed in position 4 (from VODKA feedback). So NODAL is invalid because D would be in position 4.
- POTAL (not a word)
- ZONTAL (too long)

Only valid candidate is DOTAL:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains the vowels A, O, E and the consonants R, S. This combination covers many common letters and will help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - also covering common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has slightly better letter distribution for initial testing.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: A, O
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does NOT contain R, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and O not in position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: A, I, U, (O already used)

Let me try to place A and O in new positions and pick other common consonants. A good candidate is ""PLAID"" but it has an I and D, but let me think of something simpler.

""ADOPT"" has A and O but uses P, T which are common.
But O is in position 3 in ADOPT, which is invalid since O can't be in position 3.

""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A - but O is in position 2 which is fine, A is in position 5 which is fine.

Another option: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded.
""COBRA"" - R is excluded.
""COALA"" - L is fine, A is in position 4, O in position 2.

I think ""COALA"" is a good next guess, but let me check if there's a better word.

""COBIA"" seems valid - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

Alternatively, ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded.

""COALA"" seems good, but let me think of ""PLAID"" - but D is fine, but I is fine.

Wait, ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 which is allowed since A is not restricted from position 3, only O is restricted from position 3.

""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D. Contains A (position 3), no R, S, E. This seems good.

But let me pick a word that uses O as well since we know O is in the word. So ""PLAID"" might not be optimal as it doesn't use O.

Better to use a word with O in a new position. ""COBIA"" uses O in position 2, which is fine.

But ""COBIA"" is a type of fish - might not be the best choice.

""COALA"" is also a type of animal.

""COBIA"" is actually a valid word.

Alternatively, ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" are both good, but ""COBIA"" is more common.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A. No R, S, E. A not in position 1 (it's in 5), O not in position 3 (it's in 2).

This seems valid.

But to make it more common, perhaps ""COBIA"" is too niche.

Another option: ""COBIA"" is actually a good choice as it's a valid word.

But let me think of ""COBIA"" or ""COALA"" as both are valid.

I'll go with ""COBIA"" as it's a valid 5-letter word and uses O in position 2 and A in position 5, with no R, S, E.Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but in wrong positions, and R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that repositions A and O and uses new consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. COBIA → C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C, B, I are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word, but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- The word has A, but A is not in position 1 or 5.
- The word does NOT contain: R, S, E, C, B, I.

Letters left to try: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must appear in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1 or 5, and 2 is O).

Possible patterns:
- _ O A _ _
- _ O _ A _

Let's try to fill these patterns with remaining letters. Good consonants to try are D, L, N, T, etc.

A possible word: DOUGH (but G is allowed, H is allowed, U is allowed)
But let's check:
- D, O, U, G, H
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is not in this word, so this is invalid.

We need A in position 3 or 4.

Let's try: FOAMY (but M is allowed, Y is allowed)
F, O, A, M, Y
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed)
- Letters: F, O, A, M, Y - none of R, S, E, C, B, I are present.

This seems valid.

Another option: GOAL? but we need 5 letters.

FOAMY seems good - F, O, A, M, Y. All letters are allowed.

Let's go with FOAMY.

Guess 3: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) A(✓) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. COBIA → C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - C, B, I are NOT in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word, but not in position 5.

3. FOAMY → F(x) O(✓) A(✓) M(x) Y(x)
   - F, M, Y are NOT in the word.
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – confirmed.
   - A is in position 3 (✓) – now locked in.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Positions 1, 4, 5: to be determined from remaining letters.

Letters known NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, B, I, F, M, Y.

Remaining candidate letters: D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need three more letters for positions 1, 4, 5. Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting the pattern _ O A _ _ with the allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- D, O, A, L, T → DOALT (not a word)
- D, O, A, N, T → DOANT (not a word)
- D, O, A, T, S → but S is excluded
- G, O, A, L, T → GOALT (not a word)
- H, O, A, L, T → HOALT (not a word)
- J, O, A, L, T → JOALT (not a word)
- K, O, A, L, T → KOALT (not a word)
- L, O, A, D, S → S excluded
- N, O, A, D, S → S excluded
- P, O, A, L, T → POALT (not a word)
- T, O, A, L, D → TOALD (not a word)

Hmm, none of these are valid English words. Maybe position 4 or 5 can be different.

Let me think of actual English words with the pattern _ O A _ _ using allowed letters.

- GOAL? needs 5 letters.
- HOAGY (Y excluded)
- HOARD (R, D allowed – R is excluded)
- HOPAL (not a word)
- JOKAL (not a word)
- KNOT? no
- DOT? no
- POTAL (not a word)
- TOTAL (T allowed, but R excluded)

Wait, let me systematically list valid English words with pattern _ O A _ _:

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ O A _ _:
- COAST (C, S excluded)
- GOATS (S, T allowed – but S excluded)
- HOAGY (Y excluded)
- JOKER (R excluded)
- KNOBS (S excluded)
- LODES (S excluded)
- MOANS (S excluded)
- NOADS (S excluded)
- POACH (H allowed, C excluded)
- TOADS (S excluded)
- VODKA (K allowed, but V, D allowed)
- WODGE (G allowed, but E excluded)
- XENO? no
- ZONAL (L allowed)

From these, the only viable candidate seems ""VODKA"":
- V, O, D, K, A
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- Letters: V, D, K are not excluded (not in the forbidden list: R, S, E, C, B, I, F, M, Y)
- This is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me double-check:
- V: allowed
- O: allowed (in position 2)
- D: allowed
- K: allowed
- A: allowed (in position 3)

No conflicts. So VODKA is a valid guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5.
   - O is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. COBIA → C(x) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(-)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) — now fixed.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

3. FOAMY → F(x) O(✓) A(✓) M(x) Y(x)
   - A is now locked in position 3.

4. VODKA → V(x) O(✓) D(-) K(x) A(-)
   - O is still in position 2 (✓).
   - A is still in position 3 (✓).
   - D is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: not D
- Position 1: ?
- Position 5: ?

Letters known NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, B, I, F, M, Y, V, K.

Remaining candidate letters: G, H, J, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5, with D allowed in position 1 or 5 (since D is in the word but not in position 4).

Possible words fitting _ O A _ _ with allowed letters:

- GOAL? needs 5 letters.
- HOAGY (Y excluded)

- ZONAL (L allowed, but Z, N, A, L — A is in position 3)
- TOTAL (R excluded)
- DOTAL (D in position 1, T, O, A, L — but L is allowed, T is allowed)

Wait, let me list valid English words with pattern _ O A _ _ using remaining letters:

Valid words:
- DOTAL (D, O, T, A, L) — D is allowed in position 1, T and L are allowed.
- HOTAL (not a word)
- JOTAL (not a word)
- NODAL (N, O, D, A, L) — D is allowed in position 4? No, D is not allowed in position 4 (from VODKA feedback). So NODAL is invalid because D would be in position 4.

- ZONTAL (too long)

Only valid candidate is DOTAL:
- D in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (✓)

From all feedback:

- Positions 2 and 3 are locked: O(2) A(3)
- D is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from VODKA and DOTAL)
- T is NOT in the word (from DOTAL)
- L is NOT in the word (from DOTAL)
- Letters already excluded: R,S,E,C,B,I,F,M,Y,V,K,T,L
- Remaining candidate letters: G, H, J, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

D must appear in the word but has been ruled out of positions 1,4,5. The only remaining position is position 4. But from VODKA, D is not in position 4. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that D is in the word must be re-examined.

Wait, let's carefully re-express the feedback:

From VODKA: V(x) O(✓) D(-) K(x) A(-)
- D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From DOTAL: D(-) O(✓) T(x) A(-) L(-)
- D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So D is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4. In a 5-letter word with O in 2 and A in 3, the remaining positions for D are 5 (since 4 is excluded and 1 is excluded).

Thus the pattern must be: _ O A _ D

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with allowed letters. Allowed letters (not excluded): G, H, J, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting: ? O A ? D

Possible words:
- GOAD? needs 5 letters
- HOAGY (Y excluded)
- JOAD? (not a word)
- NOAD? (not a word)
- POAD? (not a word)
- WOAD? (valid: W, O, A, D)

Looking up, ""WOAD"" is a valid 5-letter word (an old term for a plant). But let's check:
- W: allowed
- O: allowed (position 2)
- A: allowed (position 3)
- D: allowed (position 5, which is allowed since D cannot be in 1 or 4)
- All letters are from the allowed set.

Thus WOAD is a valid guess.
