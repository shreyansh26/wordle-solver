For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: very common ending letter
- E: most common letter overall

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S but not in the 1st position.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 1).
2. Does not contain L, A, T, E.

Good consonants left to try: R, N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be a word that tests several new common letters while placing S in a different position. ""SHORN"" is a good candidate:
- S in position 1 is invalid (from SLATE), but ""SHORN"" has S in position 1 – so this is bad.
""SPURN"" – S in position 1 again – bad.
""CRISP"" – S in position 4, and tests C, R, I, P.
But ""CRISP"" has S in position 4, which is allowed.

Another good option: ""DROSS"" – S in position 4 and 5, but repeats S.
""SHINS"" – S in position 1 and 5 – bad.
""SPINS"" – S in 1 and 5 – bad.

""CRISP"" seems best: C, R, I, S, P – all new letters, S in position 4.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   – S exists but is not in position 1.
   – L, A, T, E are absent.

2. CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) P(x)
   – S exists but is not in position 4.
   – C, R, I, P are absent.

3. BONGS → B(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(-) S(✓)
   – B is absent.
   – O is in position 2 and is correct.
   – N is in position 3 and is correct.
   – G exists but is not in position 4.
   – S is in position 5 and is correct.

So the current partial word is:
_ O N _ S

Letters still allowed (have not been ruled out):
D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus G (which must appear somewhere except position 4).

We know G must be in the word (from BONGS feedback), and the only remaining positions are 1 and 4. Position 4 is currently empty ( _ N _ S ), so G could be in position 4. That would give us:
_ O N G S

But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only common word that fits this pattern is ""WONGS"", but W has not been ruled out yet. However, ""WONGS"" is a valid word (a variant spelling of ""wongs"" as a suffix), but it's obscure. 

Another possibility is ""HONGS"" – but H hasn't been ruled out. 

But looking at the remaining letters, the most straightforward word that fits _ O N _ S with G in position 4 is ""WONGS"". However, ""WONGS"" is not in common dictionaries. 

Wait, let's think differently: G could be in position 1 instead. That would give us:
G O N _ S

But then we need a letter for position 4. From remaining letters, possible choices are D, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z. 

Looking for valid words:
- GONDS – not a word
- GONFS – not a word
- GONHS – not a word
- GONKS – not a word
- GONMS – not a word
- GONUS – not a word
- GONVS – not a word
- GONWS – not a word
- GONYs – not a word
- GONZs – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider. The word must be _ O N _ S with G somewhere except position 4. The only remaining position for G is 1, but then we have G O N _ S, and there's no valid word. 

Wait, perhaps G is not in position 4 but in position 1. Then the word is G O N _ S. The only valid word here is ""GONIS"" – but I is already ruled out. 

This suggests that G must indeed be in position 4, making the word _ O N G S. The only valid word fitting this is ""WONGS"", but it's obscure. 

However, looking back at the allowed letters, ""D"" is still allowed. So ""DONGS"" – but that's not a word. 

I think the correct word must be ""WONGS"", even if it's less common. Alternatively, perhaps ""GONGS"" – but G would be in position 1 and 4, and position 4 is already taken by G in BONGS feedback. 

Wait, in BONGS, G is in position 4 and marked (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore G must be in position 1. So the word is:
G O N _ S

Now we need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed letters: D, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z. 

Looking for valid words:
- GONDS – no
- GONFS – no
- GONHS – no
- GONKS – no
- GONMS – no
- GONUS – no
- GONVS – no
- GONWS – no
- GONYs – no
- GONZs – no

This seems impossible. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

BONGS → B(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(-) S(✓)
- G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4. So G must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 2 and 3 are already taken by O and N. Therefore G must be in position 1. 

So the word is:
G O N _ S

Now, the only remaining letter to determine is position 4. From allowed letters (D, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z), and needing a valid word, the only possible word is ""GONIS"" – but I is ruled out. 

This suggests that the word must be ""GONGS"", but that would have G in position 1 and 4, and position 4 is already marked as not G. 

I think the correct word must be ""GONDS"" – but that's not a word. 

Wait, perhaps I missed ""HONGS"" – but H hasn't been ruled out. 

Let me check: H is still allowed. So ""HONGS"" – but this is a valid word (a type of fish). 

But why wasn't H ruled out? Because H hasn't appeared in any guess yet. 

So ""HONGS"" fits:
- H (position 1) – allowed
- O (position 2) – correct
- N (position 3) – correct
- G (position 4) – but G(-) from BONGS means G is not in position 4. So this is invalid. 

Thus G must be in position 1, making the word:
G O N _ S

The only remaining letter for position 4 must be from allowed letters. The only valid word here is ""GONIS"" – but I is ruled out. 

This seems like a contradiction. Perhaps the word is ""GONDS"" – but it's not a word. 

I think the correct word must be ""WONGS"", even if it's less common. 

But looking at the feedback again, let's list all constraints:
- Positions: _ O N _ S
- Must contain G (not in position 4)
- Must not contain: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, B
- G must be in position 1, making G O N _ S
- Position 4 must be a letter not yet ruled out: D, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z
- The only valid word here is ""GONDS"" – but it's not a word. 

This suggests I might have missed a word. Let me think of all possible words fitting G O N _ S:
- GONAD – but A is ruled out
- GONER – but E and R are ruled out
- GONER – R is ruled out
- GONIF – I is ruled out
- GONIS – I is ruled out
- GONJO – O is in position 2
- GONKS – K is allowed, but is ""GONKS"" a word? It means to hit hard, but it's valid.
- GONKS – G O N K S

Checking letters:
- G – allowed
- O – correct position
- N – correct position
- K – not yet ruled out
- S – correct position

This seems valid. 

Another possibility is ""GONMS"" – but that's not a word. 

Thus, the most likely word is ""GONKS"".

But let me verify: GONKS is a valid word (slang for ""gonk"" + ""s""). 

Therefore, the correct guess is ""GONKS"".

Based on the feedback:
- O and N are correctly placed in positions 2 and 3.
- S is correctly placed in position 5.
- G must be present but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1.
- Remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set.
