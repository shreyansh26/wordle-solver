For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - includes multiple vowels

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five new, common letters that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced starter that avoids S, L, A, T, E and uses common letters is “CRONY”.  
It contains C, R, O, N, Y — all still possible and covers two new vowels plus three common consonants.

Another solid choice would be “BRICK” or “CHORD”, but “CRONY” feels slightly more neutral.

I’ll go with “CRONY”.

Let’s look for valid words:

However, we already know N is not in position 4 (from BUNNY feedback), but here N appears in positions 1,3,4,5 – but position 5 is Y, so positions 1,3,4 have N. But we only know N is not in position 4 (from BUNNY’s 4th N got “-”), so N in position 1 is okay, but N in position 3 or 4 would conflict. So NINNY is invalid because N appears in position 3 and 4.

- _ N _ _ Y:  
  DINGY – but I and G are allowed, but D is allowed. However, N is in position 2, which is okay. But DINGY uses I and G which are allowed. Wait, but DINGY has N in position 2, which is allowed. But let me check: D, I, N, G, Y – all allowed letters, and N is in position 2. This seems valid.

But let me check if there are better options. Another word:  
FINNY – F, I, N, N, Y – again N appears in positions 3 and 4, which may be invalid.

HUNKY – H, U, N, K, Y – but U is excluded.

PINGY – P, I, N, G, Y – N in position 3, which may be invalid.

DINGY seems to be the only valid word left that fits:
- Ends with Y.
- N in position 2 (which is allowed).
- All letters allowed.

Let me confirm DINGY: D, I, N, G, Y – none are in the excluded list, and N is in position 2, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus, the next guess is DINGY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - includes multiple vowels

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five new, common letters that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced starter that avoids S, L, A, T, E and uses common letters is “CRONY”.  
It contains C, R, O, N, Y — all still possible and covers two new vowels plus three common consonants.

Another solid choice would be “BRICK” or “CHORD”, but “CRONY” feels slightly more neutral.

I’ll go with “CRONY”.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Letters that ARE in the word: Y (and it is in the 5th position)
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.

That leaves the following available letters (alphabet minus the excluded ones):
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains N somewhere other than the 4th position.
3. Uses only the available letters.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ _ N Y: e.g., BINGY, DINGY, FINGY, HINGY, etc.
- _ _ N _ Y: e.g., BUNNY, DUNNY, FUNKY, etc.
- _ N _ _ Y: e.g., BINGOY (invalid length), DINGOY (invalid), FUNKY (ends Y), etc.

Valid words:
- BINGY (B, I, N, G, Y) – all letters allowed, N in 3rd position.
- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – same.
- FUNKY (F, U, N, K, Y) – N in 3rd.
- HUNKY (H, U, N, K, Y) – N in 3rd.
- BUNNY (B, U, N, N, Y) – N in 3rd and 4th, but 4th N is allowed since we only know N is not in 4th position in CRONY, not globally.

""BUNNY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains N (in positions 3 and 4).
- No excluded letters.

Let’s go with BUNNY.

Available letters (excluding the banned set): F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two consonants from that list to fill positions 3 and 4.  
Looking for real 5-letter words fitting N I _ _ Y:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - includes multiple vowels

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means the word must be built entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five new, common letters that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good consonants left: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A balanced starter that avoids S, L, A, T, E and uses common letters is “CRONY”.  
It contains C, R, O, N, Y — all still possible and covers two new vowels plus three common consonants.

Another solid choice would be “BRICK” or “CHORD”, but “CRONY” feels slightly more neutral.

I’ll go with “CRONY”.

So far we know:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Letters that ARE in the word: Y (and it is in the 5th position)
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.

That leaves the following available letters (alphabet minus the excluded ones):
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains N somewhere other than the 4th position.
3. Uses only the available letters.

Possible positions for N: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ _ N Y: e.g., BINGY, DINGY, FINGY, HINGY, etc.
- _ _ N _ Y: e.g., BUNNY, DUNNY, FUNKY, etc.
- _ N _ _ Y: e.g., BINGOY (invalid length), DINGOY (invalid), FUNKY (ends Y), etc.

Valid words:
- BINGY (B, I, N, G, Y) – all letters allowed, N in 3rd position.
- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – same.
- FUNKY (F, U, N, K, Y) – N in 3rd.
- HUNKY (H, U, N, K, Y) – N in 3rd.
- BUNNY (B, U, N, N, Y) – N in 3rd and 4th, but 4th N is allowed since we only know N is not in 4th position in CRONY, not globally.

""BUNNY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains N (in positions 3 and 4).
- No excluded letters.

Let’s go with BUNNY.

Current information:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, B, U

Letters known TO be in the word:  
Y (fixed in position 5)

Letter N is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in BUNNY both N’s got “-” feedback).

So N must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
But position 5 is already Y, so N must be in position 1 or 2.

Available letters (all others except the excluded ones):  
D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.
- Has N in position 1 or 2.
- Uses only the available letters.

Possible patterns:  
N _ _ _ Y  or  _ N _ _ Y

Let’s look for valid words:

- N _ _ _ Y:  
  NINNY (but I is allowed, N is allowed, Y is fixed) – but “NINNY” is 5 letters and fits: N I N N Y. However, we already know N is not in position 4 (from BUNNY feedback), but here N appears in positions 1,3,4,5 – but position 5 is Y, so positions 1,3,4 have N. But we only know N is not in position 4 (from BUNNY’s 4th N got “-”), so N in position 1 is okay, but N in position 3 or 4 would conflict. So NINNY is invalid because N appears in position 3 and 4.

- _ N _ _ Y:  
  DINGY – but I and G are allowed, but D is allowed. However, N is in position 2, which is okay. But DINGY uses I and G which are allowed. Wait, but DINGY has N in position 2, which is allowed. But let me check: D, I, N, G, Y – all allowed letters, and N is in position 2. This seems valid.

But let me check if there are better options. Another word:  
FINNY – F, I, N, N, Y – again N appears in positions 3 and 4, which may be invalid.

HUNKY – H, U, N, K, Y – but U is excluded.

PINGY – P, I, N, G, Y – N in position 3, which may be invalid.

DINGY seems to be the only valid word left that fits:
- Ends with Y.
- N in position 2 (which is allowed).
- All letters allowed.

Let me confirm DINGY: D, I, N, G, Y – none are in the excluded list, and N is in position 2, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Thus, the next guess is DINGY.

Letter N is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4 (from BUNNY and DINGY).

From the latest feedback:

- N is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- I is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- Y is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- M and B are NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern is: N I _ _ Y

Available letters (excluding all previously excluded letters and M, B):
F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4. Let's look for valid 5-letter words fitting N I _ _ Y:

- N I F _ Y → NIFFY (valid)
- N I K _ Y → NIKKY (valid)
- N I P _ Y → NIPPY (invalid)
- N I V _ Y → NIVDY (invalid)
- N I H _ Y → N IH _ Y → N I H A Y (invalid)
- N I H O Y (invalid)
- N I H U Y (invalid)
- N I H E Y (invalid)
- N I H A Y (invalid)
- N I H A Y (invalid)

The valid words are NIFFY and NIKKY. Between these, NIFFY is more common.

But let me double-check NIFFY: N, I, F, F, Y - all letters are allowed and fit the pattern. NIKKY uses K and Y, but Y is already in position 5, so NIKKY is N I K K Y, which also fits. However, NIFFY is more likely.

But wait, the pattern is N I _ _ Y, so NIKKY would be N I K K Y, which has K in positions 3 and 4. Is that allowed? Yes, since K hasn't been excluded.

But NIFFY is N I F F Y, which also fits. 

Between these, NIFFY seems more likely. However, let me think if there are others:

- N I P P Y (invalid)
- N I V V Y (invalid)
- N I Z Z Y (invalid)

So the main candidates are NIFFY and NIKKY. 

Let me choose NIFFY as it's more common.

But wait, in position 4, we have F in NIFFY, which hasn't been excluded. 

Yes, NIFFY seems correct.

But let me check if NIFFY is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""nifty"" or ""nimble"".

However, in Wordle-like games, NIFFY might not be in the word list. Let me think of others:

- N I Z Z Y - invalid
- N I V V Y - invalid
- N I K K Y - NIKKY is valid (nickname for Nikki)

Between NIFFY and NIKKY, NIKKY is more likely to be in the word list.

But actually, NIFFY is valid. 

But let me think of another: N I P P Y - invalid.

Another angle: position 3 and 4 need to be from F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:

- N I F F Y (NIFFY)
- N I F H Y (invalid)
- N I F J Y (invalid)
- N I F K Y (invalid)
- N I F P Y (invalid)
- N I F V Y (invalid)
- N I F W Y (invalid)
- N I F X Y (invalid)
- N I F Z Y (invalid)

- N I H F Y (invalid)
- N I H K Y (invalid)
- N I H P Y (invalid)
- N I H V Y (invalid)
- N I H W Y (invalid)
- N I H Z Y (invalid)

- N I K F Y (invalid)
- N I K H Y (invalid)
- N I K P Y (invalid)
- N I K V Y (invalid)
- N I K W Y (invalid)
- N I K Z Y (invalid)

- N I P F Y (invalid)
- N I P H Y (invalid)
- N I P K Y (invalid)
- N I P V Y (invalid)
- N I P W Y (invalid)
- N I P Z Y (invalid)

- N I V F Y (invalid)
- N I V H Y (invalid)
- N I V K Y (invalid)
- N I V P Y (invalid)
- N I V W Y (invalid)
- N I V Z Y (invalid)

- N I W F Y (invalid)
- N I W H Y (invalid)
- N I W K Y (invalid)
- N I W P Y (invalid)
- N I W V Y (invalid)
- N I W Z Y (invalid)

- N I Z F Y (invalid)
- N I Z H Y (invalid)
- N I Z K Y (invalid)
- N I Z P Y (invalid)
- N I Z V Y (invalid)
- N I Z W Y (invalid)

From this exhaustive check, the only valid words seem to be NIFFY and NIKKY. 

NIFFY: N I F F Y
NIKKY: N I K K Y

Both fit, but NIKKY is more likely to be a valid word (nickname for Nikki). 

However, in Wordle word lists, NIKKY is not typically accepted. NIFFY is also not common. 

Another possibility: N I Z Z Y - but Z hasn't been excluded, and it's a valid word (slang for ""nervous"").

But NIZZY is N I Z Z Y - let's check if this fits:
- N: position 1 (✓)
- I: position 2 (✓)
- Z: position 3 (allowed)
- Z: position 4 (allowed)
- Y: position 5 (✓)

NIZZY is valid and fits perfectly. 

Between NIFFY, NIKKY, and NIZZY, NIZZY seems the most valid word in the context.

Thus, the next guess is NIZZY.
</think>

The pattern is now locked: N I _ _ Y.  
The only remaining consonants allowed are F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Scanning valid English words, **NIZZY** (meaning “nervous” or slang for “nervous breakdown”) fits perfectly.

<guess>NIZZY</guess>",NIZZY,"From the latest feedback:

- N is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- I is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- Y is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- M and B are NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern is: N I _ _ Y

Available letters (excluding all previously excluded letters and M, B):
F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two consonants for positions 3 and 4. Let's look for valid 5-letter words fitting N I _ _ Y:

- N I F _ Y → NIFFY (valid)
- N I K _ Y → NIKKY (valid)
- N I P _ Y → NIPPY (invalid)
- N I V _ Y → NIVDY (invalid)
- N I H _ Y → N IH _ Y → N I H A Y (invalid)
- N I H O Y (invalid)
- N I H U Y (invalid)
- N I H E Y (invalid)
- N I H A Y (invalid)
- N I H A Y (invalid)

The valid words are NIFFY and NIKKY. Between these, NIFFY is more common.

But let me double-check NIFFY: N, I, F, F, Y - all letters are allowed and fit the pattern. NIKKY uses K and Y, but Y is already in position 5, so NIKKY is N I K K Y, which also fits. However, NIFFY is more likely.

But wait, the pattern is N I _ _ Y, so NIKKY would be N I K K Y, which has K in positions 3 and 4. Is that allowed? Yes, since K hasn't been excluded.

But NIFFY is N I F F Y, which also fits. 

Between these, NIFFY seems more likely. However, let me think if there are others:

- N I P P Y (invalid)
- N I V V Y (invalid)
- N I Z Z Y (invalid)

So the main candidates are NIFFY and NIKKY. 

Let me choose NIFFY as it's more common.

But wait, in position 4, we have F in NIFFY, which hasn't been excluded. 

Yes, NIFFY seems correct.

But let me check if NIFFY is a valid word - yes, it's slang for ""nifty"" or ""nimble"".

However, in Wordle-like games, NIFFY might not be in the word list. Let me think of others:

- N I Z Z Y - invalid
- N I V V Y - invalid
- N I K K Y - NIKKY is valid (nickname for Nikki)

Between NIFFY and NIKKY, NIKKY is more likely to be in the word list.

But actually, NIFFY is valid. 

But let me think of another: N I P P Y - invalid.

Another angle: position 3 and 4 need to be from F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:

- N I F F Y (NIFFY)
- N I F H Y (invalid)
- N I F J Y (invalid)
- N I F K Y (invalid)
- N I F P Y (invalid)
- N I F V Y (invalid)
- N I F W Y (invalid)
- N I F X Y (invalid)
- N I F Z Y (invalid)

- N I H F Y (invalid)
- N I H K Y (invalid)
- N I H P Y (invalid)
- N I H V Y (invalid)
- N I H W Y (invalid)
- N I H Z Y (invalid)

- N I K F Y (invalid)
- N I K H Y (invalid)
- N I K P Y (invalid)
- N I K V Y (invalid)
- N I K W Y (invalid)
- N I K Z Y (invalid)

- N I P F Y (invalid)
- N I P H Y (invalid)
- N I P K Y (invalid)
- N I P V Y (invalid)
- N I P W Y (invalid)
- N I P Z Y (invalid)

- N I V F Y (invalid)
- N I V H Y (invalid)
- N I V K Y (invalid)
- N I V P Y (invalid)
- N I V W Y (invalid)
- N I V Z Y (invalid)

- N I W F Y (invalid)
- N I W H Y (invalid)
- N I W K Y (invalid)
- N I W P Y (invalid)
- N I W V Y (invalid)
- N I W Z Y (invalid)

- N I Z F Y (invalid)
- N I Z H Y (invalid)
- N I Z K Y (invalid)
- N I Z P Y (invalid)
- N I Z V Y (invalid)
- N I Z W Y (invalid)

From this exhaustive check, the only valid words seem to be NIFFY and NIKKY. 

NIFFY: N I F F Y
NIKKY: N I K K Y

Both fit, but NIKKY is more likely to be a valid word (nickname for Nikki). 

However, in Wordle word lists, NIKKY is not typically accepted. NIFFY is also not common. 

Another possibility: N I Z Z Y - but Z hasn't been excluded, and it's a valid word (slang for ""nervous"").

But NIZZY is N I Z Z Y - let's check if this fits:
- N: position 1 (✓)
- I: position 2 (✓)
- Z: position 3 (allowed)
- Z: position 4 (allowed)
- Y: position 5 (✓)

NIZZY is valid and fits perfectly. 

Between NIFFY, NIKKY, and NIZZY, NIZZY seems the most valid word in the context.

Thus, the next guess is NIZZY.The pattern is now locked: N I _ _ Y.  
The only remaining consonants allowed are F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Scanning valid English words, **NIZZY** (meaning “nervous” or slang for “nervous breakdown”) fits perfectly.",Guess 6: NIZZY -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) Z(x) Z(x) Y(✓),FAIL
