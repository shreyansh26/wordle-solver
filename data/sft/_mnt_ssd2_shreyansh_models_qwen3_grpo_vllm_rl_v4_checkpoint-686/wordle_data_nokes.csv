For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word contains S and E, but not L, A, or T.  
The letters S and E must appear somewhere else than positions 1 and 5 respectively.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep S and E in new positions.
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Introduce new common letters.

A balanced choice is “SEWER”:
- S moves to position 2 (allowed).
- E moves to position 1 (allowed).
- W and R are new common consonants.
- Double E is a valid word and tests E again in position 5 (but we already know E is in the word, so this is acceptable to confirm placement).

However, to maximize new information, let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
Next option: “ROSES”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
- R and O are new letters.
- Double S tests S again in position 5.

But “ROSES” has R, O, S, E, S – two S’s. That’s allowed but might be less informative.

A cleaner choice: “SHINE”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, same issue).

Best simple word: “REINS”:
- R, I, N are new letters.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).

This tests R, I, N while repositioning E and S.

Let’s update the constraints after the new feedback on DENSE:

1. S is confirmed at position 5 (✓ in guess 2).
2. E is in the word but NOT at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from REINS and DENSE).  
   Therefore E must be at position 1.
3. N is in the word but NOT at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from REINS and DENSE).  
   Therefore N must be at position 1, but position 1 is already taken by E.  
   This is impossible, so my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Re-examining:
- From DENSE: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT at position 3.
- From REINS: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- So N can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).
- From DENSE: E(-) means E is in the word but NOT at position 2, 3, or 4.  
  Therefore E must be at position 1.

Thus the word must be: E _ _ _ S with N somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word contains S and E, but not L, A, or T.  
The letters S and E must appear somewhere else than positions 1 and 5 respectively.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep S and E in new positions.
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Introduce new common letters.

A balanced choice is “SEWER”:
- S moves to position 2 (allowed).
- E moves to position 1 (allowed).
- W and R are new common consonants.
- Double E is a valid word and tests E again in position 5 (but we already know E is in the word, so this is acceptable to confirm placement).

However, to maximize new information, let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
Next option: “ROSES”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
- R and O are new letters.
- Double S tests S again in position 5.

But “ROSES” has R, O, S, E, S – two S’s. That’s allowed but might be less informative.

A cleaner choice: “SHINE”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, same issue).

Best simple word: “REINS”:
- R, I, N are new letters.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).

This tests R, I, N while repositioning E and S.

Current constraints:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5 confirmed), E, N.
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I.
- Positions:
  – S must be at position 5.
  – E is in the word but not at position 2 (from REINS).
  – N is in the word but not at position 4 (from REINS).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S
with E and N somewhere in positions 1-4, and one more unknown letter.

We still need to test common consonants and vowels not yet used: C, D, G, H, O, U, Y.

A good next word would:
1. Place S at position 5 (already done).
2. Try E and N in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate words:
- ""HENCE"" – H, C new; E at 2 (invalid, already ruled out)
- ""UNSET"" – U, N at 2, S at 5, E at 4 – but T is excluded
- ""NOSES"" – N at 1, O new, S at 5, E at 3 – valid
- ""GENES"" – G, N at 2, E at 3, S at 5 – valid
- ""DENSE"" – D, N at 2, S at 5, E at 4 – valid

""NOSES"" tests N at 2 and E at 3; introduces O.
""DENSE"" tests D at 1, N at 2, E at 4.
""GENES"" tests G at 1, N at 2, E at 3.

""DENSE"" gives the most new consonant (D) and keeps positions simple.

Let’s list the hard facts we now have:

1. S is locked at position 5.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ S

2. E is in the word but NOT at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from DENSE and ECHOS).  
   That’s impossible — a 5-letter word only has 5 positions, and every one is ruled out for E.  
   Therefore my interpretation of the feedback must have been wrong.

Re-checking the feedback symbols:
- (-) means “letter is in the word but in the wrong position.”
- (x) means “letter is not in the word.”

So:
- From SLATE: S(-) → S is in word, not at pos 1.  
- From ECHOS: E(-) → E is in word, not at pos 1.  
  That leaves E at positions 2, 3, or 4, but we still need to respect all feedback.

Let’s re-summarize all constraints:

Letters known to be in the word: S, E, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, I, D, C, H  

Positions:
- S must be at 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- E must be at 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1 or 5).
- N must be at 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 or 5).

We also know from Guess 3 (DENSE) that:
- N(-) → N is not at 3  
- E(-) → E is not at 2  
From Guess 2 (REINS):
- E(-) → E is not at 2  
- N(-) → N is not at 4  
From Guess 4 (ECHOS):
- O(-) → O is in word but not at 4  
- E(-) → E is not at 1  

So:
- E must be at 3 or 4 (cannot be 2, 1, or 5)  
- N must be at 1 or 2 (cannot be 3, 4, 5)  
- O must be at 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4)  

Let’s try to place them:

Case 1: N at 1, E at 3  
   N _ E _ S  
   The blank at 2 and 4 must be filled with remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already excluded letters).  
   We also know O is in the word (from DENSE), so O must be at 2 or 4.  
   Possible words:  
   - N O E _ S → but then O at 2, E at 3, need letter at 4.  
   - N _ E O S → but then O at 4 is invalid (O(-) from ECHOS).  

Case 2: N at 1, E at 4  
   N _ _ E S  
   Then O must be at 2 or 3.  
   Possible words:

<guess>NOBES</guess>",NOBES,"Let’s list the hard facts we now have:

1. S is locked at position 5.  
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ S

2. E is in the word but NOT at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from DENSE and ECHOS).  
   That’s impossible — a 5-letter word only has 5 positions, and every one is ruled out for E.  
   Therefore my interpretation of the feedback must have been wrong.

Re-checking the feedback symbols:
- (-) means “letter is in the word but in the wrong position.”
- (x) means “letter is not in the word.”

So:
- From SLATE: S(-) → S is in word, not at pos 1.  
- From ECHOS: E(-) → E is in word, not at pos 1.  
  That leaves E at positions 2, 3, or 4, but we still need to respect all feedback.

Let’s re-summarize all constraints:

Letters known to be in the word: S, E, N  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, A, T, R, I, D, C, H  

Positions:
- S must be at 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1).
- E must be at 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1 or 5).
- N must be at 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 or 5).

We also know from Guess 3 (DENSE) that:
- N(-) → N is not at 3  
- E(-) → E is not at 2  
From Guess 2 (REINS):
- E(-) → E is not at 2  
- N(-) → N is not at 4  
From Guess 4 (ECHOS):
- O(-) → O is in word but not at 4  
- E(-) → E is not at 1  

So:
- E must be at 3 or 4 (cannot be 2, 1, or 5)  
- N must be at 1 or 2 (cannot be 3, 4, 5)  
- O must be at 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4)  

Let’s try to place them:

Case 1: N at 1, E at 3  
   N _ E _ S  
   The blank at 2 and 4 must be filled with remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already excluded letters).  
   We also know O is in the word (from DENSE), so O must be at 2 or 4.  
   Possible words:  
   - N O E _ S → but then O at 2, E at 3, need letter at 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So the secret word contains S and E, but not L, A, or T.  
The letters S and E must appear somewhere else than positions 1 and 5 respectively.

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep S and E in new positions.
2. Avoid L, A, T.
3. Introduce new common letters.

A balanced choice is “SEWER”:
- S moves to position 2 (allowed).
- E moves to position 1 (allowed).
- W and R are new common consonants.
- Double E is a valid word and tests E again in position 5 (but we already know E is in the word, so this is acceptable to confirm placement).

However, to maximize new information, let’s try “SWEET”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
Next option: “ROSES”:
- S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed).
- R and O are new letters.
- Double S tests S again in position 5.

But “ROSES” has R, O, S, E, S – two S’s. That’s allowed but might be less informative.

A cleaner choice: “SHINE”:
- S in position 1 (invalid, same issue).

Best simple word: “REINS”:
- R, I, N are new letters.
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).

This tests R, I, N while repositioning E and S.

Guess 2: REINS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) I(x) N(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Letters in the word: S (position 5 confirmed), E, N.
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, I.
- Positions:
  – S must be at position 5.
  – E is in the word but not at position 2 (from REINS).
  – N is in the word but not at position 4 (from REINS).

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S
with E and N somewhere in positions 1-4, and one more unknown letter.

We still need to test common consonants and vowels not yet used: C, D, G, H, O, U, Y.

A good next word would:
1. Place S at position 5 (already done).
2. Try E and N in new positions.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate words:
- ""HENCE"" – H, C new; E at 2 (invalid, already ruled out)
- ""UNSET"" – U, N at 2, S at 5, E at 4 – but T is excluded
- ""NOSES"" – N at 1, O new, S at 5, E at 3 – valid
- ""GENES"" – G, N at 2, E at 3, S at 5 – valid
- ""DENSE"" – D, N at 2, S at 5, E at 4 – valid

""NOSES"" tests N at 2 and E at 3; introduces O.
""DENSE"" tests D at 1, N at 2, E at 4.
""GENES"" tests G at 1, N at 2, E at 3.

""DENSE"" gives the most new consonant (D) and keeps positions simple.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

Guess 3: DENSE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) N(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update the constraints after the new feedback on DENSE:

1. S is confirmed at position 5 (✓ in guess 2).
2. E is in the word but NOT at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from REINS and DENSE).  
   Therefore E must be at position 1.
3. N is in the word but NOT at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from REINS and DENSE).  
   Therefore N must be at position 1, but position 1 is already taken by E.  
   This is impossible, so my earlier assumption must be wrong.

Re-examining:
- From DENSE: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT at position 3.
- From REINS: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
- So N can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).
- From DENSE: E(-) means E is in the word but NOT at position 2, 3, or 4.  
  Therefore E must be at position 1.

Thus the word must be: E _ _ _ S with N somewhere in positions 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- E N _ _ S
- E _ N _ S

Letters used so far (excluded): L, A, T, R, I, D.
Remaining common letters: C, G, H, O, U, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- ENOSS – but double S not ideal
- ENSIS – double S again
- ECHOS – C, H, O: fits E N _ _ S pattern
- EGNOS – G, N, O: fits E _ N _ S pattern
- EUNOS – U, N, O: fits E _ N _ S pattern

""ECHOS"" is a valid word, tests C and H, and fits E N _ _ S.

- E must be at 2, 3, or 4 (but not 1 or 5).

We also know from Guess 3 (DENSE) that:

   N _ _ E S  
   Then O must be at 2 or 3.  
   Possible words:  
   - N O _ E S → need letter at 3.  
   - N _ O E S → but O at 3 is allowed.  

Case 3: N at 2, E at 3

   Then O must be at 1 or 3.  
   - O N _ E S → need letter at 3.  
   - _ N O E S → but O at 3 is allowed.  

Let’s pick one of the viable patterns and fill with common remaining letters.

The feedback from NOBES shows every letter is in the correct position:

N(✓)  O(✓)  B(x)  E(✓)  S(✓)

This means:
- N is in position 1
- O is in position 2
- E is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- B is not in the word (and we already knew B wasn't used)

So the word structure is: N O _ E S

We just need to find the correct letter for position 3. From previous feedback, we know the letters NOT in the word are: L, A, T, R, I, D, C, H, B.

Looking at the remaining alphabet, common letters that fit here would be: F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

The most common 5-letter word that fits N O _ E S is ""NOVES"" (though this might be less common), but a more common word is ""NOSES"" - but S is already used in position 5 and can't repeat in this context.

Another common word is ""NOVES"" but that's not a standard word. The actual standard word is ""NOSES"" but that repeats S.

Looking again, the correct word is actually ""NOSES"" - but since S is already at position 5, this would imply two S's, which is possible in English but might be less likely.

However, the more likely word is ""NOVES"" - but this is not valid. The correct valid word is ""NOSES"".

But let me double-check: N O _ E S. The valid word here is ""NOSES"" - but this has two S's. 

But in the word ""NOSES"":
- N is at 1 ✓
- O is at 2 ✓
- S is at 3 (new position)
- E is at 4 ✓
- S is at 5 ✓

This fits all constraints. 

Thus, the word must be ""NOSES"".
