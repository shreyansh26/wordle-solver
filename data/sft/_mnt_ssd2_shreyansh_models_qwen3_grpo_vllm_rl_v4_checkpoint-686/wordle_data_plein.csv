### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

- CLERK (but has K, which is less common)
- FLEET (but has T, which is excluded)
- PLUME (but has U and M, which are less common)
- GLUED (but has D, which is less common)
- BLIND (but has N and D, which are less common)

A better approach is to use common letters we haven't ruled out yet. Remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, C, H, D, G, M, P, B, F, K, U, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ L _ _ _ (L is locked in position 2).
2. The letters S, A, T, F, R are NOT in the word.
3. The letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from SLATE and FLIER feedback).
4. The letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from FLIER feedback).

So E must be in position 1 or 3, and I must be in position 1, 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in position 2.
- Contains E in position 1 or 3.
- Contains I in position 1, 4 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: E in position 1
- E L _ _ _
  - Need I in position 4 or 5.
  - Possible words: ELINT (but T is ruled out), ELBOW (O, W allowed), ELGIN (N allowed), ELDER (D, R ruled out).

Case 2: E in position 3
- _ L E _ _
  - Need I in position 1, 4 or 5.
  - Possible words: B L E N D (D allowed), C L E F T (T ruled out), D L E N T (T ruled out), G L E N D (D allowed), P L E N D (D allowed), V L E N D (D allowed), etc.

Looking at valid options:
- B L E N D
- C L E N D
- G L E N D
- P L E N D
- V L E N D
- E L B O W
- E L G I N
- E L V I N

Among these, ""BLEND"" seems like a strong candidate as it uses common letters B, L, E, N, D and fits all constraints:
- L is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- I is not present in BLEND, but we know I must be in the word. So BLEND is invalid.

Next option: ""ELGIN"" - E in 1, L in 2, I in 5. Uses E, L, G, I, N. All letters allowed.
- E (position 1) - allowed
- L (position 2) - locked ✓
- G - new letter
- I (position 5) - allowed
- N - new letter

Now we have:

4. Letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from SLATE, FLIER, ELGIN feedback).  
   Therefore E must be in position 2, but position 2 is already L.  
   This is impossible, so our assumption must be wrong.

Wait: re-read the feedback carefully.

From ELGIN:
- E(-) : E is in the word but NOT in position 1
- L(✓) : L is correct in position 2
- G(x) : G is not in the word
- I(✓) : I is correct in position 4
- N(✓) : N is correct in position 5

So the word must be: _ L _ I N  
and it must contain E somewhere, but E cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
The only remaining position for E is position 3.

Thus the pattern is: _ L E I N

Now we need a 5-letter word matching: ? L E I N

Possible letters for position 1 (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

Valid words:

- KLEIN (proper noun, not allowed)
- MLEIN (not valid)
- OLEIN (valid, variant of ""oleum"")
- PLEIN (as in ""plein air"")
- WLEIN (not valid)

""PLEIN"" is a valid English word (archaic/poetic for ""open-air""), but more commonly ""Oleyn"" is a surname, but ""OLEIN"" is acceptable.

However, ""BLEIN"" is not valid, but ""BLEED"" is invalid because we know E is in position 3, not 2.

Wait, the pattern is _ L E I N, so possible valid words:
- BLEIN (invalid)

Only ""OLEIN"" seems valid, but it's a bit obscure. However, ""OLEIN"" is recognized as a chemical compound.

But let's double-check: is there another word?

Actually, ""BLEED"" is invalid because pattern is _ L E I N.

Looking again, the only valid word matching _ L E I N is ""BLEIN"" which is not valid, ""CLEIN"" not valid, etc. This suggests ""OLEIN"" is the only possible.

But ""OLEIN"" uses O, L, E, I, N - all allowed letters, fits _ L E I N.

Thus, the next guess must be OLEIN.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 2nd letter is L
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E is somewhere, but not 5th

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Must contain E (but not at position 5)
- Must not contain S, A, or T

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 2nd position and E somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4). Let's brainstorm:

Possible words:
- BLEED (but has two E's, and we only know E is present once)
- CLERK (but has K, which is less common)
- FLEET (but has T, which is excluded)
- PLUME (but has U and M, which are less common)
- GLUED (but has D, which is less common)
- BLIND (but has N and D, which are less common)

A better approach is to use common letters we haven't ruled out yet. Remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, C, H, D, G, M, P, B, F, K, U, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let's try:
- FLIER (F, L, I, E, R) - uses common letters and fits the constraints
- BLIND (B, L, I, N, D) - also good
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) - another good option

""FLIER"" seems good as it uses F, L, I, E, R - all common letters, with E in position 4 (not 5), and L in position 2.

3. The letter E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from SLATE and FLIER feedback).
4. The letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from FLIER feedback).

So E must be in position 1 or 3, and I must be in position 1, 4 or 5.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, G, H, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in position 2.
- Contains E in position 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: E in position 1
- E L _ _ _
  - Need I in position 4 or 5.
  - Possible words: ELINT (but T is ruled out), ELBOW (O, W allowed), ELGIN (N allowed), ELDER (D, R ruled out).

  - Need I in position 1, 4 or 5.
  - Possible words: B L E N D (D allowed), C L E F T (T ruled out), D L E N T (T ruled out), G L E N D (D allowed), P L E N D (D allowed), V L E N D (D allowed), etc.

Looking at valid options:
- B L E N D
- C L E N D
- G L E N D
- P L E N D
- V L E N D
- E L B O W
- E L G I N
- E L V I N

- I is not present in BLEND, but we know I must be in the word. So BLEND is invalid.

Some popular choices include:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n\nAmong these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

- I is correct in position 4 (✓)
- N is correct in position 5 (✓)
