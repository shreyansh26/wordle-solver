1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – P and D are not in the word.  
   – O is now in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – E is now in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), E (fixed at position 4), S (somewhere else).  
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D.  
- S cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses), and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) or 5 (from first guess), so S must be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is forbidden, so S must be in position 1.

Current pattern:  
S _ O E _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in position 2 and E in position 4, and does not contain A, R, P, D.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 5: from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, P, D, and excluding S, O, E. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words matching S _ O E _:
- SCOED? Not a word.
- SHOED? Valid word (past tense of shoe).
- SPOED? Not a word.
- STOED? Not a word.
- SLOED? Not a word.
- SMOTE? Has M and T, but T is allowed. ""SMOTE"" is a valid word (past tense of smite).

Between SHOED and SMOTE:
- SHOED: uses H (allowed), no forbidden letters.
- SMOTE: uses M and T (both allowed).

Both fit, but let's try SHOED first as it uses H which is common.

Pattern: S H O E _

Now we just need a valid letter for position 5. Looking at remaining letters (not A, R, P, D, S, O, E, H), common ones: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y.

Possible endings: SHOEB? SHOEF? SHOEG? SHOEM? SHOEN? SHOOT? SHOOW? SHOYE?

""SHOED"" is already the past tense, but we need a new word. ""SHOES"" would be plural, but S is already used. ""SHOEN"" is not common. ""SHOOT"" is valid (past tense of shoot). But we need to check if T is allowed (yes, not forbidden).

So ""SHOOT"" fits: S H O O T. But we have E in position 4, so this would be S H O O T which conflicts with E in position 4. Wait, no - the pattern is S H O E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting S H O E _.

Looking up, ""SHOES"" is S H O E S - but S is already in position 1. ""SHOED"" is S H O E D - but D is forbidden. ""SHOEN"" is not a standard word. ""SHOEM"" is not standard. ""SHOET"" is not standard. ""SHOEL"" is not standard. ""SHOER"" is not standard (R is forbidden).

Actually, looking back at the pattern: S _ O E _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). From feedback:
- Position 2 must be O (✓).
- Position 4 must be E (✓).
- Position 1 must be S (as deduced).
- Positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

So the word is S O _ E _? Wait no - position 2 is O, position 4 is E, so the word is S _ O E _.

Looking for 5-letter words in this pattern:
- S C O E ? Not a word.
- S T O E ? Not a word.
- S M O E ? Not a word.
- S L O E ? ""SLOES"" is plural of slope, but S is already used. ""SLOES"" is S L O E S - but S is already in position 1.
- S W O E ? Not a word.
- S G O E ? Not a word.
- S B O E ? Not a word.
- S F O E ? Not a word.
- S K O E ? Not a word.
- S N O E ? Not a word.
- S Y O E ? Not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints carefully:
From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POSED).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from POSED).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from POSED: S was in position 3, but now in POSED S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S cannot be in position 4. From POSED, S cannot be in position 3. So S must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is open, position 5 is open.

So possible positions for S: 1 or 5.

But in POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

But in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.

So possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)

Looking for words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don't know about duplicates.

- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):
  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.
  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""WOES"" - too short.
  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).
  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.
  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.
  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.

From these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.

Looking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.

But let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.

So I'll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.

Testing the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn't yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". 

""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.

- S B O E ? Not a word.
- S F O E ? Not a word.
- S K O E ? Not a word.
- S N O E ? Not a word.
- S Y O E ? Not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints carefully:
From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POSED).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from POSED).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from POSED: S was in position 3, but now in POSED S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S cannot be in position 4. From POSED, S cannot be in position 3. So S must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is open, position 5 is open.

So possible positions for S: 1 or 5.

But in POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

But in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.

So possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)

Looking for words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don't know about duplicates.

- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):
  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.
  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""WOES"" - too short.
  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).
  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.
  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.
  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.

From these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.

Looking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.

But let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.

So I'll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.

Testing the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn't yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". 

""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.",Guess 3: COVES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT include A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in different positions than before (O not 3rd, S not 4th, E not 5th).

Possible positions for O, S, E:
- O can be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. Let’s try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D.
- No A or R.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3).
- S is now in position 3 (was 4).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5).

This seems valid and tests new consonants (P, D).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – P and D are not in the word.  
   – O is now in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – E is now in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), E (fixed at position 4), S (somewhere else).  
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D.  
- S cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses), and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) or 5 (from first guess), so S must be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is forbidden, so S must be in position 1.

Current pattern:  
S _ O E _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in position 2 and E in position 4, and does not contain A, R, P, D.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 5: from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, P, D, and excluding S, O, E. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words matching S _ O E _:
- SCOED? Not a word.
- SHOED? Valid word (past tense of shoe).
- SPOED? Not a word.
- STOED? Not a word.
- SLOED? Not a word.
- SMOTE? Has M and T, but T is allowed. ""SMOTE"" is a valid word (past tense of smite).

Between SHOED and SMOTE:
- SHOED: uses H (allowed), no forbidden letters.
- SMOTE: uses M and T (both allowed).

Both fit, but let's try SHOED first as it uses H which is common.

Pattern: S H O E _

Now we just need a valid letter for position 5. Looking at remaining letters (not A, R, P, D, S, O, E, H), common ones: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y.

Possible endings: SHOEB? SHOEF? SHOEG? SHOEM? SHOEN? SHOOT? SHOOW? SHOYE?

""SHOED"" is already the past tense, but we need a new word. ""SHOES"" would be plural, but S is already used. ""SHOEN"" is not common. ""SHOOT"" is valid (past tense of shoot). But we need to check if T is allowed (yes, not forbidden).

So ""SHOOT"" fits: S H O O T. But we have E in position 4, so this would be S H O O T which conflicts with E in position 4. Wait, no - the pattern is S H O E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting S H O E _.

Looking up, ""SHOES"" is S H O E S - but S is already in position 1. ""SHOED"" is S H O E D - but D is forbidden. ""SHOEN"" is not a standard word. ""SHOEM"" is not standard. ""SHOET"" is not standard. ""SHOEL"" is not standard. ""SHOER"" is not standard (R is forbidden).

Actually, looking back at the pattern: S _ O E _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). From feedback:
- Position 2 must be O (✓).
- Position 4 must be E (✓).
- Position 1 must be S (as deduced).
- Positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

So the word is S O _ E _? Wait no - position 2 is O, position 4 is E, so the word is S _ O E _.

Looking for 5-letter words in this pattern:
- S C O E ? Not a word.
- S T O E ? Not a word.
- S M O E ? Not a word.
- S L O E ? ""SLOES"" is plural of slope, but S is already used. ""SLOES"" is S L O E S - but S is already in position 1.
- S W O E ? Not a word.
- S G O E ? Not a word.
- S B O E ? Not a word.
- S F O E ? Not a word.
- S K O E ? Not a word.
- S N O E ? Not a word.
- S Y O E ? Not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints carefully:
From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POSED).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from POSED).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from POSED: S was in position 3, but now in POSED S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S cannot be in position 4. From POSED, S cannot be in position 3. So S must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is open, position 5 is open.

So possible positions for S: 1 or 5.

But in POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

But in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.

So possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)

Looking for words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don't know about duplicates.

- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):
  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.
  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""WOES"" - too short.
  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).
  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.
  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.
  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.

From these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.

Looking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.

But let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.

So I'll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.

Testing the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn't yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". 

""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT include A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in different positions than before (O not 3rd, S not 4th, E not 5th).

Possible positions for O, S, E:
- O can be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. Let’s try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D.
- No A or R.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3).
- S is now in position 3 (was 4).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5).

This seems valid and tests new consonants (P, D).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – P and D are not in the word.  
   – O is now in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – E is now in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), E (fixed at position 4), S (somewhere else).  
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D.  
- S cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses), and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) or 5 (from first guess), so S must be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is forbidden, so S must be in position 1.

Current pattern:  
S _ O E _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in position 2 and E in position 4, and does not contain A, R, P, D.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 5: from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, P, D, and excluding S, O, E. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words matching S _ O E _:
- SCOED? Not a word.
- SHOED? Valid word (past tense of shoe).
- SPOED? Not a word.
- STOED? Not a word.
- SLOED? Not a word.
- SMOTE? Has M and T, but T is allowed. ""SMOTE"" is a valid word (past tense of smite).

Between SHOED and SMOTE:
- SHOED: uses H (allowed), no forbidden letters.
- SMOTE: uses M and T (both allowed).

Both fit, but let's try SHOED first as it uses H which is common.

Pattern: S H O E _

Now we just need a valid letter for position 5. Looking at remaining letters (not A, R, P, D, S, O, E, H), common ones: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y.

Possible endings: SHOEB? SHOEF? SHOEG? SHOEM? SHOEN? SHOOT? SHOOW? SHOYE?

""SHOED"" is already the past tense, but we need a new word. ""SHOES"" would be plural, but S is already used. ""SHOEN"" is not common. ""SHOOT"" is valid (past tense of shoot). But we need to check if T is allowed (yes, not forbidden).

So ""SHOOT"" fits: S H O O T. But we have E in position 4, so this would be S H O O T which conflicts with E in position 4. Wait, no - the pattern is S H O E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting S H O E _.

Looking up, ""SHOES"" is S H O E S - but S is already in position 1. ""SHOED"" is S H O E D - but D is forbidden. ""SHOEN"" is not a standard word. ""SHOEM"" is not standard. ""SHOET"" is not standard. ""SHOEL"" is not standard. ""SHOER"" is not standard (R is forbidden).

Actually, looking back at the pattern: S _ O E _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). From feedback:
- Position 2 must be O (✓).
- Position 4 must be E (✓).
- Position 1 must be S (as deduced).
- Positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

So the word is S O _ E _? Wait no - position 2 is O, position 4 is E, so the word is S _ O E _.

Looking for 5-letter words in this pattern:
- S C O E ? Not a word.
- S T O E ? Not a word.
- S M O E ? Not a word.
- S L O E ? ""SLOES"" is plural of slope, but S is already used. ""SLOES"" is S L O E S - but S is already in position 1.
- S W O E ? Not a word.
- S G O E ? Not a word.
- S B O E ? Not a word.
- S F O E ? Not a word.
- S K O E ? Not a word.
- S N O E ? Not a word.
- S Y O E ? Not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints carefully:
From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POSED).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from POSED).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from POSED: S was in position 3, but now in POSED S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S cannot be in position 4. From POSED, S cannot be in position 3. So S must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is open, position 5 is open.

So possible positions for S: 1 or 5.

But in POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

But in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.

So possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)

Looking for words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don't know about duplicates.

- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):
  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.
  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""WOES"" - too short.
  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).
  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.
  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.
  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.

From these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.

Looking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.

But let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.

So I'll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.

Testing the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn't yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". 

""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence or absence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or R.
- Contains O, S, and E, but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O, S, and E.
2. Does NOT include A or R.
3. Places O, S, and E in different positions than before (O not 3rd, S not 4th, E not 5th).

Possible positions for O, S, E:
- O can be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S can be 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints. Let’s try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D.
- No A or R.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3).
- S is now in position 3 (was 4).
- E is now in position 4 (was 5).

This seems valid and tests new consonants (P, D).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)  
   – A and R are not in the word.  
   – O, S, E are in the word but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively.

2. POSED → P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – P and D are not in the word.  
   – O is now in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – E is now in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), E (fixed at position 4), S (somewhere else).  
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D.  
- S cannot be in position 3 (from both guesses), and cannot be in position 4 (because E is there) or 5 (from first guess), so S must be in position 1 or 3. But position 3 is forbidden, so S must be in position 1.

Current pattern:  
S _ O E _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has O in position 2 and E in position 4, and does not contain A, R, P, D.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 5: from the remaining alphabet excluding A, R, P, D, and excluding S, O, E. Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words matching S _ O E _:
- SCOED? Not a word.
- SHOED? Valid word (past tense of shoe).
- SPOED? Not a word.
- STOED? Not a word.
- SLOED? Not a word.
- SMOTE? Has M and T, but T is allowed. ""SMOTE"" is a valid word (past tense of smite).

Between SHOED and SMOTE:
- SHOED: uses H (allowed), no forbidden letters.
- SMOTE: uses M and T (both allowed).

Both fit, but let's try SHOED first as it uses H which is common.

Pattern: S H O E _

Now we just need a valid letter for position 5. Looking at remaining letters (not A, R, P, D, S, O, E, H), common ones: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, N, T, W, Y.

Possible endings: SHOEB? SHOEF? SHOEG? SHOEM? SHOEN? SHOOT? SHOOW? SHOYE?

""SHOED"" is already the past tense, but we need a new word. ""SHOES"" would be plural, but S is already used. ""SHOEN"" is not common. ""SHOOT"" is valid (past tense of shoot). But we need to check if T is allowed (yes, not forbidden).

So ""SHOOT"" fits: S H O O T. But we have E in position 4, so this would be S H O O T which conflicts with E in position 4. Wait, no - the pattern is S H O E _, so we need a 5-letter word starting S H O E _.

Looking up, ""SHOES"" is S H O E S - but S is already in position 1. ""SHOED"" is S H O E D - but D is forbidden. ""SHOEN"" is not a standard word. ""SHOEM"" is not standard. ""SHOET"" is not standard. ""SHOEL"" is not standard. ""SHOER"" is not standard (R is forbidden).

Actually, looking back at the pattern: S _ O E _ (positions 1,2,3,4,5). From feedback:
- Position 2 must be O (✓).
- Position 4 must be E (✓).
- Position 1 must be S (as deduced).
- Positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

So the word is S O _ E _? Wait no - position 2 is O, position 4 is E, so the word is S _ O E _.

Looking for 5-letter words in this pattern:
- S C O E ? Not a word.
- S T O E ? Not a word.
- S M O E ? Not a word.
- S L O E ? ""SLOES"" is plural of slope, but S is already used. ""SLOES"" is S L O E S - but S is already in position 1.
- S W O E ? Not a word.
- S G O E ? Not a word.
- S B O E ? Not a word.
- S F O E ? Not a word.
- S K O E ? Not a word.
- S N O E ? Not a word.
- S Y O E ? Not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints carefully:
From feedback:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from POSED).
- E is in position 4 (✓ from POSED).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 (from POSED: S was in position 3, but now in POSED S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S cannot be in position 4. From POSED, S cannot be in position 3. So S must be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is open, position 5 is open.

So possible positions for S: 1 or 5.

But in POSED, S was in position 3 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 3. From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.

But in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.

So possible patterns:
- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)
- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)

Looking for words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don't know about duplicates.

- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):
  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.
  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""WOES"" - too short.
  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.
  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).
  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.
  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.
  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.
  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.

From these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.

Looking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.

But let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.

So I'll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.

Testing the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn't yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". 

""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.

From AROSE, S was in position 4 and got (-), so S cannot be in position 4. So S must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nBut in POSED, O is in position 2 (✓), E in position 4 (✓), so the word is: _ O _ E _ with S somewhere.\n\nSo possible patterns:\n- S O _ E _ (S in position 1)\n- _ O _ E S (S in position 5)\n\nLooking for words:\n- S O _ E _: ""SOARE"" - but R is forbidden. ""SOAKS"" - A is forbidden. ""SOBES"" - not a word. ""SODAS"" - A, D, S. ""SOFTS"" - not standard. ""SOILE"" - not a word. ""SOLAR"" - A, R. ""SOLDS"" - D. ""SONIC"" - not matching. ""SONGS"" - G, S. ""SOONS"" - N, S. ""SOOTY"" - Y. ""SOOTY"" is S O O T Y - but O is in position 2, so this would be S O O T Y which has O in position 2 and 3, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n- _ O _ E S (S in position 5):\n  - ""COVES"" - C, O, V, E, S. But V is not yet tested, but allowed. But we have no info about C, V. But from feedback, we have no info about C yet. But we need to avoid A, R, P, D.\n  - ""FOGES"" - F, O, G, E, S. Valid word.\n  - ""MOGES"" - not standard.\n  - ""WOES"" - too short.\n  - ""TOLES"" - T, O, L, E, S. Valid word.\n  - ""HOSES"" - H, O, S, E, S. But S is in position 3 which is forbidden (from POSED: S was in position 3 and got (-)).\n  - ""BOGES"" - not standard.\n  - ""NOSES"" - N, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.\n  - ""GOSES"" - not standard.\n  - ""TOSES"" - T, O, S, E, S. S is in position 3 and 5 - position 3 is forbidden.\n\nFrom these, ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"" seem valid. ""COVES"" uses C, O, V, E, S. ""FOGES"" uses F, O, G, E, S. ""TOLES"" uses T, O, L, E, S.\n\nLooking for which of these are more common: ""COVES"" is valid, ""TOLES"" is less common, ""FOGES"" is valid but less common. ""COVES"" seems better.\n\nBut let me check if any of these have forbidden letters: A, R, P, D. None of these have A, R, P, D.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""COVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:\n- O is confirmed in position 2.\n- E is confirmed in position 4.\n- S must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be in 3 or 4).\n- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, P, D.\n\nTesting the pattern `_ O _ E _` with S in position 1 gives the word ""SO**"" which doesn\'t yield valid 5-letter words easily. Testing with S in position 5 gives valid words like ""COVES"", ""FOGES"", ""TOLES"". \n\n""COVES"" is a strong candidate as it uses common letters not yet eliminated.\n\n<guess>COVES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: COVES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on COVES:\n- C and V are NOT in the word (x).\n- O is still correct in position 2 (✓).\n- E is still correct in position 4 (✓).\n- S is now correct in position 5 (✓).\n\nSo the secret word has the fixed pattern:\n_  O  _  E  S\n\nLetters already ruled out: A, R, P, D, C, V.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word matching: ?

We now have the fixed pattern _ O _ E S and the following letters ruled out:

A, R, P, D, C, V, H, L, G

The first letter must be one we have not yet tried. From the alphabet, unused consonants include F, J, K, M, N, Q, T, W, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? O ? E S.

Common words fitting this:
- F O K E S – “FOKES” is not a standard word.
- F O M E S – “FOMES” is not a standard word.
- F O N E S – “FONES” is not standard.
- J O K E S – “JOKES” is valid.
- M O N E S – “MONES” is not standard.
- T O N E S – “TONES” is valid.
- W O N E S – “WONES” is archaic.
- Y O N E S – “YONES” is not standard.

The two strongest candidates are “JOKES” and “TONES”.

Both use letters not yet excluded:
- J and K for “JOKES”.
- T and N for “TONES”.

“TONES” is a very common word, so it is the safer guess.
