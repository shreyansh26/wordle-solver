### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""ADIEU"" are good options. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain: L, T, E
- Does contain: S and A, but S is not in position 1 and A is not in position 3.

Next guess should:
1. Include S and A in new positions.
2. Avoid L, T, E.
3. Introduce new common letters.

Good candidate: ""SOUND"" - but this has O and U which are good vowels, and N/D are common consonants. However, it doesn't include A.

Better: ""RAISE"" - but this has E which we know is not in the word.

Another: ""SANDY"" - has S and A, but Y is less common.

Best: ""CRASH"" - but has C and H which are less common.

Let's try ""SANDY"" - positions S(1) and A(3) are same as before, which is bad since we know they're wrong.

Try ""SALAD"" - but A is repeated which might not be optimal.

Try ""SABIN"" - has S and A, but I and N are less common.

Try ""SARGE"" - has E which is out.

Try ""SARAN"" - has A and S, but R and N are good letters.

""SARAN"" seems good: S(2), A(3) - positions changed from SLATE, and introduces R, N.

But A is in position 3 in SLATE and we know A is not in position 3, so in SARAN it's A(3) again - bad.

Try ""SANDY"" - A is position 2, S is position 1. In SLATE, S was position 1 (wrong), A was position 3 (wrong). In SANDY, S is position 1 (same as SLATE, which is wrong), A is position 2 (new). So S is still in wrong position.

Try ""SALTY"" - S(1) is wrong, A(2) is new, L is out.

Try ""SARAN"" - A(3) is same as SLATE, wrong.

Try ""SUNAS"" - S(5) is new, A(3) is same as SLATE - wrong.

Try ""SACRA"" - S(1) is wrong, A(2) and A(5) are new, C and R are good.

""SACRA"" seems best so far: S(1) is wrong (as before), A(2) and A(5) are new positions, and introduces C and R.

But let's try ""SARAN"" again with A in position 2: ""SARAN"" has A(2) and A(4), but A is only in word once, so probably not.

Try ""SABIN"" - S(1) is wrong, A(2) is new, B and I are less common.

Try ""SANDY"" - S(1) is wrong, A(2) is new, N and D are good.

""SANDY"" seems better: S(1) is wrong (as before), A(2) is new, N and D are new common letters.

But we can do better: ""SALSA"" - but has S multiple times.

Try ""SANDY"" - seems best so far.

Another: ""SUGAR"" - has U, G, R, and A(4), S(1). S(1) is wrong, A(4) is new, U, G, R are good.

""SUGAR"" seems good: S(1) is wrong, A(4) is new, U, G, R are new letters.

But we know A is in word but not in position 3, so position 4 is fine.

""SUGAR"" is a strong next guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

What we now know:

- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 4 (from SUGAR).
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, U, G, R.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A exactly once each.
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- A is in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- No L, T, E, U, G, R anywhere.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: N, D, H, C, M, P, B, F, Y, K, etc.
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: I, O (since A is already confirmed, and U, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and A.
- Avoids positions 1 for S, 3 and 4 for A.
- Avoids letters L, T, E, U, G, R.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 5.

Try S in position 2 and A in position 1: A S _ _ _
But then we need three more letters, none of which can be the forbidden ones.
Possible: A S I D _ – but we need a 5-letter word.

Try A S I N D – not a word.
A S C O D – not a word.

Try A S H O N – “ASHON” is not valid.

Try A S P I N – “ASPIN” is not valid.

Try S in position 3 and A in position 1: A _ S _ _
A B S I D – “ABSID” is not valid.

Try A C S I D – not valid.

Try S in position 4 and A in position 1: A _ _ S _
A C I S D – “ACISD” is not valid.

Try A N S I S – but S is repeated, and we don’t know if S is repeated.

Try A N S O N – “ANSON” is a proper noun but not a common word.

Try S in position 2 and A in position 5: _ S _ _ A
Possible: C S I D A – “CSIDA” is not valid.

Try N S I D A – “NSIDA” is not valid.

Try S in position 3 and A in position 5: _ _ S _ A
Possible: C I S C A – “CISCA” is not valid.

Try N I S S A – “NISCA” is not valid.

Try S in position 5 and A in position 1: A _ _ _ S
A C I D S – “ACIDS” is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A in position 1 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,3,4).
- Letters used: A, C, I, D, S – none of the forbidden letters (L,T,E,U,G,R) are used.
- All letters are unique, which is fine since we only know S and A are in the word, not necessarily once each, but we have no evidence for duplicates.

Thus, “ACIDS” is a valid next guess.

<guess>ACIDS</guess>",ACIDS,"From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: SUGAR → S(-) U(x) G(x) A(-) R(x)

What we now know:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from both guesses).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) and NOT in position 4 (from SUGAR).
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, T, E, U, G, R.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A exactly once each.
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- A is in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- No L, T, E, U, G, R anywhere.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: N, D, H, C, M, P, B, F, Y, K, etc.
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: I, O (since A is already confirmed, and U, E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and A.
- Avoids positions 1 for S, 3 and 4 for A.
- Avoids letters L, T, E, U, G, R.

Let’s look for words that fit:
- Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 5.

Try S in position 2 and A in position 1: A S _ _ _
But then we need three more letters, none of which can be the forbidden ones.

Try A N S I S – but S is repeated, and we don’t know if S is repeated.
