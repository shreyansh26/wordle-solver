- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- No A, R, O, S, or E.
- The word must be made entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

From the new feedback:

- U, T, L are not in the word at all (x).
- N and I are in the word, but N is in the wrong position (it was 2nd in UNTIL) and I is in the correct 4th position (I(✓)).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Letters in the word: N, I (with I fixed at position 4)
- We still need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eight letters above).

Good next consonants to try: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y
Good next vowels to try: none left (only U was left, and it’s out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the 4th position
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ I _ with N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N _ _ I _ : e.g., NINJI (invalid, not a word), NIKI_ (need 5 letters)
- _ N _ I _ : e.g., B N _ I _ → BN?I? (not common)
- _ _ N I _ : e.g., C H N I D (invalid), P A N I C (A is out), B R I N D (R is out)
- _ _ _ I N : e.g., C H I N E (E is out), P I N G I (invalid), D I N I N (invalid)

Wait, let’s list valid English words fitting _ _ _ I N or _ _ N I _ or N _ _ I _ with no forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – I is 4th, N is 3rd (allowed), all letters new
- PINKY (P, I, N, K, Y) – same
- WINCH (W, I, N, C, H) – same
- BINGO (B, I, N, G, O) – O is out
- CHINK (C, H, I, N, K) – I is 3rd, not 4th

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- No A, R, O, S, or E.
- The word must be made entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five entirely new letters and includes some of the next-most-common letters that weren’t in AROSE.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (Y is sometimes treated as a vowel).

A balanced choice is “UNTIL” – it uses three new vowels (U, I) and two new consonants (N, L) that weren’t in AROSE.  
Another candidate is “DUMPY” or “BLUNT,” but “UNTIL” gives a nice mix of common letters.

I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

From the new feedback:

- U, T, L are not in the word at all (x).
- N and I are in the word, but N is in the wrong position (it was 2nd in UNTIL) and I is in the correct 4th position (I(✓)).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Letters in the word: N, I (with I fixed at position 4)
- We still need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eight letters above).

Good next consonants to try: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y
Good next vowels to try: none left (only U was left, and it’s out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the 4th position
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ I _ with N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N _ _ I _ : e.g., NINJI (invalid, not a word), NIKI_ (need 5 letters)
- _ N _ I _ : e.g., B N _ I _ → BN?I? (not common)
- _ _ N I _ : e.g., C H N I D (invalid), P A N I C (A is out), B R I N D (R is out)
- _ _ _ I N : e.g., C H I N E (E is out), P I N G I (invalid), D I N I N (invalid)

Wait, let’s list valid English words fitting _ _ _ I N or _ _ N I _ or N _ _ I _ with no forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – I is 4th, N is 3rd (allowed), all letters new
- PINKY (P, I, N, K, Y) – same
- WINCH (W, I, N, C, H) – same
- BINGO (B, I, N, G, O) – O is out
- CHINK (C, H, I, N, K) – I is 3rd, not 4th
- NINNY – N is 1st and 4th, but I is 2nd and 3rd, doesn’t fit I at 4th

Best fit: DINGY or PINKY or WINCH. All use new letters and satisfy constraints.

I’ll pick DINGY.

Let's update what we now know after the fourth guess:

1. Letters completely ruled out (x in any position):
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, Y, C, H, K

2. Letters whose positions have been tested and rejected:
   - I was marked ✓ in position 4 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 3 (CHINK).  
     This means I is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.  
   - N was marked ✓ in position 3 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 4 (CHINK).  
     This means N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.

3. Therefore:
   - I must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - N must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded).
   - The remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven't used yet).

4. Pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ _ _ with I and N somewhere in positions 1-2-5 and no banned letters.

5. Possible patterns to consider:
   - I _ N _ _ (e.g., I N _ _ _ but N can't be in position 2 because it would be position 2 in the word, which is allowed since we only know N isn't in 3 or 4)
   - _ I N _ _ (but N can't be in 3, so this would be _ I N _ _ which conflicts)
   - _ _ I N _ (but I can't be in 3 and N can't be in 4, so this is invalid)
   - _ _ _ I N (possible, with I in 5 and N in 5 - but both can't be in 5)
   - N _ I _ _ (possible, N in 1, I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - N _ _ I _ (possible, N in 1, I in 4 - but I can't be in 4)
   - _ N _ I _ (possible, N in 2, I in 4 - but I can't be in 4)
   - _ _ N I _ (possible, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ _ _ N I (possible, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)

6. Valid patterns:
   - I _ _ _ N (I in 1, N in 5)
   - I _ _ N _ (I in 1, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)
   - I _ N _ _ (I in 1, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ I _ _ N (I in 2, N in 5)
   - _ I _ N _ (I in 2, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)
   - _ I N _ _ (I in 2, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ _ I _ N (I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - _ _ _ I N (I in 5, N in 5 - impossible)
   - N _ _ _ I (N in 1, I in 5)
   - N _ _ I _ (N in 1, I in 4 - but I can't be in 4)
   - N _ I _ _ (N in 1, I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - N _ _ _ I (same as above)

7. The only valid patterns that satisfy all constraints are:
   - I _ _ _ N (I in 1, N in 5)
   - _ I _ _ N (I in 2, N in 5)
   - N _ _ _ I (N in 1, I in 5)

8. Now we need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns using only the still-allowed letters (B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

9. Let's check each pattern:
   - I _ _ _ N: The word must start with I and end with N. Possible letters in positions 2-4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. We need a valid English word.

10. The most promising candidate is ""INBOX"" which fits the I _ _ _ N pattern and uses only allowed letters (B, X are allowed).

11. Let's verify:
   - I is in position 1 (allowed, since we only know I isn't in 3 or 4)
   - N is in position 5 (allowed)
   - B, X are not in the banned list
   - ""INBOX"" is a valid English word

<guess>INBOX</guess>",INBOX,"Let's update what we now know after the fourth guess:

1. Letters completely ruled out (x in any position):
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, Y, C, H, K

2. Letters whose positions have been tested and rejected:
   - I was marked ✓ in position 4 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 3 (CHINK).  
     This means I is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.  
   - N was marked ✓ in position 3 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 4 (CHINK).  
     This means N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.

3. Therefore:
   - I must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - N must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded).
   - The remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven't used yet).

4. Pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ _ _ with I and N somewhere in positions 1-2-5 and no banned letters.

5. Possible patterns to consider:
   - I _ N _ _ (e.g., I N _ _ _ but N can't be in position 2 because it would be position 2 in the word, which is allowed since we only know N isn't in 3 or 4)
   - _ I N _ _ (but N can't be in 3, so this would be _ I N _ _ which conflicts)
   - _ _ I N _ (but I can't be in 3 and N can't be in 4, so this is invalid)
   - _ _ _ I N (possible, with I in 5 and N in 5 - but both can't be in 5)
   - N _ I _ _ (possible, N in 1, I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - N _ _ I _ (possible, N in 1, I in 4 - but I can't be in 4)

   - _ _ N I _ (possible, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ _ _ N I (possible, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)

6. Valid patterns:
   - I _ _ _ N (I in 1, N in 5)
   - I _ _ N _ (I in 1, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)
   - I _ N _ _ (I in 1, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)

   - _ I _ _ N (I in 2, N in 5)

8. Now we need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns using only the still-allowed letters (B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

9. Let's check each pattern:
   - I _ _ _ N: The word must start with I and end with N. Possible letters in positions 2-4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. We need a valid English word. Possible candidates: ""INBOX"", ""INBOW"", ""INBUN"" (invalid), ""INFON"" (invalid), ""INMAN"" (valid but M is allowed), ""INPUN"" (invalid). ""INBOX"" is a valid word.
   - _ I _ _ N: The word has I in position 2 and N in 5. Possible letters in positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Possible candidates: ""BIVIN"" (invalid), ""FIVIN"" (invalid), ""MIVIN"" (invalid), ""PIVIN"" (invalid), ""WIVIN"" (invalid). Not many valid options here.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- No A, R, O, S, or E.
- The word must be made entirely from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

To maximize information on the next guess, I should pick a word that uses five entirely new letters and includes some of the next-most-common letters that weren’t in AROSE.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (Y is sometimes treated as a vowel).

A balanced choice is “UNTIL” – it uses three new vowels (U, I) and two new consonants (N, L) that weren’t in AROSE.  
Another candidate is “DUMPY” or “BLUNT,” but “UNTIL” gives a nice mix of common letters.

I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback:

- U, T, L are not in the word at all (x).
- N and I are in the word, but N is in the wrong position (it was 2nd in UNTIL) and I is in the correct 4th position (I(✓)).

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L
- Letters in the word: N, I (with I fixed at position 4)
- We still need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eight letters above).

Good next consonants to try: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y
Good next vowels to try: none left (only U was left, and it’s out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the 4th position
- Contains N somewhere (but not in position 2)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible patterns: _ _ _ I _ with N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N _ _ I _ : e.g., NINJI (invalid, not a word), NIKI_ (need 5 letters)
- _ N _ I _ : e.g., B N _ I _ → BN?I? (not common)
- _ _ N I _ : e.g., C H N I D (invalid), P A N I C (A is out), B R I N D (R is out)
- _ _ _ I N : e.g., C H I N E (E is out), P I N G I (invalid), D I N I N (invalid)

Wait, let’s list valid English words fitting _ _ _ I N or _ _ N I _ or N _ _ I _ with no forbidden letters.

Valid candidates:
- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – I is 4th, N is 3rd (allowed), all letters new
- PINKY (P, I, N, K, Y) – same
- WINCH (W, I, N, C, H) – same
- BINGO (B, I, N, G, O) – O is out
- CHINK (C, H, I, N, K) – I is 3rd, not 4th
- NINNY – N is 1st and 4th, but I is 2nd and 3rd, doesn’t fit I at 4th

Best fit: DINGY or PINKY or WINCH. All use new letters and satisfy constraints.

I’ll pick DINGY.

Guess 3: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(x)

From the new feedback:

- D, G, Y are not in the word (x).
- I is still correct at position 4 (✓).
- N is now correct at position 3 (✓).

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ N I _

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, Y.

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: only I is used (position 4), so other positions must be consonants.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- 3rd letter = N
- 4th letter = I
- No letters from the banned list
- Valid English word

Possible patterns: _ _ N I _

Let’s list valid English words fitting _ _ N I _ with no banned letters:
- B I N I D (invalid, D is out)
- C H I N A (A is out)
- F I N I T (invalid, T is out)
- H I N N Y (invalid, Y is out)
- K I N G S (G is out)
- M I N I M (invalid)
- P I N N Y (invalid)
- V I N I L (invalid, L is out)
- W I N D Y (D, Y are out)
- C H I N K (valid, C, H, I, N, K)
- P I N C H (valid, P, I, N, C, H)
- F I N C H (valid, F, I, N, C, H)

All these use new letters and fit the constraints. I’ll pick CHINK.

Let's update what we now know after the fourth guess:

1. Letters completely ruled out (x in any position):
   A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, Y, C, H, K

2. Letters whose positions have been tested and rejected:
   - I was marked ✓ in position 4 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 3 (CHINK).  
     This means I is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.  
   - N was marked ✓ in position 3 (DINGY), but now marked – in position 4 (CHINK).  
     This means N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4.

3. Therefore:
   - I must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - N must appear in position 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded).
   - The remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven't used yet).

4. Pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ _ _ with I and N somewhere in positions 1-2-5 and no banned letters.

5. Possible patterns to consider:
   - I _ N _ _ (e.g., I N _ _ _ but N can't be in position 2 because it would be position 2 in the word, which is allowed since we only know N isn't in 3 or 4)

   - _ _ N I _ (possible, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ _ _ N I (possible, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)

6. Valid patterns:
   - I _ _ _ N (I in 1, N in 5)
   - I _ _ N _ (I in 1, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)
   - I _ N _ _ (I in 1, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ I _ _ N (I in 2, N in 5)
   - _ I _ N _ (I in 2, N in 4 - but N can't be in 4)
   - _ I N _ _ (I in 2, N in 3 - but N can't be in 3)
   - _ _ I _ N (I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - _ _ _ I N (I in 5, N in 5 - impossible)
   - N _ _ _ I (N in 1, I in 5)
   - N _ _ I _ (N in 1, I in 4 - but I can't be in 4)
   - N _ I _ _ (N in 1, I in 3 - but I can't be in 3)
   - N _ _ _ I (same as above)

7. The only valid patterns that satisfy all constraints are:
   - I _ _ _ N (I in 1, N in 5)
   - _ I _ _ N (I in 2, N in 5)
   - N _ _ _ I (N in 1, I in 5)

8. Now we need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns using only the still-allowed letters (B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

9. Let's check each pattern:
   - I _ _ _ N: The word must start with I and end with N. Possible letters in positions 2-4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. We need a valid English word. Possible candidates: ""INBOX"", ""INBOW"", ""INBUN"" (invalid), ""INFON"" (invalid), ""INMAN"" (valid but M is allowed), ""INPUN"" (invalid). ""INBOX"" is a valid word.
   - _ I _ _ N: The word has I in position 2 and N in 5. Possible letters in positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Possible candidates: ""BIVIN"" (invalid), ""FIVIN"" (invalid), ""MIVIN"" (invalid), ""PIVIN"" (invalid), ""WIVIN"" (invalid). Not many valid options here.

10. The most promising candidate is ""INBOX"" which fits the I _ _ _ N pattern and uses only allowed letters (B, X are allowed).

11. Let's verify:
   - I is in position 1 (allowed, since we only know I isn't in 3 or 4)

Now we need to find 5-letter words that fit one of these patterns using only the still-allowed letters (B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).\n\n9. Let\'s check each pattern:\n   - I _ _ _ N: The word must start with I and end with N. Possible letters in positions 2-4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. We need a valid English word. Possible candidates: ""INBOX"", ""INBOW"", ""INBUN"" (invalid), ""INFON"" (invalid), ""INMAN"" (valid but M is allowed), ""INPUN"" (invalid). ""INBOX"" is a valid word.\n   - _ I _ _ N: The word has I in position 2 and N in 5. Possible letters in positions 1, 3, 4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Possible candidates: ""BIVIN"" (invalid), ""FIVIN"" (invalid), ""MIVIN"" (invalid), ""PIVIN"" (invalid), ""WIVIN"" (invalid). Not many valid options here.\n   - N _ _ _ I: The word starts with N and ends with I. Possible letters in positions 2-4: B, F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. Possible candidates: ""NIBBI"" (invalid), ""NIFFI"" (invalid), ""NIMMI"" (invalid), ""NIPPY"" (Y is out), ""NIVVI"" (invalid). Not many valid options here.\n\n10. The most promising candidate is ""INBOX"" which fits the I _ _ _ N pattern and uses only allowed letters (B, X are allowed).\n\n11. Let\'s verify:\n   - I is in position 1 (allowed, since we only know I isn\'t in 3 or 4)\n   - N is in position 5 (allowed)\n   - B, X are not in the banned list\n   - ""INBOX"" is a valid English word\n\n<guess>INBOX</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(✓) L(x)\nGuess 3: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: CHINK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)\nGuess 5: INBOX -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(-) B(-) O(x) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters completely ruled out (x in any position):
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, D, G, Y, C, H, K, B, X, O

Letters confirmed to be in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- I (must appear, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- N (must appear, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5)

Allowed letters (have never been guessed):
F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Z

Positions for I and N:
Since they can’t be in 3,4,5, the only possible positions left are:
- I can be in position 1 or 2
- N can be in position 1 or 2

We need a 5-letter word that contains both I and N exactly once each, uses only the allowed letters for the remaining slots, and places I and N in positions 1 or 2.

Possible patterns:
1. I N _ _ _
2. I _ N _ _
3. I _ _ _ N (invalid, N can’t be in 5)
4. N I _ _ _
5. N _ I _ _ (invalid, I can’t be in 3)
6. N _ _ _ I (invalid, I can’t be in 5)

Valid patterns:
- I N _ _ _
- I _ N _ _
- N I _ _ _

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns using only the allowed letters (F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Z) in the remaining positions.

1. I N _ _ _:
   - INFIN (invalid)
   - INJUM (invalid)
   - INPUM (invalid)
   - INVUM (invalid)
   - INWUM (invalid)
   - No valid words here.

2. I _ N _ _:
   - I _ N _ _ with allowed letters:
     - I F N _ _ (IFN… no)
     - I M N _ _ (IMN… no)
     - I P N _ _ (IPN… no)
     - I V N _ _ (IVN… no)
     - I W N _ _ (IWN… no)
   - No valid words here either.

3. N I _ _ _:
   - N I _ _ _ with allowed letters:
     - N I F F Y (Y is out)
     - N I F F Z (invalid)
     - N I M M Y (Y is out)
     - N I P P Y (Y is out)
     - N I V V Y (Y is out)
     - N I W W Y (Y is out)
   - The only valid word that comes to mind is NINNY, but Y is banned.

Wait, let’s re-examine the allowed letters. We have never used F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Z. The word must contain I and N, and the other three letters must be from {F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Z}.

Let’s try N I _ _ _:
- N I F F Y (invalid, Y is out)
- N I F F Z (invalid)
- N I F J P (invalid)
- N I M P Z (invalid)
- N I V P Z (invalid)
- N I W P Z (invalid)
- N I P P Z (invalid)

Similarly for I N _ _ _ and I _ N _ _.

But wait, let’s think of the word “PINNY” – but Y is out.

Another approach: maybe the word is “VINYL” – but L is out.

“MINCY” – C is out.

“JINNY” – Y is out.

“FINNY” – Y is out.

“PINNY” – Y is out.

“ZINGY” – Z, I, N, G, Y – G and Y are out.

“WIMPY” – Y is out.

“PIMPY” – Y is out.

“VINNY” – Y is out.

“NINNY” – Y is out.

Hmm, seems like we’re running out of options. Let me double-check the allowed letters and positions.

Actually, the word must be 5 letters, contain I and N exactly once each, and the other three letters must be from {F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, Z}. Also, I and N must be in positions 1 or 2.

Let’s list all possible combinations:

Positions 1-2 must be a permutation of I and N.

Case 1: I N _ _ _
   - I N F _ _ (need two more letters from allowed set)
   - Possible: I N F J P, I N F J M, etc. but these don’t form words.
   - The only valid word I can think of is “INFIX” – but X is out.

Case 2: N I _ _ _
   - N I F _ _ (need two more letters)
   - Possible: N I F J P (invalid), N I F M P (invalid), etc.
   - The word “NIF…” doesn’t seem to form a valid English word.

Case 3: I _ N _ _
   - I _ N _ _ (positions 2 and 4-5 need allowed letters)
   - Possible: I F N P Z (invalid), I M N P Z (invalid), etc.
   - Doesn’t seem to form a valid word.
