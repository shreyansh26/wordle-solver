### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- It covers different positions for these letters to help identify correct placements

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:

- A (from SLATE, wrong at pos 3; from ARSON, wrong at pos 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, T, E, R, O, N

So the secret word:
- Must contain both A and S exactly once each.
- A is not in position 1 or 3.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- May not contain L, T, E, R, O, N.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and S, using only the allowed letters, and placing A and S in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since they can’t be 1 or 3).

Possible positions for A and S:
- A in 2, S in 4 or 5
- A in 4, S in 2 or 5
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- A in 2, S in 4: _A_S_ → e.g., CASHY (but Y is allowed), but CASHY has H and Y which are allowed.
- A in 2, S in 5: _A__S_ → e.g., BASIN (but N is excluded), DASHS (invalid), etc.
- A in 4, S in 2: _S_A__ → e.g., SWAMP (W, M, P allowed), but P is allowed.
- A in 4, S in 5: ___A_S → e.g., CUBAS (B, U allowed), but B and U are allowed.
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4: _S___A or _A___S → e.g., SUSHY (but H, Y allowed), but S is in 1 (invalid), so _A___S → e.g., CAVAS (but V, C allowed), but A is duplicated.

Let’s try “SWAMP”:
- Letters: S, W, A, M, P – none are excluded.
- S is in position 1 (invalid per feedback).
So no.

Try “CUBAS”:
- Letters: C, U, B, A, S – none are excluded.
- A is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed).
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBAS.

- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
- T is not in the word at all
- E is not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but neither is in the positions they occupied in SLATE
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and A
2. Excludes L, T, E
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good candidate letters to add: R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.

A word that fits: ""CRASH"" (but H is new, S is in position 4, A is in position 3 - but A can't be in position 3)
Another: ""SNARF"" (but F is new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SANDY"" (but Y is new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SARGE"" (but E is excluded)
Another: ""SARIN"" (I and N are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SABIN"" (B and N are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SCARF"" (C, R, F are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SNARL"" (but L is excluded)
Another: ""SANDY"" (already considered)
Another: ""SARDO"" (O is new, S in 1 - can't be)

Wait, let's try ""SANDY"" - but S is in position 1, which is invalid.
""SARDO"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SCARF"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SNARF"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SABER"" - E is excluded.
""SABIN"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SARGE"" - E is excluded.

Alternative: ""ARSON"" (but S is in position 4, A in position 1 - this could work)
""ARSON"" uses A and S, excludes L/T/E, S not in position 1, A not in position 3.

But does it have both A and S? Yes: A in 1, S in 4.
Letters: A, R, S, O, N - none are L/T/E.

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) S(-) O(x) N(x)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
- S (from SLATE, wrong at pos 1; from ARSON, wrong at pos 3)  
- A (from SLATE, wrong at pos 3; from ARSON, wrong at pos 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, T, E, R, O, N

So the secret word:
- Must contain both A and S exactly once each.
- A is not in position 1 or 3.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- May not contain L, T, E, R, O, N.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and S, using only the allowed letters, and placing A and S in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since they can’t be 1 or 3).

Possible positions for A and S:
- A in 2, S in 4 or 5
- A in 4, S in 2 or 5
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- A in 2, S in 4: _A_S_ → e.g., CASHY (but Y is allowed), but CASHY has H and Y which are allowed.
- A in 2, S in 5: _A__S_ → e.g., BASIN (but N is excluded), DASHS (invalid), etc.
- A in 4, S in 2: _S_A__ → e.g., SWAMP (W, M, P allowed), but P is allowed.
- A in 4, S in 5: ___A_S → e.g., CUBAS (B, U allowed), but B and U are allowed.
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4: _S___A or _A___S → e.g., SUSHY (but H, Y allowed), but S is in 1 (invalid), so _A___S → e.g., CAVAS (but V, C allowed), but A is duplicated.

Let’s try “SWAMP”:
- Letters: S, W, A, M, P – none are excluded.
- S is in position 1 (invalid per feedback).
So no.

Try “CUBAS”:
- Letters: C, U, B, A, S – none are excluded.
- A is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed).
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBAS.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- It covers different positions for these letters to help identify correct placements

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
- T is not in the word at all
- E is not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but neither is in the positions they occupied in SLATE
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and A
2. Excludes L, T, E
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good candidate letters to add: R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.

Another: ""SNARF"" (but F is new, S in 1 - can't be)

Alternative: ""ARSON"" (but S is in position 4, A in position 1 - this could work)
""ARSON"" uses A and S, excludes L/T/E, S not in position 1, A not in position 3.

- A (from SLATE, wrong at pos 3; from ARSON, wrong at pos 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:

So the secret word:
- Must contain both A and S exactly once each.
- A is not in position 1 or 3.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- May not contain L, T, E, R, O, N.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and S, using only the allowed letters, and placing A and S in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since they can’t be 1 or 3).

Possible positions for A and S:
- A in 2, S in 4 or 5

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- A in 2, S in 4: _A_S_ → e.g., CASHY (but Y is allowed), but CASHY has H and Y which are allowed.
- A in 2, S in 5: _A__S_ → e.g., BASIN (but N is excluded), DASHS (invalid), etc.
- A in 4, S in 2: _S_A__ → e.g., SWAMP (W, M, P allowed), but P is allowed.
- A in 4, S in 5: ___A_S → e.g., CUBAS (B, U allowed), but B and U are allowed.
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4: _S___A or _A___S → e.g., SUSHY (but H, Y allowed), but S is in 1 (invalid), so _A___S → e.g., CAVAS (but V, C allowed), but A is duplicated.

Let’s try “SWAMP”:
- Letters: S, W, A, M, P – none are excluded.
- S is in position 1 (invalid per feedback).
So no.

Try “CUBAS”:
- Letters: C, U, B, A, S – none are excluded.
- A is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed).
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBAS.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words
- It covers different positions for these letters to help identify correct placements

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3)
- T is not in the word at all
- E is not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but neither is in the positions they occupied in SLATE
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and A
2. Excludes L, T, E
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1
4. Places A somewhere other than position 3

Good candidate letters to add: R, I, N, O, C, H, etc.

A word that fits: ""CRASH"" (but H is new, S is in position 4, A is in position 3 - but A can't be in position 3)
Another: ""SNARF"" (but F is new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SANDY"" (but Y is new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SARGE"" (but E is excluded)
Another: ""SARIN"" (I and N are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SABIN"" (B and N are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SCARF"" (C, R, F are new, S in 1 - can't be)
Another: ""SNARL"" (but L is excluded)
Another: ""SANDY"" (already considered)
Another: ""SARDO"" (O is new, S in 1 - can't be)

Wait, let's try ""SANDY"" - but S is in position 1, which is invalid.
""SARDO"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SCARF"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SNARF"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SABER"" - E is excluded.
""SABIN"" - S in position 1, invalid.
""SARGE"" - E is excluded.

Alternative: ""ARSON"" (but S is in position 4, A in position 1 - this could work)
""ARSON"" uses A and S, excludes L/T/E, S not in position 1, A not in position 3.

But does it have both A and S? Yes: A in 1, S in 4.
Letters: A, R, S, O, N - none are L/T/E.

This seems valid.

Guess 2: ARSON -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) S(-) O(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions:
- S (from SLATE, wrong at pos 1; from ARSON, wrong at pos 3)  
- A (from SLATE, wrong at pos 3; from ARSON, wrong at pos 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, T, E, R, O, N

So the secret word:
- Must contain both A and S exactly once each.
- A is not in position 1 or 3.
- S is not in position 1 or 3.
- May not contain L, T, E, R, O, N.

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A and S, using only the allowed letters, and placing A and S in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since they can’t be 1 or 3).

Possible positions for A and S:
- A in 2, S in 4 or 5
- A in 4, S in 2 or 5
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4

Let’s look for a word that fits:
- A in 2, S in 4: _A_S_ → e.g., CASHY (but Y is allowed), but CASHY has H and Y which are allowed.
- A in 2, S in 5: _A__S_ → e.g., BASIN (but N is excluded), DASHS (invalid), etc.
- A in 4, S in 2: _S_A__ → e.g., SWAMP (W, M, P allowed), but P is allowed.
- A in 4, S in 5: ___A_S → e.g., CUBAS (B, U allowed), but B and U are allowed.
- A in 5, S in 2 or 4: _S___A or _A___S → e.g., SUSHY (but H, Y allowed), but S is in 1 (invalid), so _A___S → e.g., CAVAS (but V, C allowed), but A is duplicated.

Let’s try “SWAMP”:
- Letters: S, W, A, M, P – none are excluded.
- S is in position 1 (invalid per feedback).
So no.

Try “CUBAS”:
- Letters: C, U, B, A, S – none are excluded.
- A is in position 4 (allowed), S is in position 5 (allowed).
This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CUBAS.

- Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, R, O, N, C, U, B
- Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that ends in “AS” and has only the allowed letters in the first three positions.

Possible patterns: X X X A S

Looking at common words:
- DASHS – invalid (double S, S already used once)
- FASHS – invalid

- HAZAS – not a valid word
- JAZZY – ends in Y
- KAZAS – not common
- MASHS – invalid
- PASHS – invalid
- WASHS – invalid
- YACHT – ends in T (invalid)
- ZAPAS – ends in S, but P and Z are allowed.

“ZAPAS” is a valid 5-letter word (plural of zapata, a regional term), and it fits:
- Z, A, P, A, S – only A and S are confirmed, and it ends in AS.
- Z, P are not yet excluded.

Since we have only one more guess left before we’d have to guess blindly, let’s try ZAPAS.

The only common word left is “DASHS”, but it repeats S.  
Next plausible candidate is “FASHS”, also invalid.

Looking again, “HABAS” is invalid (B out).  
“GAMAS” is not standard.

However, “HADAS” is a valid English word (a Hebrew name), and its letters H, A, D, A, S are all allowed.

Therefore, the remaining logical choice is HADAS.
