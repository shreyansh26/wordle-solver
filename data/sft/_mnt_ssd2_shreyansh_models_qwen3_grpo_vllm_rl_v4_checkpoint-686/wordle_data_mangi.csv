1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Still uses common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

A word like ""TAINT"" would use A in position 2 and include common consonants T and N, but it repeats T and might not give enough new info.

""PLANT"" uses A in position 3, and introduces P, L, N, T - all common letters not ruled out yet.

Another option is ""CANTY"" but Y is less common and might not be optimal.

""PLANT"" seems like a strong second guess to test new common letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, D, E, L, O, P, R, S, T.  
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

- I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
- Only letters from the remaining pool: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible patterns:

- I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

A promising pattern: N A _ I _  
But N cannot be in position 1 if A is in position 2 (the word would start N-A... which is fine).  
Word: N A _ I _ → N A M I _ → N A M I D (but D is out).  
N A M I C (C is out).  
N A M I K → NAMIK? Not a valid English word.

Another pattern: _ A N _ I  
Positions: 1,2,3,4,5 → 1:A, 2:A, 3:N, 4:?, 5:I.  
But A is fixed at position 2, so this would be _ A N _ I.  
Valid word: M A N G I → check letters: M, A, N, G, I.  
All letters are allowed (M, G are still in play).  
N is in position 3 → but earlier feedback says N is NOT in position 3 (from CANID feedback: N(✓) means it’s in the word but not in position 3).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word right away, whether they're in the correct position or just present in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does not contain R, O, S, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.
3. Still uses common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

A word like ""TAINT"" would use A in position 2 and include common consonants T and N, but it repeats T and might not give enough new info.

""PLANT"" uses A in position 3, and introduces P, L, N, T - all common letters not ruled out yet.

Another option is ""CANTY"" but Y is less common and might not be optimal.

""PLANT"" seems like a strong second guess to test new common letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ A is in the word but not in position 1.  
→ R, O, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: PLANT  
Feedback: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)  
→ P, L, T are not in the word.  
→ A is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ N is in the word but not in position 4.

Known facts so far:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, T.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A and N.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 and 3.
- Position ruled out for N: 4.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A is already confirmed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and N.
2. Places A in positions 2, 4, or 5.
3. Places N in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, O, S, E, P, L, T).

Let’s look for such a word.  
A simple candidate: “CANID”
- C, I, D are allowed.  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

Another candidate: “MANGY”
- M, G, Y are allowed.  
- A in position 2, N in position 3.  
- No forbidden letters.

“CANID” and “MANGY” both fit.  
Between them, “CANID” uses more common letters and the vowel I, so I’ll go with that.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – P, L, T are not in the word.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

3. CANID → C(x) A(✓) N(✓) I(-) D(x)  
   – C, D are not in the word.  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.

4. BANKI → B(x) A(✓) N(✓) K(x) I(✓)  
   – B, K are not in the word.  
   – A is confirmed in position 2.  
   – N is confirmed in position 3 (✓).  
   – I is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So the word structure is now:  
_ A N _ I

Letters used so far in the word: A, N, I.  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: B, C, D, E, K, L, O, P, R, S, T.

Remaining possible letters for the two blank positions (1 and 4):  
F, G, H, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern _ A N _ I.

Possible candidates:  
F A N G I → FANGI (not a common word)  
G A N G I → GANGI (not common)  
H A N D I → HANDB (invalid)  
M A N G I → MANGI (valid variant)  
V A N D I → VANDI (not common)  
W A N D I → WANDI (not common)  
Y A N G I → YANGI (not common)

The most common and valid word fitting _ A N _ I is M A N G I.

Check letters: M, A, N, G, I.  
All letters are allowed (M, G are still in play).  
Positions:  
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  
- I is in position 5 (✓)  

Thus, MANGI is the logical next guess.
