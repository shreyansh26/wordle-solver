For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better positioned because it has the vowels in different positions compared to ""SLATE"", which could give more positional information. But both are valid starting guesses. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every vowel (A, O, E) and the consonants R and S.

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids those letters entirely.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced starter word using common remaining letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It has two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been ruled out.

Other candidates like “MIGHT”, “BLUNT”, or “PRINT” would also work, but “UNTIL” feels like a solid choice for the second guess.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters eliminated so far:
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M

Letters confirmed to be in the word but with unknown positions:
U (from UNTIL and DUMPY), P (from DUMPY), Y (from DUMPY)

So the secret word must contain U, P, Y and two other letters that have not been eliminated.

Remaining letters (not yet tested and not eliminated):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that contains U, P, Y and two of these remaining letters. Let's try to find such a word.

Possible combinations:
- U, P, Y plus two consonants from the remaining list.

Let's think of words with these letters:
- ""JUPY?"" - but we need 5 letters.
- ""CUPPY"" - but P is already in the word and we have Y at the end, but this has two P's which might not be efficient.
- ""FUGLY"" - but G and L, but L is eliminated.
- ""HUMPY"" - but M is eliminated.
- ""VULPY"" - but V and L, L is eliminated.
- ""CUPPY"" - as above, two P's.
- ""BUMPY"" - M is eliminated.
- ""GUPPY"" - G and P, but two P's.

Hmm, let's think differently. We know the word has U, P, Y and two other letters. Let's try ""CUPPY"" - but this has two P's. Maybe ""CUPPY"" is valid but not ideal.

Another approach: ""JUPY?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Maybe ""JUPPY"" but that's similar.

Wait, let's try ""CUPPY"" - C, U, P, P, Y. This has U, P, Y and C. But P is repeated. Maybe this is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a better word. ""FUGLY"" - but L is eliminated. ""HUGLY"" - L is eliminated. ""BUGGY"" - G and B, but two G's.

Actually, ""CUPPY"" seems to be the closest valid word with U, P, Y and one additional letter C. Let's check if C is allowed - yes, C hasn't been eliminated.

But ""CUPPY"" has two P's, which might not be the most efficient. Let's see if there's another word.

""GUPPY"" - G, U, P, P, Y. This has two P's as well.

""KUPPY"" - K, U, P, P, Y. This seems similar.

""VUPPY"" - V, U, P, P, Y.

""JUPPY"" - J, U, P, P, Y.

""BUPPY"" - B, U, P, P, Y.

""ZUPPY"" - Z, U, P, P, Y.

These all seem similar. Let's try ""CUPPY"" as it's a valid word.

But wait, let's think of other words with U, P, Y. Maybe ""UPPY?"" - but we need two more letters.

""UPPY?"" - but we need 5 letters. Maybe ""UPPY?"" is not valid.

Another approach: ""JUPY?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Maybe ""JUPPY"" is the closest.

Given the constraints, ""CUPPY"" seems to be the most plausible word that includes U, P, Y and one additional letter C.

But let's double-check: C, U, P, P, Y - all letters are allowed (C, U, P, Y are not eliminated), and it's a valid 5-letter word.

So I'll go with CUPPY.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must contain U, P, and Y (since they were marked “-” in previous guesses), and cannot contain any of the letters already ruled out (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M). The remaining letters that haven’t been tested yet are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A valid 5-letter word that uses U, P, Y and two of these remaining letters is “CUPPY” (C, U, P, P, Y). It includes the required letters and only uses allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better positioned because it has the vowels in different positions compared to ""SLATE"", which could give more positional information. But both are valid starting guesses. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every vowel (A, O, E) and the consonants R and S.

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids those letters entirely.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced starter word using common remaining letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It has two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been ruled out.

Other candidates like “MIGHT”, “BLUNT”, or “PRINT” would also work, but “UNTIL” feels like a solid choice for the second guess.

So far we have eliminated:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: U (from UNTIL)

Therefore:
- The word contains the letter U.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L.
- Remaining unused letters include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U at least once.
2. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
3. Is a valid English word.

Let’s try to place U in a position where it can reveal more consonants.  
A good candidate is “DUMPY” (D, U, M, P, Y).  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- U appears in position 2, giving us positional information.  
- The consonants D, M, P, Y are all still possible.

Another candidate could be “FUMED”, but E is already eliminated.  
“HUMPY” is also possible, but “DUMPY” feels slightly more common.

I’ll go with DUMPY.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word. However, another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better positioned because it has the vowels in different positions compared to ""SLATE"", which could give more positional information. But both are valid starting guesses. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every vowel (A, O, E) and the consonants R and S.

We need a new 5-letter word that avoids those letters entirely.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A balanced starter word using common remaining letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It has two vowels (U, I) and three consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been ruled out.

Other candidates like “MIGHT”, “BLUNT”, or “PRINT” would also work, but “UNTIL” feels like a solid choice for the second guess.

So far we have eliminated:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: U (from UNTIL)

Therefore:
- The word contains the letter U.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L.
- Remaining unused letters include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U at least once.
2. Uses only letters from the “allowed” set above.
3. Is a valid English word.

Let’s try to place U in a position where it can reveal more consonants.  
A good candidate is “DUMPY” (D, U, M, P, Y).  
- All letters are still allowed.  
- U appears in position 2, giving us positional information.  
- The consonants D, M, P, Y are all still possible.

Another candidate could be “FUMED”, but E is already eliminated.  
“HUMPY” is also possible, but “DUMPY” feels slightly more common.

I’ll go with DUMPY.

From the three guesses we have:

Letters eliminated so far:
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M

Letters confirmed to be in the word but with unknown positions:
U (from UNTIL and DUMPY), P (from DUMPY), Y (from DUMPY)

So the secret word must contain U, P, Y and two other letters that have not been eliminated.

Remaining letters (not yet tested and not eliminated):
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need to form a 5-letter word that contains U, P, Y and two of these remaining letters. Let's try to find such a word.

Possible combinations:
- U, P, Y plus two consonants from the remaining list.

Let's think of words with these letters:
- ""JUPY?"" - but we need 5 letters.
- ""CUPPY"" - but P is already in the word and we have Y at the end, but this has two P's which might not be efficient.
- ""FUGLY"" - but G and L, but L is eliminated.
- ""HUMPY"" - but M is eliminated.
- ""VULPY"" - but V and L, L is eliminated.
- ""CUPPY"" - as above, two P's.
- ""BUMPY"" - M is eliminated.
- ""GUPPY"" - G and P, but two P's.

Hmm, let's think differently. We know the word has U, P, Y and two other letters. Let's try ""CUPPY"" - but this has two P's. Maybe ""CUPPY"" is valid but not ideal.

Another approach: ""JUPY?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Maybe ""JUPPY"" but that's similar.

Wait, let's try ""CUPPY"" - C, U, P, P, Y. This has U, P, Y and C. But P is repeated. Maybe this is acceptable.

But let's see if there's a better word. ""FUGLY"" - but L is eliminated. ""HUGLY"" - L is eliminated. ""BUGGY"" - G and B, but two G's.

Actually, ""CUPPY"" seems to be the closest valid word with U, P, Y and one additional letter C. Let's check if C is allowed - yes, C hasn't been eliminated.

But ""CUPPY"" has two P's, which might not be the most efficient. Let's see if there's another word.

""GUPPY"" - G, U, P, P, Y. This has two P's as well.

""KUPPY"" - K, U, P, P, Y. This seems similar.

""VUPPY"" - V, U, P, P, Y.

""JUPPY"" - J, U, P, P, Y.

""BUPPY"" - B, U, P, P, Y.

""ZUPPY"" - Z, U, P, P, Y.

These all seem similar. Let's try ""CUPPY"" as it's a valid word.

But wait, let's think of other words with U, P, Y. Maybe ""UPPY?"" - but we need two more letters.

""UPPY?"" - but we need 5 letters. Maybe ""UPPY?"" is not valid.

Another approach: ""JUPY?"" - but we need a 5-letter word. Maybe ""JUPPY"" is the closest.

Given the constraints, ""CUPPY"" seems to be the most plausible word that includes U, P, Y and one additional letter C.

But let's double-check: C, U, P, P, Y - all letters are allowed (C, U, P, Y are not eliminated), and it's a valid 5-letter word.

So I'll go with CUPPY.Based on the feedback, the word must contain U, P, and Y (since they were marked “-” in previous guesses), and cannot contain any of the letters already ruled out (A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M). The remaining letters that haven’t been tested yet are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

A valid 5-letter word that uses U, P, Y and two of these remaining letters is “CUPPY” (C, U, P, P, Y). It includes the required letters and only uses allowed letters.

B, F, G, H, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that uses U, P, Y plus two of those remaining letters.  
Scanning possibilities:

- B, F, G, H, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Valid words that fit:  
- BUMPY – M eliminated  
- FUGLY – L eliminated  
- HUMPY – M eliminated  
- VUGGY – G twice, but G still allowed  
- BUGGY – same  
- KUPPY – P already known once, but word would have two P’s (invalid)  
- JUPPY – J eliminated  
- CUPPY – C eliminated  

The only remaining single-occurrence valid word that satisfies all constraints is:

V, U, G, G, Y → VUGGY (even though G repeats, it’s the only valid 5-letter word left that includes U, P, Y with current allowed letters).  
However, VUGGY contains G twice, and we have no information about G yet.  

Another candidate: B, U, G, G, Y → B U G G Y, but M is eliminated (no, M is separate).  
Actually, BUGGY is valid (B, U, G, G, Y) and all letters are allowed.  

Let’s choose BUGGY.

It uses U, Y and two G’s, but since G hasn’t been tested and we have no repeats yet, it’s acceptable.

But wait – the word must be exactly 5 letters and valid.  
Let’s list all valid English words with U, P, Y and two other unused letters:

- B U G G Y  
- F U G G Y (not a word)  
- H U G G Y (not standard)  
- V U G G Y (not standard)  

BUGGY is the only standard 5-letter word left that fits.

So the next guess is BUGGY.

<guess>BUGGY</guess>",BUGGY,"We now know:

Letters eliminated (x):  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M, C, J

Letters confirmed to be in the word (-):  
U, P, Y (each has appeared in every guess so far and been marked “-”)

Therefore the secret word must contain U, P, and Y exactly once each, and two additional letters that have never been tried.
