For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It has no repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which vowels and consonants are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- Has 3 other letters yet to be discovered

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E
2. Excludes A, R, O
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""STEIN"" - but R is excluded and A,O are excluded, but this has S in position 1 and E in position 2. However, it has N and I which are good letters.
- ""SLEET"" - but has E in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""STEEP"" - but has E in position 5 and 4, which is excluded.
- ""SHEET"" - same issue with E in position 5.
- ""STEAK"" - but has A which is excluded.
- ""STEIN"" seems better - S, T, E, I, N. No A, R, O. S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- ""STINE"" - but E is in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""STEPS"" - has S in position 4 which is excluded.
- ""STEWS"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""SITES"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""SIXTH"" - has X which is less common, but S in position 1, E not present.
- ""SIFTY"" - but Y is less common.
- ""SINUS"" - has S in position 5 and 4 which is excluded.
- ""SLEEP"" - has E in position 5 which is excluded.

- ""SHEET"" - E in position 5 excluded.

Let's update what we know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O are not in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (STEIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E as its third letter.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combining these facts:
- E is locked in position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, I, N (but none of these can be in their previously tried positions)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _ with the remaining letters coming from {S, I, N} plus any other unused letters (excluding the forbidden ones).

Possible positions for S, I, N:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- I cannot be in position 4.
- N cannot be in position 5.

Let's map possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from guess 2), cannot be A/R/O/T (already excluded). Possible: I, N, S (but S is excluded from 1), so I or N.
- Position 2: no restrictions from current info except avoiding A/R/O/T. Could be S, I, N, etc.
- Position 4: cannot be S or E. Could be I or N.
- Position 5: cannot be N or E. Could be S, I, but S is not in position 5 (from guess 1), so I is possible here, but we'd have to check.

Let's think of valid permutations:
We have to place S, I, N in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with the above restrictions.

One straightforward arrangement:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E (fixed)
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: S (but S can't be in position 5, from guess 1)

That fails. Try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: S (again fails)

Try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N (N can't be in 5)

Try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: must be from remaining letters, but we've used I, N, S, E. Available letters could be other consonants not excluded (like D, L, C, etc.), but we have to use only S, I, N plus any other allowed letters.

Wait, we might need to introduce new letters. Let's think differently: the word has E in position 3, and must contain S, I, N somewhere else, avoiding their forbidden positions.

Possible word structure: [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other] E [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other]

Let's try placing N in position 1, S in position 2, I in position 4, and need a fifth letter that is not forbidden. But we've already used N, S, I, E. The fifth letter must be from remaining allowed letters (like D, L, C, etc.), but we don't have info on them yet.

Alternatively, maybe the word is N E S I D or similar, but E must be in position 3.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with E in position 3, containing S, I, N, and avoiding A, R, O, T.

Possible candidates:
- N E S I D (but D is allowed)
- I N E S T (but T is excluded)
- S I N E D (but D is allowed)
- S N I E D (but D is allowed)

Let's check ""SINED"" - but this isn't a valid English word.
""SINED"" is not recognized.

""SNIDE"" - this is a valid word meaning to criticize subtly. Let's check:
- S: position 1 (allowed, since S can't be in 1 from guess 2? Wait, guess 2 says S is not in position 1. So S can't be in 1.)

""SNIDE"" has S in 1 - which is invalid.

""INSED"" - not valid.

""INEDS"" - not valid.

""NIESS"" - has S twice, but we don't know about duplicates.

""INEPT"" - T excluded.

""INEST"" - T excluded.

""INSET"" - T excluded.

""INUES"" - not common.

""ENISD"" - not valid.

This suggests we might need to introduce a new letter. Let's try ""D"" as a new allowed letter.

Consider ""DINSE"" - but E must be in position 3.

Wait, E is fixed in position 3, so word is _ _ E _ _

We need to place S, I, N in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:
- S not in 1 or 4
- I not in 4
- N not in 5

Possible placements:
- S can be in 2 or 5
- I can be in 1, 2, 5
- N can be in 1, 2, 4

Let's try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: needs another letter not forbidden. We've used I, S, E, N. Available letters could be D, L, C, etc. ""INEND"" - not valid.
""INSEN"" - not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: D (new letter)
This gives ""NSEID"" - not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: D
This gives ""NISED"" - not valid.

Try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: D
This gives ""INESD"" - not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""SNIDE"" but S can't be in 1. So this is invalid.

Alternative: maybe the word is ""ENISD"" - but E is in 3, so this doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think differently: maybe the word has E in 3, and uses S, I, N plus one other letter not yet tested. The other letter could be ""L"" or ""D"" or ""C"".

Consider ""LINED"" - but this has L, I, N, E, D. E is in 3, which fits. Does it contain S? No, but we know S must be in the word. So this is invalid.

""LINER"" - R excluded.

""LINSE"" - not valid.

""LINUS"" - S in 5, which is allowed (S can't be in 4 or 5? Wait, guess 1 says S is not in 4, but can be in 5. Guess 2 says S is not in 1. So S can be in 2, 3, 5. But 3 is E, so 2 or 5.

""LINUS"" has S in 5 - possible.

Check if ""LINUS"" fits all constraints:
- E is in 3: yes (it's _ _ E _ _)
- Contains S, I, N: yes (I in 2, N in 4, S in 5)
- No A, R, O, T: yes
- S not in 1 or 4: yes (it's in 5)
- I not in 4: yes (it's in 2)
- N not in 5: yes (it's in 4)

This seems valid. ""LINUS"" is a recognized 5-letter word.

Thus, the next guess should be LINUS.
</think>

Based on the accumulated constraints:
- E is locked in position 3
- Must contain S, I, N placed in allowed positions
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T
- Allowed positions: S not 1/4, I not 4, N not 5

A valid candidate that satisfies all these is ""LINUS"".

<guess>LINUS</guess>",LINUS,"Let's update what we know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R, O are not in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (STEIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E as its third letter.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combining these facts:
- E is locked in position 3: _ _ E _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, I, N (but none of these can be in their previously tried positions)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T

So the word looks like: _ _ E _ _ with the remaining letters coming from {S, I, N} plus any other unused letters (excluding the forbidden ones).

Possible positions for S, I, N:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 and 2).
- I cannot be in position 4.
- N cannot be in position 5.

Let's map possible positions:
- Position 1: cannot be S (from guess 2), cannot be A/R/O/T (already excluded). Possible: I, N, S (but S is excluded from 1), so I or N.
- Position 2: no restrictions from current info except avoiding A/R/O/T. Could be S, I, N, etc.
- Position 4: cannot be S or E. Could be I or N.
- Position 5: cannot be N or E. Could be S, I, but S is not in position 5 (from guess 1), so I is possible here, but we'd have to check.

Let's think of valid permutations:
We have to place S, I, N in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with the above restrictions.

One straightforward arrangement:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E (fixed)
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: S (but S can't be in position 5, from guess 1)

That fails. Try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: S (again fails)

Try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N (N can't be in 5)

Try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: must be from remaining letters, but we've used I, N, S, E. Available letters could be other consonants not excluded (like D, L, C, etc.), but we have to use only S, I, N plus any other allowed letters.

Wait, we might need to introduce new letters. Let's think differently: the word has E in position 3, and must contain S, I, N somewhere else, avoiding their forbidden positions.

Possible word structure: [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other] E [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other]

Let's try placing N in position 1, S in position 2, I in position 4, and need a fifth letter that is not forbidden. But we've already used N, S, I, E. The fifth letter must be from remaining allowed letters (like D, L, C, etc.), but we don't have info on them yet.

Alternatively, maybe the word is N E S I D or similar, but E must be in position 3.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with E in position 3, containing S, I, N, and avoiding A, R, O, T.

Possible candidates:
- N E S I D (but D is allowed)
- I N E S T (but T is excluded)
- S I N E D (but D is allowed)
- S N I E D (but D is allowed)

Let's check ""SINED"" - but this isn't a valid English word.
""SINED"" is not recognized.

""SNIDE"" - this is a valid word meaning to criticize subtly. Let's check:
- S: position 1 (allowed, since S can't be in 1 from guess 2? Wait, guess 2 says S is not in position 1. So S can't be in 1.)

""SNIDE"" has S in 1 - which is invalid.

""INSED"" - not valid.

""INEDS"" - not valid.

""NIESS"" - has S twice, but we don't know about duplicates.

""INEPT"" - T excluded.

""INEST"" - T excluded.

""LINUS"" - S in 5, which is allowed (S can't be in 4 or 5? Wait, guess 1 says S is not in 4, but can be in 5. Guess 2 says S is not in 1. So S can be in 2, 3, 5. But 3 is E, so 2 or 5.

""LINUS"" has S in 5 - possible.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters
- It has no repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which vowels and consonants are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- Has 3 other letters yet to be discovered

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E
2. Excludes A, R, O
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- ""STEIN"" - but R is excluded and A,O are excluded, but this has S in position 1 and E in position 2. However, it has N and I which are good letters.
- ""SLEET"" - but has E in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""STEEP"" - but has E in position 5 and 4, which is excluded.
- ""SHEET"" - same issue with E in position 5.
- ""STEAK"" - but has A which is excluded.
- ""STEIN"" seems better - S, T, E, I, N. No A, R, O. S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).
- ""STINE"" - but E is in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""STEPS"" - has S in position 4 which is excluded.
- ""STEWS"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""SITES"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""SIXTH"" - has X which is less common, but S in position 1, E not present.
- ""SIFTY"" - but Y is less common.
- ""SINUS"" - has S in position 5 and 4 which is excluded.
- ""SLEEP"" - has E in position 5 which is excluded.
- ""SLEPT"" - has E in position 4 which is excluded.
- ""SLEET"" - E in position 5 excluded.
- ""SHEET"" - E in position 5 excluded.
- ""STEEL"" - E in position 5 excluded.
- ""STEAK"" - A excluded.
- ""STEIN"" seems the best so far.

Another option: ""STEIN"" - S, T, E, I, N. No A, R, O. S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5). Uses common letters T, I, N.

Alternatively: ""STEIN"" is good, but let me think of another - ""STEIN"" is actually a good choice. 

Another possible: ""STEIN"" is the best among these. Let me go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback that S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and A, R, O are not in the word, I'll try a new guess that includes S and E while avoiding A, R, O.

S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5).\n- ""STINE"" - but E is in position 5 which is excluded.\n- ""STEPS"" - has S in position 4 which is excluded.\n- ""STEWS"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.\n- ""SITES"" - has S in position 5 which is excluded.\n- ""SIXTH"" - has X which is less common, but S in position 1, E not present.\n- ""SIFTY"" - but Y is less common.\n- ""SINUS"" - has S in position 5 and 4 which is excluded.\n- ""SLEEP"" - has E in position 5 which is excluded.\n- ""SLEPT"" - has E in position 4 which is excluded.\n- ""SLEET"" - E in position 5 excluded.\n- ""SHEET"" - E in position 5 excluded.\n- ""STEEL"" - E in position 5 excluded.\n- ""STEAK"" - A excluded.\n- ""STEIN"" seems the best so far.\n\nAnother option: ""STEIN"" - S, T, E, I, N. No A, R, O. S is in position 1 (not 4), E is in position 3 (not 5). Uses common letters T, I, N.\n\nAlternatively: ""STEIN"" is good, but let me think of another - ""STEIN"" is actually a good choice. \n\nAnother possible: ""STEIN"" is the best among these. Let me go with ""STEIN"".Based on the feedback that S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions, and A, R, O are not in the word, I\'ll try a new guess that includes S and E while avoiding A, R, O.\n\n<guess>STEIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let\'s update what we know after two guesses.\n\nFrom Guess 1 (AROSE):\n- A, R, O are not in the word.\n- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.\n- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (STEIN):\n- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.\n- T is not in the word.\n- E is in position 3 (✓), so the word has E as its third letter.\n- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.\n- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.\n\nCombining these facts:\n- E is locked in position 3: _ _ E _ _\n- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, I, N (but none of these can be in their previously tried positions)\n- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T\n\nSo the word looks like: _ _ E _ _ with the remaining letters coming from {S, I, N} plus any other unused letters (excluding the forbidden ones).\n\nPossible positions for S, I, N:\n- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from guesses 1 and 2).\n- I cannot be in position 4.\n- N cannot be in position 5.\n\nLet\'s map possible positions:\n- Position 1: cannot be S (from guess 2), cannot be A/R/O/T (already excluded). Possible: I, N, S (but S is excluded from 1), so I or N.\n- Position 2: no restrictions from current info except avoiding A/R/O/T. Could be S, I, N, etc.\n- Position 4: cannot be S or E. Could be I or N.\n- Position 5: cannot be N or E. Could be S, I, but S is not in position 5 (from guess 1), so I is possible here, but we\'d have to check.\n\nLet\'s think of valid permutations:\nWe have to place S, I, N in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with the above restrictions.\n\nOne straightforward arrangement:\n- Position 1: I\n- Position 2: S\n- Position 3: E (fixed)\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: S (but S can\'t be in position 5, from guess 1)\n\nThat fails.

Available letters could be other consonants not excluded (like D, L, C, etc.), but we have to use only S, I, N plus any other allowed letters.\n\nWait, we might need to introduce new letters. Let\'s think differently: the word has E in position 3, and must contain S, I, N somewhere else, avoiding their forbidden positions.\n\nPossible word structure: [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other] E [S/I/N or other] [S/I/N or other]\n\nLet\'s try placing N in position 1, S in position 2, I in position 4, and need a fifth letter that is not forbidden. But we\'ve already used N, S, I, E. The fifth letter must be from remaining allowed letters (like D, L, C, etc.), but we don\'t have info on them yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is N E S I D or similar, but E must be in position 3.\n\nAnother approach: list all 5-letter words with E in position 3, containing S, I, N, and avoiding A, R, O, T.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- N E S I D (but D is allowed)\n- I N E S T (but T is excluded)\n- S I N E D (but D is allowed)\n- S N I E D (but D is allowed)\n\nLet\'s check ""SINED"" - but this isn\'t a valid English word.\n""SINED"" is not recognized.\n\n""SNIDE"" - this is a valid word meaning to criticize subtly. Let\'s check:\n- S: position 1 (allowed, since S can\'t be in 1 from guess 2? Wait, guess 2 says S is not in position 1. So S can\'t be in 1.)\n\n""SNIDE"" has S in 1 - which is invalid.\n\n""INSED"" - not valid.\n\n""INEDS"" - not valid.\n\n""NIESS"" - has S twice, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n""INEPT"" - T excluded.\n\n""INEST"" - T excluded.\n\n""INSET"" - T excluded.\n\n""INUES"" - not common.\n\n""ENISD"" - not valid.\n\nThis suggests we might need to introduce a new letter. Let\'s try ""D"" as a new allowed letter.\n\nConsider ""DINSE"" - but E must be in position 3.\n\nWait, E is fixed in position 3, so word is _ _ E _ _\n\nWe need to place S, I, N in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with:\n- S not in 1 or 4\n- I not in 4\n- N not in 5\n\nPossible placements:\n- S can be in 2 or 5\n- I can be in 1, 2, 5\n- N can be in 1, 2, 4\n\nLet\'s try:\n- Position 1: I\n- Position 2: S\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: needs another letter not forbidden. We\'ve used I, S, E, N. Available letters could be D, L, C, etc. ""INEND"" - not valid.\n""INSEN"" - not valid.\n\nTry:\n- Position 1: N\n- Position 2: S\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: D (new letter)\nThis gives ""NSEID"" - not valid.\n\nTry:\n- Position 1: N\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: D\nThis gives ""NISED"" - not valid.\n\nTry:\n- Position 1: I\n- Position 2: N\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: D\nThis gives ""INESD"" - not valid.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the word is ""SNIDE"" but S can\'t be in 1. So this is invalid.\n\nAlternative: maybe the word is ""ENISD"" - but E is in 3, so this doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, let\'s think differently: maybe the word has E in 3, and uses S, I, N plus one other letter not yet tested. The other letter could be ""L"" or ""D"" or ""C"".\n\nConsider ""LINED"" - but this has L, I, N, E, D. E is in 3, which fits. Does it contain S? No, but we know S must be in the word. So this is invalid.\n\n""LINER"" - R excluded.\n\n""LINSE"" - not valid.\n\n""LINUS"" - S in 5, which is allowed (S can\'t be in 4 or 5? Wait, guess 1 says S is not in 4, but can be in 5. Guess 2 says S is not in 1. So S can be in 2, 3, 5. But 3 is E, so 2 or 5.\n\n""LINUS"" has S in 5 - possible.\n\nCheck if ""LINUS"" fits all constraints:\n- E is in 3: yes (it\'s _ _ E _ _)\n- Contains S, I, N: yes (I in 2, N in 4, S in 5)\n- No A, R, O, T: yes\n- S not in 1 or 4: yes (it\'s in 5)\n- I not in 4: yes (it\'s in 2)\n- N not in 5: yes (it\'s in 4)\n\nThis seems valid. ""LINUS"" is a recognized 5-letter word.\n\nThus, the next guess should be LINUS.Based on the accumulated constraints:\n- E is locked in position 3\n- Must contain S, I, N placed in allowed positions\n- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T\n- Allowed positions: S not 1/4, I not 4, N not 5\n\nA valid candidate that satisfies all these is ""LINUS"".\n\n<guess>LINUS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)\nGuess 3: LINUS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) N(-) U(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts
- E is fixed in position 3: _ _ E _ _
- L is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- S is in the word and in position 5 (✓)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, T, U

So the word must look like: L I E _ S
and it must contain an N somewhere in positions 3 or 4, but position 3 is already E, so N must be in position 4.

Therefore the only possible pattern is: L I E N S

Check constraints:
- L in 1: ✓
- I in 2: ✓
- E in 3: ✓
- N in 4: allowed (only forbidden in 5)
- S in 5: ✓
- No forbidden letters appear.
