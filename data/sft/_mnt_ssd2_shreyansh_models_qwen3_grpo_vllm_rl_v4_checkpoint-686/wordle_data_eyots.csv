For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _ with the letters S and E somewhere else in the word, and A and R excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S and E in different positions (not 4 and 5 respectively, since those were their positions in AROSE).
3. Avoids A and R entirely.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- E is now in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- S is now in position 4 (was in 4 before, but since it was marked wrong-position, I need to move it elsewhere). Wait, S was in position 4 and marked (-), so it can't be in position 4 again. Let me adjust.

Better candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S is now in position 1 (new position).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- E is now in position 5 (was in 5 before, but that's the same position - bad).

Another candidate: ""SLOPE""
- S in position 1 (new).
- L and P new.
- O in 3 (correct).
- E in 5 (was in 5 - same position, bad).

Better: ""SNOPE"" – but S in 1, O in 3, E in 5 (still E in 5 which was same as before).

Alternative: ""STONE""
- S in 1 (new), T new, O in 3, N new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

Better: ""STONE"" has E in 5 same as AROSE, so no.

Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - E is in 5 same as before, so no.

Alternative: ""SPOKE"" has E in 5 same as before - no.

Better approach: move E away from position 5. Let's try ""POSED"":
- P, D new.
- E in 2 (was in 5).
- S in 4 (was in 4 - same, bad).

""POSED"" has S in 4 same as before - no.

""POSED"" is invalid because S was in 4 marked (-), so can't be in 4.

Let's try ""SPOKE"" - E in 5 same as before - no.

""SCOPE"":

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (from AROSE).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere else), E (somewhere else).
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, B, and also not in positions 4 or 5 for S and E respectively (because those were marked “wrong position”).

So:
- O is locked in position 3.
- S and E must appear elsewhere in the word, but:
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOBER), so S must be in position 2 or 5.
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 4 (from SOBER), so E must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need to introduce new consonants that haven’t been tried yet (common ones left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses fresh letters is “STONE”:
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- T is new.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- N is new.
- E in position 5 (but E was already shown to be excluded from position 5 in AROSE) → invalid.

Next candidate: “NOTES”:
- N, T new.
- O in 3.
- E in 5 (invalid).

“TENSE”:
- T new.
- E in 2 (allowed).
- N new.
- S in 4 (invalid, S cannot be in 4).

“POSED”:

- E in 4 (allowed).

This uses:

- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _ with the letters S and E somewhere else in the word, and A and R excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S and E in different positions (not 4 and 5 respectively, since those were their positions in AROSE).
3. Avoids A and R entirely.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- E is now in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- S is now in position 4 (was in 4 before, but since it was marked wrong-position, I need to move it elsewhere). Wait, S was in position 4 and marked (-), so it can't be in position 4 again. Let me adjust.

Better candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S is now in position 1 (new position).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- E is now in position 5 (was in 5 before, but that's the same position - bad).

Another candidate: ""SLOPE""
- S in position 1 (new).
- L and P new.
- O in 3 (correct).
- E in 5 (was in 5 - same position, bad).

Better: ""SNOPE"" – but S in 1, O in 3, E in 5 (still E in 5 which was same as before).

Alternative: ""STONE""
- S in 1 (new), T new, O in 3, N new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

Better: ""STONE"" has E in 5 same as AROSE, so no.

Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - E is in 5 same as before, so no.

Alternative: ""SPOKE"" has E in 5 same as before - no.

Better approach: move E away from position 5. Let's try ""POSED"":
- P, D new.
- E in 2 (was in 5).
- S in 4 (was in 4 - same, bad).

""POSED"" has S in 4 same as before - no.

""POSED"" is invalid because S was in 4 marked (-), so can't be in 4.

Let's try ""SPOKE"" - E in 5 same as before - no.

""SCOPE"":
- S in 1 (new), C new, O in 3, P new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

""SOBER"":
- S in 1 (new), O in 3, B new, E in 4 (new position), R is excluded (from AROSE).

""SOBER"" uses B and E in new positions, avoids A/R, keeps O in 3, moves E from 5 to 4, and S from 4 to 1.

This seems good.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (from AROSE).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere else), E (somewhere else).
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, B, and also not in positions 4 or 5 for S and E respectively (because those were marked “wrong position”).

So:
- O is locked in position 3.
- S and E must appear elsewhere in the word, but:
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOBER), so S must be in position 2 or 5.
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 4 (from SOBER), so E must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need to introduce new consonants that haven’t been tried yet (common ones left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses fresh letters is “STONE”:
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- T is new.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- N is new.
- E in position 5 (but E was already shown to be excluded from position 5 in AROSE) → invalid.

Next candidate: “NOTES”:
- N, T new.
- O in 3.
- E in 5 (invalid).

“TENSE”:
- T new.
- E in 2 (allowed).
- N new.
- S in 4 (invalid, S cannot be in 4).

“POSED”:
- P new.
- O in 3.
- S in 2 (allowed).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- D new.

This uses:
- S in 2 (allowed).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- All new letters P and D.
- Keeps O in 3.

Looks good.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _ with the letters S and E somewhere else in the word, and A and R excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S and E in different positions (not 4 and 5 respectively, since those were their positions in AROSE).
3. Avoids A and R entirely.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- E is now in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- S is now in position 4 (was in 4 before, but since it was marked wrong-position, I need to move it elsewhere). Wait, S was in position 4 and marked (-), so it can't be in position 4 again. Let me adjust.

Better candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S is now in position 1 (new position).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- E is now in position 5 (was in 5 before, but that's the same position - bad).

Another candidate: ""SLOPE""
- S in position 1 (new).
- L and P new.
- O in 3 (correct).
- E in 5 (was in 5 - same position, bad).

Better: ""SNOPE"" – but S in 1, O in 3, E in 5 (still E in 5 which was same as before).

Alternative: ""STONE""
- S in 1 (new), T new, O in 3, N new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

Better: ""STONE"" has E in 5 same as AROSE, so no.

Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - E is in 5 same as before, so no.

Alternative: ""SPOKE"" has E in 5 same as before - no.

Better approach: move E away from position 5. Let's try ""POSED"":
- P, D new.
- E in 2 (was in 5).
- S in 4 (was in 4 - same, bad).

""POSED"" has S in 4 same as before - no.

""POSED"" is invalid because S was in 4 marked (-), so can't be in 4.

Let's try ""SPOKE"" - E in 5 same as before - no.

""SCOPE"":
- S in 1 (new), C new, O in 3, P new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

""SOBER"":
- S in 1 (new), O in 3, B new, E in 4 (new position), R is excluded (from AROSE).

""SOBER"" uses B and E in new positions, avoids A/R, keeps O in 3, moves E from 5 to 4, and S from 4 to 1.

From the latest feedback:

1. Pattern so far: E _ O _ S  
   (E is in position 1, O in position 3, S in position 5.)

2. T is in the word but not in position 2 (from ETHOS feedback: T(-)).

3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, B, P, D, H.

4. Positions still open: 2 and 4.

5. T must go in either position 2 or 4.  
   - If T is in position 2: E T O _ S → need a letter for position 4.  
   - If T is in position 4: E _ O T S → need a letter for position 2.

Common remaining consonants (not yet eliminated): N, L, C, G, M, K, etc.

Candidate words:
- E T O N S → “ETONS” (valid English word? No, not common)
- E N O T S → “ENOTS” (not a word)
- E T O G S → “ETOGS” (no)
- E C O T S → “E COTS” (no)
- E N O T S → same as above
- E L O T S → “ELOTS” (no)
- E M O T S → “EMOTS” (no)
- E G O T S → “EGOTS” (no)
- E N O T S → no
- E N O T S → no
- E N O T S → no

Wait, let’s list real 5-letter words fitting E _ O _ S or E _ O T S:

- E T O N S → not a word
- E N O T S → not a word
- E L O T S → not a word
- E C O T S → not a word
- E M O T S → not a word
- E G O T S → not a word
- E N O T S → not a word
- E N O T S → not a word
- E N O T S → not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let me double-check the constraints:

Pattern: E _ O _ S  
Letters used so far: E, O, S (correct), T (somewhere), and we need two more letters not yet eliminated.

Wait, the only remaining letter we haven’t used is N, L, C, G, M, K, etc.

Let me try “E N O T S” → “ENOTS” – not valid.

“E L O T S” → “ELOTS” – not valid.

“E C O T S” → “ECOTS” – not valid.

“E G O T S” → “EGOTS” – not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word has an O in the 3rd position.
- S and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ O _ _ with the letters S and E somewhere else in the word, and A and R excluded.

I need a new word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Uses S and E in different positions (not 4 and 5 respectively, since those were their positions in AROSE).
3. Avoids A and R entirely.

A good candidate is ""POSED"":
- P and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- E is now in position 2 (was in 5 before).
- S is now in position 4 (was in 4 before, but since it was marked wrong-position, I need to move it elsewhere). Wait, S was in position 4 and marked (-), so it can't be in position 4 again. Let me adjust.

Better candidate: ""SPOKE""
- S is now in position 1 (new position).
- P and K are new letters.
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- E is now in position 5 (was in 5 before, but that's the same position - bad).

Another candidate: ""SLOPE""
- S in position 1 (new).
- L and P new.
- O in 3 (correct).
- E in 5 (was in 5 - same position, bad).

Better: ""SNOPE"" – but S in 1, O in 3, E in 5 (still E in 5 which was same as before).

Alternative: ""STONE""
- S in 1 (new), T new, O in 3, N new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

Better: ""STONE"" has E in 5 same as AROSE, so no.

Let's try ""SLOPE"" again - E is in 5 same as before, so no.

Alternative: ""SPOKE"" has E in 5 same as before - no.

Better approach: move E away from position 5. Let's try ""POSED"":
- P, D new.
- E in 2 (was in 5).
- S in 4 (was in 4 - same, bad).

""POSED"" has S in 4 same as before - no.

""POSED"" is invalid because S was in 4 marked (-), so can't be in 4.

Let's try ""SPOKE"" - E in 5 same as before - no.

""SCOPE"":
- S in 1 (new), C new, O in 3, P new, E in 5 (same as before - bad).

""SOBER"":
- S in 1 (new), O in 3, B new, E in 4 (new position), R is excluded (from AROSE).

""SOBER"" uses B and E in new positions, avoids A/R, keeps O in 3, moves E from 5 to 4, and S from 4 to 1.

This seems good.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SOBER -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(-) B(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (from AROSE).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: O (position 3), S (somewhere else), E (somewhere else).
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, B, and also not in positions 4 or 5 for S and E respectively (because those were marked “wrong position”).

So:
- O is locked in position 3.
- S and E must appear elsewhere in the word, but:
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from SOBER), so S must be in position 2 or 5.
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 4 (from SOBER), so E must be in position 1 or 2.

We also need to introduce new consonants that haven’t been tried yet (common ones left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses fresh letters is “STONE”:
- S in position 2 (allowed).
- T is new.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- N is new.
- E in position 5 (but E was already shown to be excluded from position 5 in AROSE) → invalid.

Next candidate: “NOTES”:
- N, T new.
- O in 3.
- E in 5 (invalid).

“TENSE”:
- T new.
- E in 2 (allowed).
- N new.
- S in 4 (invalid, S cannot be in 4).

“POSED”:
- P new.
- O in 3.
- S in 2 (allowed).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- D new.

This uses:
- S in 2 (allowed).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- All new letters P and D.
- Keeps O in 3.

Looks good.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (O is in position 3).
2. Letters that are definitely in the word: O (position 3), S, E.
3. Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: A, R, B, P, D.
4. Position restrictions:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SOBER and POSED).
   - E cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5 (from SOBER and POSED).

Therefore:
- S can only be in position 5.
- E can only be in position 1.

So the pattern must be: E _ O _ S.

We need two new consonants for positions 2 and 4, chosen from letters not yet eliminated (common remaining: T, N, L, C, G, etc.).

A valid word fitting E _ O _ S is “ETHOS”:
- E in 1 (allowed).
- T new.
- O in 3 (correct).
- H new.
- S in 5 (allowed).

All letters are fresh except O and S, which are confirmed in the word.

From the feedback so far we have:

1. Pattern: E _ O _ S  (positions 1, 3, 5 are fixed)
2. T is in the word but not in position 2 (from ETHOS feedback: T(-))
3. H is not in the word at all (from ETHOS feedback: H(x))
4. The remaining letters for positions 2 and 4 must be chosen from unused letters (not A, R, B, P, D, H).

Common unused consonants left: N, L, C, G, etc.

We need a word that:
- Starts with E, has O in position 3, and S in position 5.
- Has T somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (but not in position 2 from ETHOS).
- Uses only valid English words.

Possible structure: E T O _ S or E _ O T S.

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- E T O _ S: No common word fits (e.g., ETOS? not valid)
- E _ O T S: The word ""ELOTS"" is not valid, but ""ENOTS"" is also invalid.
- Actually, the only valid word fitting E _ O T S is ""ENOTS"" (but N is allowed).

Wait, let me reconsider. The word must be E _ O _ S with T in position 4 (since it can't be in position 2).

So the pattern is: E _ O T S.

Looking for valid words: ""ELOTS"" is not valid, but ""EVOCS"" is invalid (doesn't fit pattern). 

Actually, the valid word is ""ENOTS"" (but this seems obscure). Let me check again.

The correct word fitting E _ O T S is ""ENOTS"" (but this is not a common word). 

However, ""ELOTS"" is invalid. I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine:

From ETHOS feedback:
- E(✓) - correct in position 1
- T(-) - T is in word but not in position 2
- H(x) - H not in word
- O(-) - O is in word but not in position 4 (but we know O is in position 3 from AROSE)
- S(✓) - correct in position 5

So the pattern is definitely E _ O _ S.

T must be in position 4 (since it can't be in position 2, and positions 1,3,5 are taken).

Thus the word is E _ O T S.

The only valid English word fitting this is ""ENOTS"" (but this is not a standard word). 

Wait, I think I missed ""ELOTS"" is invalid, but ""EVOCS"" doesn't fit. 

Actually, the correct word is ""ENOTS"" (but this is not in standard dictionaries). 

I must have missed a word. Let me think again:

Valid words fitting E _ O _ S:
- ELOWS (but W is untested)
- ELOPS (but P is excluded from position 4)
- ELOMS (but M is untested)

Actually, the correct word is ""ELOWS"" (but this is obscure). 

I think the intended word is ""ENOTS"" but it's not valid. 

Wait, let me check ""ELOWS"" - this is a valid word (slang for elves). 

But let's see if it fits:
- E(✓) - correct
- L - new
- O(✓) - correct
- W - new
- S(✓) - correct

This fits all constraints: E L O W S.

Thus, the next guess should be ""ELOWS"".
