2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""RAISE"" or ""STARE"", but I'll go with AROSE as it covers slightly different letters (O vs I, S vs T).

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the secret word contains an S, but NOT in the 4th position.  
I now need a new word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters still available (excluding A, R, O, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word with S plus other high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., T, I, N, L, C, etc.). A good candidate is “STING”:
- S is moved to position 1 (safe, since it can’t be in position 4).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not ruled out yet.

Other possibilities: “SLING”, “SPURN”, “STUNT”, but “STING” feels most balanced.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""RAISE"" or ""STARE"", but I'll go with AROSE as it covers slightly different letters (O vs I, S vs T).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the secret word contains an S, but NOT in the 4th position.  
I now need a new word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Letters still available (excluding A, R, O, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I’ll look for a word with S plus other high-frequency remaining letters (e.g., T, I, N, L, C, etc.). A good candidate is “STING”:
- S is moved to position 1 (safe, since it can’t be in position 4).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not ruled out yet.

Other possibilities: “SLING”, “SPURN”, “STUNT”, but “STING” feels most balanced.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.
- The letter S is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 4 (because in AROSE it was in position 4 and marked “-”, and in STING it was in position 1 and also marked “-”).  
Therefore S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S exactly once.
2. S is in position 2, 3, or 5.
3. Uses only letters that have NOT been eliminated: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that places S in position 3 (middle) and uses other common remaining consonants and vowels.  
A good candidate is “BUSHY”:
- B, U, H, Y are all still possible.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters are used.

Another option could be “CLASH” (but H is allowed, L is allowed, etc.), but let’s go with “BUSHY” for variety.

From the latest feedback:

- C is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- U is in position 2 (✓) – already known
- P is NOT in the word (x)
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- S is in position 5 (✓) – now locked

So the word must be of the form: _ U _ _ S  
with the constraints:
- C must appear somewhere (not position 1)
- Y must appear somewhere (not position 4)
- No A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, B, H, P are allowed
- Allowed letters left: C, D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, Y, plus S, U already placed

Possible positions for C and Y:
- C can be in positions 3 or 4
- Y can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4 if C is there)

Let’s list valid combinations:

1. If C is in position 3: _ U C _ S  
   Then Y must be in position 1 or 4  
   - Position 1: Y → Y U C _ S → need a valid 4th letter from remaining (D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)  
     Valid word: Y U C L S → ""YUCLS"" – not a real word  
     Y U C K S → ""YUCKS"" – valid  
   - Position 4: Y → _ U C Y S → need a valid 1st letter → ""DUCYS"", ""FUCYS"", etc. – none are words

2. If C is in position 4: _ U _ C S  
   Then Y must be in position 1 or 3  
   - Position 1: Y → Y U _ C S → need a 3rd letter → ""YUDCS"", ""YUFCS"", etc. – none  
   - Position 3: Y → _ U Y C S → need a 1st letter → ""DUCYS"", ""FUCYS"", etc. – none

Wait, let’s check if any valid English word fits _ U _ _ S with C and Y somewhere.

Looking at the constraints, the only plausible word that fits is ""DUCYS"" – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next, ""MUCYS"" – also invalid.

Actually, let’s re-examine the allowed letters and valid word possibilities.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in ""US"" with U in position 2 and S in position 5, containing C and Y, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""DUCYS"" – invalid
- ""FUCYS"" – invalid
- ""JUCYS"" – invalid
- ""LUCYS"" – invalid
- ""MUCYS"" – invalid
- ""VUCYS"" – invalid
- ""WUCYS"" – invalid

Hmm, none seem valid. Let’s reconsider.

Wait, perhaps Y is in position 1 and C in position 3: Y U C _ S  
The missing letter (position 4) must be from allowed letters: D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z
