For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and E.
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Has O not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is often one that re-uses the known letters in new positions and introduces other common letters. The word “OCEAN” fits:
- Uses O and E.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) – allowed.
- Introduces C and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, S (A is in the word, but we’re avoiding it).

However, “OCEAN” uses A, which we know is not in the word. So that’s bad.

Next, “OCHER”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – both allowed.
- Introduces C, H, R – but R is excluded.

“OILED”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – allowed.

This looks good.

Wait, let’s use a valid word: ""CONGE"" – but G is allowed, but E is already in position 4.

Better: ""COBEN"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""CONEY"":
- C O N E Y
- C, N, Y are allowed.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (correct).

""CONGE"" is invalid (not a common word).

""CONED"" – D is forbidden.

""COVEN"" – V is allowed, but we don’t know about V yet.

""COVEN"" is valid and uses:
- C, V, N, O, E.
- O in position 2.
- E in position 4.

This seems good.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, S, I, L, D, C, V  
Confirmed letters and positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from COVEN)
- E is in position 4 (✓ from OILED)
So the word looks like: _ O _ E _

Remaining positions 1, 3, 5 must use letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (from the alphabet minus forbidden ones):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

From COVEN we also learned N(-): N is in the word but not in position 5.  
So N must be in position 1 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form:
[N or other] O [N or other] E [N or other]

Trying N in position 1: N O _ E _  
Possible third letters: common ones among available are B, G, H, K, M, P, T  
Trying N O B E _ – no common word.  
N O G E _ – NOGE_? Not valid.  
N O M E _ – NOMES is a valid word (plural of nome).  
Let’s check: N O M E S – but S is forbidden.  
N O M E D – D is forbidden.  
N O M E N – N is allowed in position 5, but N(-) means N is not in position 5.  
So N O M E N is invalid because N appears twice and position 5 N is disallowed.

Trying N in position 3: _ O N E _  
First letter: must be available and not N. Common choices: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T  
B O N E _ – BONE_? BONES is valid but S is forbidden.  
F O N E _ – FONE_? Not common.  
G O N E _ – GONE_? GONER is valid but R is forbidden.  
H O N E _ – HONE_? HONED is valid but D is forbidden.  
K O N E _ – KONE_? Not common.  
M O N E _ – MONEY is valid and uses Y (allowed).  
M O N E Y – letters: M, O, N, E, Y – all allowed, positions fit.

Thus, MONEY is a strong candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and E.
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Has O not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is often one that re-uses the known letters in new positions and introduces other common letters. The word “OCEAN” fits:
- Uses O and E.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) – allowed.
- Introduces C and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, S (A is in the word, but we’re avoiding it).

However, “OCEAN” uses A, which we know is not in the word. So that’s bad.

Next, “OCHER”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – both allowed.
- Introduces C, H, R – but R is excluded.

“OILED”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – allowed.
- Introduces I, L, D – none excluded.

This looks good.

Another option: “VOICE”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (excluded).

So “OILED” is a strong candidate.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S
- Letters in the word but wrong position: O, E

Guess 2: OILED → O(-) I(x) L(x) E(✓) D(x)
- Letters not in the word: I, L, D (in addition to A, R, S)
- Letters in the word: E is correct in position 4.

So far we know:
- E is in position 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, I, L, D.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Position 4 is E.
- O must be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- We need three more letters, none of which are forbidden.

Common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try a word that puts O in position 2 and uses other common letters:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: N

Word: COMEN (but COMEN isn’t valid).
Next option: CONEY (but Y is allowed, but we don’t know about N or Y yet).

Wait, let’s use a valid word: ""CONGE"" – but G is allowed, but E is already in position 4.

Better: ""COBEN"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""CONEY"":
- C O N E Y
- C, N, Y are allowed.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (correct).

""CONGE"" is invalid (not a common word).

""CONED"" – D is forbidden.

""COVEN"" – V is allowed, but we don’t know about V yet.

""COVEN"" is valid and uses:
- C, V, N, O, E.
- O in position 2.
- E in position 4.

This seems good.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and E.
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Has O not in position 3 and E not in position 5.

A good next guess is often one that re-uses the known letters in new positions and introduces other common letters. The word “OCEAN” fits:
- Uses O and E.
- O is in position 1 (not 3) – allowed.
- E is in position 3 (not 5) – allowed.
- Introduces C and N, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, S (A is in the word, but we’re avoiding it).

However, “OCEAN” uses A, which we know is not in the word. So that’s bad.

Next, “OCHER”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – both allowed.
- Introduces C, H, R – but R is excluded.

“OILED”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 1, E in position 4 – allowed.
- Introduces I, L, D – none excluded.

This looks good.

Another option: “VOICE”:
- Uses O and E.
- O in position 2 (allowed), E in position 5 (excluded).

So “OILED” is a strong candidate.

Guess 2: OILED -> FEEDBACK: O(-) I(x) L(x) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S
- Letters in the word but wrong position: O, E

Guess 2: OILED → O(-) I(x) L(x) E(✓) D(x)
- Letters not in the word: I, L, D (in addition to A, R, S)
- Letters in the word: E is correct in position 4.

So far we know:
- E is in position 4.
- O is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, I, L, D.

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Position 4 is E.
- O must be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- We need three more letters, none of which are forbidden.

Common remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try a word that puts O in position 2 and uses other common letters:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: N

Word: COMEN (but COMEN isn’t valid).
Next option: CONEY (but Y is allowed, but we don’t know about N or Y yet).

Wait, let’s use a valid word: ""CONGE"" – but G is allowed, but E is already in position 4.

Better: ""COBEN"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""CONEY"":
- C O N E Y
- C, N, Y are allowed.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (correct).

""CONGE"" is invalid (not a common word).

""CONED"" – D is forbidden.

""COVEN"" – V is allowed, but we don’t know about V yet.

""COVEN"" is valid and uses:
- C, V, N, O, E.
- O in position 2.
- E in position 4.

This seems good.

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Forbidden letters (never appear): A, R, S, I, L, D, C, V  
Confirmed letters and positions:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from COVEN)
- E is in position 4 (✓ from OILED)
So the word looks like: _ O _ E _

Remaining positions 1, 3, 5 must use letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (from the alphabet minus forbidden ones):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

From COVEN we also learned N(-): N is in the word but not in position 5.  
So N must be in position 1 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form:
[N or other] O [N or other] E [N or other]

Trying N in position 1: N O _ E _  
Possible third letters: common ones among available are B, G, H, K, M, P, T  
Trying N O B E _ – no common word.  
N O G E _ – NOGE_? Not valid.  
N O M E _ – NOMES is a valid word (plural of nome).  
Let’s check: N O M E S – but S is forbidden.  
N O M E D – D is forbidden.  
N O M E N – N is allowed in position 5, but N(-) means N is not in position 5.  
So N O M E N is invalid because N appears twice and position 5 N is disallowed.

Trying N in position 3: _ O N E _  
First letter: must be available and not N. Common choices: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, T  
B O N E _ – BONE_? BONES is valid but S is forbidden.  
F O N E _ – FONE_? Not common.  
G O N E _ – GONE_? GONER is valid but R is forbidden.  
H O N E _ – HONE_? HONED is valid but D is forbidden.  
K O N E _ – KONE_? Not common.  
M O N E _ – MONEY is valid and uses Y (allowed).  
M O N E Y – letters: M, O, N, E, Y – all allowed, positions fit.

Thus, MONEY is a strong candidate.

From the feedback on MONEY and HONEY we now know:

- Positions 2-5 are locked: O N E Y  
- Position 1 must be a letter that has NOT yet been ruled out.

Forbidden letters accumulated so far:  
A, R, S, I, L, D, C, V, M, H

That leaves only a few consonants for position 1:  
B, F, G, J, K, P, Q, T, W, X, Z

Scanning the pattern ? O N E Y, the only common English word is:

B O N E Y  →  “BONEY” (archaic or dialectal spelling of “bones” or “boneyard”)

All other possibilities (FONEY, GONEY, etc.) are not valid English words.

Therefore, the secret word must be BONEY.
