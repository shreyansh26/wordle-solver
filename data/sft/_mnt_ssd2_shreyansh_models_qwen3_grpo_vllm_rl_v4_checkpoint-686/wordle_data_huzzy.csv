### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any, to test multiple letters at once. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, which are all very common letters. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I should avoid those letters entirely in my next guess.  
To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word using letters that weren’t tested at all and still cover common, unused letters.  
Good candidates are: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced choice is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y) – it contains four new letters plus the vowel I, which is very common.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
2. UNITY → U is in the word but in the wrong place, Y is in the correct (last) position, and N, I, T are absent.

So far we know:
- The word ends with Y.
- It contains U somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Letters to avoid: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T.

Possible candidates:  
- BULKY (B, U, L, K, Y) – U is in position 2, ends with Y, no excluded letters.  
- DUMPY (D, U, M, P, Y) – U is in position 2, ends with Y, no excluded letters.  
- CUBBY – but double B and ends with Y, but B is allowed.  
- FUDGY – but G and D are allowed, but U is in position 2.

""BULKY"" seems like a good choice because it tests B, L, K, and places U in position 2 (which is allowed since U is in the word but not in position 1).

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ U _ _ Y, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- C U _ _ Y
- D U _ _ Y
- F U _ _ Y
- G U _ _ Y
- H U _ _ Y
- M U _ _ Y
- P U _ _ Y
- V U _ _ Y
- W U _ _ Y

Looking for real words:
- CUPPY – but P is allowed, double P is okay, ends with Y.
- DUPPY – same with D and P.
- FUMPY – not a valid word.
- GULPY – G, U, L, P, Y – but L is already ruled out.
- HUMPY – H, U, M, P, Y – all letters allowed.
- MUMPY – M, U, M, P, Y – valid.
- PUMPY – P, U, M, P, Y – valid.

""HUMPY"" seems like a good choice as it tests H, M, P and fits the pattern perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these common letters without repeating any, to test multiple letters at once. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, which are all very common letters. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I should avoid those letters entirely in my next guess.  
To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word using letters that weren’t tested at all and still cover common, unused letters.  
Good candidates are: I, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, Y, etc.  
A balanced choice is “UNITY” (U, N, I, T, Y) – it contains four new letters plus the vowel I, which is very common.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.
2. UNITY → U is in the word but in the wrong place, Y is in the correct (last) position, and N, I, T are absent.

So far we know:
- The word ends with Y.
- It contains U somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Letters to avoid: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains U (but not in position 1).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:  
- BULKY (B, U, L, K, Y) – U is in position 2, ends with Y, no excluded letters.  
- DUMPY (D, U, M, P, Y) – U is in position 2, ends with Y, no excluded letters.  
- CUBBY – but double B and ends with Y, but B is allowed.  
- FUDGY – but G and D are allowed, but U is in position 2.

""BULKY"" seems like a good choice because it tests B, L, K, and places U in position 2 (which is allowed since U is in the word but not in position 1).

We now know the word must be exactly H U _ _ Y and the only two unknown letters (positions 3 and 4) must be chosen from the letters that have NOT yet been ruled out.  
Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T, B, L, K, M, P, D.  
That leaves a few common consonants: C, F, G, V, W, etc.

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form H U _ _ Y with the blanks filled only from the still-allowed letters.  
Scanning possibilities:

- H U C _ Y → no common word  
- H U F _ Y → HUFFY (valid)  
- H U G _ Y → HUGGY (valid)  
- H U V _ Y → HUV**Y (no)  
- H U W _ Y → HUW**Y (no)

The two remaining valid candidates are HUFFY and HUGGY.  
Between them, HUFFY uses only two different letters (F), so it tests the minimal new information.  
Therefore, I will guess HUFFY next.
