For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, or D. 

Some popular high-information starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T, L), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E: all x, so these letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Let’s look for words that meet these constraints and contain other common letters. Some possibilities:
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) – S is in position 5.
- SHINS (S in position 1 – invalid, since S can’t be first).
- CHINS is valid (S in position 5, no L/A/T/E).
- SHOCK (S in position 1 – invalid).
- CHINS seems good.

Another option is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word). “CHINS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out completely:
L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N, D, O

Letters we know are in the word:
- S – and it is in the correct position (position 5, because the last feedback shows S(✓) in the 5th slot).

Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R – because R(-) in DROSS means R is in the word but not in position 2.

So the word pattern so far:
_ _ _ _ S
with R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R and S.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S that contains R (not in position 2) and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BURKS – but K is allowed, U is allowed, R is allowed, but we need to check if all letters are allowed. B, U, R, K, S – all allowed.
- FURKS – same letters, valid word.
- GURKS – same.
- PURKS – same.
- MURKS – same.
- WARDS – but D is ruled out.
- BURPS – but P is allowed, but no R in this word.
- BURRS – but has two R's, which is allowed, but S is already in position 5.
- BURKS seems valid.

Let's check BURKS:
- B: allowed
- U: allowed
- R: allowed (position 3)
- K: allowed
- S: correct position 5

This fits all constraints.

Another option is ""BURPS"", but it doesn't contain R, so it can't be right.

Another option is ""BURRS"", which has R in positions 3 and 4 – both allowed, but let's see if it's better to try BURKS first.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, or D. 

Some popular high-information starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T, L), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E: all x, so these letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Let’s look for words that meet these constraints and contain other common letters. Some possibilities:
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) – S is in position 5.
- SHINS (S in position 1 – invalid, since S can’t be first).
- CHINS is valid (S in position 5, no L/A/T/E).
- SHOCK (S in position 1 – invalid).
- CHINS seems good.

Another option is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word). “CHINS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with CHINS.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S (and it is in the correct position: position 5)  
3. Therefore the pattern is _ _ _ _ S

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that does not contain any of the letters L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

Let’s look for a valid word that fits _ _ _ _ S and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- BONUS (but N is excluded)  
- DROSS (O, S allowed)  
- GROSS (G, R, O, S allowed)  
- MURDS (M, U, R, D, S allowed)  
- FURDS (F, U, R, D, S allowed)  
- BURDS (B, U, R, D, S allowed)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, or D. 

Some popular high-information starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T, L), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): The letter S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E: all x, so these letters are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but S is NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

Let’s look for words that meet these constraints and contain other common letters. Some possibilities:
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) – S is in position 5.
- SHINS (S in position 1 – invalid, since S can’t be first).
- CHINS is valid (S in position 5, no L/A/T/E).
- SHOCK (S in position 1 – invalid).
- CHINS seems good.

Another option is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word). “CHINS” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with CHINS.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S (and it is in the correct position: position 5)  
3. Therefore the pattern is _ _ _ _ S

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that does not contain any of the letters L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

Let’s look for a valid word that fits _ _ _ _ S and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:  
- BONUS (but N is excluded)  
- DROSS (O, S allowed)  
- GROSS (G, R, O, S allowed)  
- MURDS (M, U, R, D, S allowed)  
- FURDS (F, U, R, D, S allowed)  
- BURDS (B, U, R, D, S allowed)  

“DROSS” is a valid 5-letter word ending in S and uses only allowed letters (D, R, O, S).  
Let’s try DROSS.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out completely:
L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N, D, O

Letters we know are in the word:
- S – and it is in the correct position (position 5, because the last feedback shows S(✓) in the 5th slot).

Letters we know are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R – because R(-) in DROSS means R is in the word but not in position 2.

So the word pattern so far:
_ _ _ _ S
with R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus R and S.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S that contains R (not in position 2) and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BURKS – but K is allowed, U is allowed, R is allowed, but we need to check if all letters are allowed. B, U, R, K, S – all allowed.
- FURKS – same letters, valid word.
- GURKS – same.
- PURKS – same.
- MURKS – same.
- WARDS – but D is ruled out.
- BURPS – but P is allowed, but no R in this word.
- BURRS – but has two R's, which is allowed, but S is already in position 5.
- BURKS seems valid.

Let's check BURKS:
- B: allowed
- U: allowed
- R: allowed (position 3)
- K: allowed
- S: correct position 5

This fits all constraints.

Another option is ""BURPS"", but it doesn't contain R, so it can't be right.

Another option is ""BURRS"", which has R in positions 3 and 4 – both allowed, but let's see if it's better to try BURKS first.

I'll go with BURKS.

From the feedback so far:

1. Pattern locked in: B U R _ S (positions 1-2-3-5 are confirmed)
2. Letters ruled out completely: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N, D, O, K
3. Remaining unused letters that could fit position 4 (must not be any of the ruled-out letters): F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with ""BUR"" and ends with ""S"", with the fourth letter being one of the allowed ones.

Possible candidates:
- BURFS – but ""BURFS"" isn't a valid English word.
- BURGS – ""BURGS"" is valid (plural of burg).
- BURMS – ""BURMS"" is valid (plural of burm).
- BURPS – ""BURPS"" is valid (past tense of burp).
- BURYS – ""BURYS"" is valid (past tense of bury).

Among these, ""BURGS"" is a common word, so it's a good next guess to test the fourth letter G.
