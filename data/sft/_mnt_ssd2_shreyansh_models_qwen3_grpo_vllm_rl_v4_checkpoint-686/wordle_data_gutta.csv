### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters
2. It contains some of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E)
3. It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

From the feedback on AROSE:

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, T  

Specific positional information:
- A is NOT in position 1 or 2 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).
- T is NOT in position 1 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).

So the secret word:
- Contains both A and T exactly once each.
- Contains no R, O, S, E, I, N.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Uses A and T in new positions.
2. Uses only the allowed letters.
3. Adds new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “PLATY”:
- P, L, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- T is in position 4 (allowed).

This gives us three new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, T  

Exact positional info:
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in every guess so far).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4, but position 4 is already taken by T.  
  This contradiction means my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-examining the “A(-)” feedback:
- “-” means A is in the word but NOT in the position shown.  
  In PLATY, A was in position 3, so A is NOT in position 3.

Correct positional constraints so far:
- T is fixed in position 4.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 → impossible.  
  Therefore A must appear at least once in position 4, but position 4 is already T.  
  This implies A is not in the word, contradicting the “-” feedback.

Conclusion: A must appear exactly once and must be in position 4, but position 4 is T.

TAINT: A(-) means A is in word, not position 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

A good first guess would be ""AROSE"" because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters
2. It contains some of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E)
3. It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Does contain A, but A is NOT in position 1.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A good next guess could be ""TAINT"":
- Contains A (in position 2, so not position 1).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.
- Uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, T  

Specific positional information:
- A is NOT in position 1 or 2 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).
- T is NOT in position 1 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).

So the secret word:
- Contains both A and T exactly once each.
- Contains no R, O, S, E, I, N.
- A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- T must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Remaining common consonants: D, L, C, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Uses A and T in new positions.
2. Uses only the allowed letters.
3. Adds new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “PLATY”:
- P, L, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- T is in position 4 (allowed).

This gives us three new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

- T is fixed in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in every guess).  
  This is impossible for a 5-letter word, so the only explanation is that A appears twice: once in position 4 (which must be T, so this is impossible) or that I misread the feedback.

- A is NOT in position 1 or 2 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).
- T is NOT in position 1 or 5 (it was marked “-” in both guesses and is in the wrong position each time).

From all feedback so far:

Exact positional info:
- T is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (it was “-” in every guess so far).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4, but position 4 is already taken by T.  
  This contradiction means my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-examining the “A(-)” feedback:
- “-” means A is in the word but NOT in the position shown.  
  In PLATY, A was in position 3, so A is NOT in position 3.

Correct positional constraints so far:
- T is fixed in position 4.
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 → impossible.  
  Therefore A must appear at least once in position 4, but position 4 is already T.  
  This implies A is not in the word, contradicting the “-” feedback.

Conclusion: A must appear exactly once and must be in position 4, but position 4 is T.  
Hence the only possibility is that the word contains A twice, once in position 4 and once elsewhere, but Wordle words typically have unique letters.  
Rechecking feedback: AROSE: A(-) means A is in word, not position 1.  
TAINT: A(-) means A is in word, not position 2.  
PLATY: A(-) means A is in word, not position 3.  
So A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is T (✓), so A must be in position 5.

Therefore:
- Word ends with A.
- Contains T in position 4.
- Contains no R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y.

Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: PLATY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
Guess 4: BATCH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) T(✓) C(x) H(x)

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y, B, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, T  

Positional constraints:
- T is fixed in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in every guess).  
  This is impossible for a 5-letter word, so the only explanation is that A appears twice: once in position 4 (which must be T, so this is impossible) or that I misread the feedback.

Rechecking:
- AROSE: A(-) → A is in word, not position 1.
- TAINT: A(-) → A is in word, not position 2.
- PLATY: A(-) → A is in word, not position 3.
- BATCH: A(-) → A is in word, not position 2.

Thus A must be in position 5 (only remaining spot), and T must be in position 4.  
Word pattern: _ _ _ T A  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common English 5-letter words fitting _ _ _ T A:
- FUGTA? No.
- MUTTA? No.
- DUTTA? No.
- GUTTA? No.
- LUTTA? L is excluded.
- VULTA? No.
- JUTTA? No.
- KUTTA? Yes, “KUTTA” is a valid English word (variant of “kutta” meaning a dog or a type of bird).

“KUTTA” uses only allowed letters and fits the pattern.

From the feedback on KUTTA:
- K(x) → K is not in the word.
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T(✓) → The second T is also in the correct position (position 4).
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown (but we know it cannot be any of the letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y, B, C, H, K).
- Position 2: U (fixed).
- Position 3: T (fixed).
- Position 4: T (fixed).
- Position 5: A (fixed).

Thus the word is of the form _ U T T A.

Looking at common 5-letter English words ending in ""UTTA"":
- The only common word is ""DUTTA"" (though it's a surname, it's recognized as a word in some dictionaries), but D hasn't been tested yet.
- Another possibility is ""GUTTA"", but G hasn't been tested either.
- ""MUTTA"" is another variant, but M hasn't been tested.

From the letters not yet ruled out (excluding all previously excluded letters), the possible starting letters are: D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Among these, ""DUTTA"" is the most plausible common word. Since D hasn't been tested yet, this is a valid guess.
