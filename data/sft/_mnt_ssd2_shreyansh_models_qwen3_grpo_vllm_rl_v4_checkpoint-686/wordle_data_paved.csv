### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will help narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is NOT in the word at all.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

A good candidate is ""TREAD"":
- T, R, E, A, D.
But R is excluded, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""LEANT"":
- L, E, A, N, T.
This has A and E, no R, O, or S.
A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 2 (not 5). This seems valid.

A is in position 3, E in position 2. Valid.

""LEANT"" seems slightly better because N and T are common consonants.

""PLATE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E  
Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, M, N, T  

Positions we can eliminate:
- A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.

So the remaining possible positions for A are 2, 4, 5 and for E are 1, 3, 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Contains none of R, O, S, M, N, T.
3. Respects the positional exclusions above.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: A, E, I, U (but we already have A and E).

Let’s list candidate words meeting these constraints:

- BEACH – contains C, H (valid), but E is in position 2 (invalid).  
- PEACH – same issue, E in 2.  
- LEAFY – has L, E, A, F, Y. E in 2 (invalid).  
- CABLE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- GLADE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- FAECI – not a valid word.  
- HEAVE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- LAYER – contains R (invalid).  
- VEXED – contains X and D, but E in 4, A missing.

  – letters P, L, E, A, D (none of the forbidden letters).  
  – E in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed).  

PLEAD seems to be a valid candidate.

Another check:  
- PLEAD: P, L, E, A, D – no R, O, S, M, N, T.  
- E is in position 3 (not 2 or 5) – allowed.  
- A is in position 4 (not 1 or 3) – allowed.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Looking at these letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and E somewhere.
- Does not have R, O, or S.
- A is not in position 1, E is not in position 5.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A good candidate is ""TREAD"":
- T, R, E, A, D.
But R is excluded, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""LEANT"":
- L, E, A, N, T.
This has A and E, no R, O, or S.
A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 2 (not 5). This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PEACH"":
- P, E, A, C, H.
This has A and E, no R, O, or S.
A is in position 3, E in position 2. Valid.

""LEANT"" seems slightly better because N and T are common consonants.

But let me think of another: ""PLATE"":
- P, L, A, T, E.
A in position 3, E in position 5 (invalid because E can't be in 5).

""PLATE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

""PEACH"" is valid: E in 2, A in 3.

""HEART"" is invalid because R is in it.

""MEANT"":
- M, E, A, N, T.
This is valid: A in 3, E in 2, no R, O, or S.

""MEANT"" seems good.

Another: ""BEACH"":
- B, E, A, C, H.
Valid: A in 3, E in 2.

Between ""MEANT"" and ""BEACH"", both are good, but ""MEANT"" has N and T which are very common.

I'll go with ""MEANT"".

Guess 2: MEANT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word (but positions still unknown): A, E  
Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, M, N, T  

Positions we can eliminate:
- A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- E is not in positions 2 or 5.

So the remaining possible positions for A are 2, 4, 5 and for E are 1, 3, 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Contains none of R, O, S, M, N, T.
3. Respects the positional exclusions above.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: A, E, I, U (but we already have A and E).

Let’s list candidate words meeting these constraints:

- BEACH – contains C, H (valid), but E is in position 2 (invalid).  
- PEACH – same issue, E in 2.  
- LEAFY – has L, E, A, F, Y. E in 2 (invalid).  
- CABLE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- GLADE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- FAECI – not a valid word.  
- HEAVE – E in 4, A in 3 (invalid for A).  
- LAYER – contains R (invalid).  
- VEXED – contains X and D, but E in 4, A missing.  
- CEDAR – contains R (invalid).  
- PLEAD – E in 3, A in 4. This satisfies:
  – letters P, L, E, A, D (none of the forbidden letters).  
  – E in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed).  

PLEAD seems to be a valid candidate.

Another check:  
- PLEAD: P, L, E, A, D – no R, O, S, M, N, T.  
- E is in position 3 (not 2 or 5) – allowed.  
- A is in position 4 (not 1 or 3) – allowed.  

So PLEAD is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- P is in position 1 (✓)
- D is in position 5 (✓)

Letters we know are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- A (not in 1, 3, 4)
- E (not in 2, 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, M, N, T, L

So the word structure is: P _ _ _ D with A and E somewhere in positions 2 and 3 (since 4 is excluded for A and 2,3,5 excluded for E).

Possible positions:
- A can only be in position 2 (since 1,3,4 are excluded and 5 is already D)
- E must be in position 3 (since 2,5 excluded and 1,4 are possible but 4 is excluded for A)

Thus the word must be: P A E _ D

Looking at remaining letters (not R,O,S,M,N,T,L) and needing a valid 5-letter word:
Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, Z

Wait, let me think differently. The word structure is P _ _ _ D with A and E in positions 2 and 3 (since 4 is excluded for A and 2,3,5 excluded for E). Thus positions 2 and 3 must be A and E in some order.
