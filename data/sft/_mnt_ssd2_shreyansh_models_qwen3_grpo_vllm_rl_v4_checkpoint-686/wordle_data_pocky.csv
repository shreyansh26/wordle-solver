1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, N  
- Letters that **are** in the word, but in the wrong positions:
  – C is in the word, but **not** in position 1.
  – O is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- Letter that is **correctly placed**:
  – Y is in position 5.

So the pattern we’re looking for is:
_ _ _ _ Y
with the constraints:
- Must contain C and O somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
- Must **not** contain S, L, A, T, E, R, N.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Good vowels left: I, U (plus the already-known O).

I’ll try a word that places C and O in new positions and uses other high-frequency letters.  
A good candidate is “DOUBT”:
- D, O, U, B, T  
But T is already eliminated, so that’s no good.

Next candidate: “FOULY”
- F, O, U, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “CHOPY”
- C, H, O, P, Y → H and P are still allowed, and C and O are in new positions (C in 1, but C cannot be in 1). So that’s invalid.

Next: “COBLY”
- C, O, B, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “COMFY”
- C, O, M, F, Y → C is in position 1 (invalid), and M, F are allowed.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it has:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback shows that none of the letters in ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) are in the secret word at all. This means I should avoid those five letters completely.

I need a new 5-letter word that does NOT contain S, L, A, T, or E. To maximize information, I'll choose a word with other high-frequency letters that weren't eliminated. Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F. Good vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess would use a mix of these. ""CRONY"" is a good candidate:
- C, R, O, N, Y – none of these were in the first guess.
- It covers two new vowels (O) and three high-frequency consonants (C, R, N).

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, N  
- Letters that **are** in the word, but in the wrong positions:
  – C is in the word, but **not** in position 1.
  – O is in the word, but **not** in position 3.
- Letter that is **correctly placed**:
  – Y is in position 5.

So the pattern we’re looking for is:
_ _ _ _ Y
with the constraints:
- Must contain C and O somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
- Must **not** contain S, L, A, T, E, R, N.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Good vowels left: I, U (plus the already-known O).

I’ll try a word that places C and O in new positions and uses other high-frequency letters.  
A good candidate is “DOUBT”:
- D, O, U, B, T  
But T is already eliminated, so that’s no good.

Next candidate: “FOULY”
- F, O, U, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “CHOPY”
- C, H, O, P, Y → H and P are still allowed, and C and O are in new positions (C in 1, but C cannot be in 1). So that’s invalid.

Next: “COBLY”
- C, O, B, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “COMFY”
- C, O, M, F, Y → C is in position 1 (invalid), and M, F are allowed.

Next: “BOGGY”
- B, O, G, G, Y → O is in position 2 (allowed), G is allowed, B is allowed.

But I’d like to test C in position 2 or 3.  
A better choice: “COGGY”
- C in position 1 (invalid again).

Next: “MOPPY”
- M, O, P, P, Y → O in position 2 (allowed), P is allowed.

But let’s try a word that puts C in position 2 and O in position 4:  
“HOCKY”
- H, O, C, K, Y → C is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems good.

- F, O, U, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “CHOPY”
- C, H, O, P, Y → H and P are still allowed, and C and O are in new positions (C in 1, but C cannot be in 1). So that’s invalid.

Next: “COBLY”
- C, O, B, L, Y → L is eliminated.

Next: “COMFY”
- C, O, M, F, Y → C is in position 1 (invalid), and M, F are allowed.

Next: “BOGGY”
- B, O, G, G, Y → O is in position 2 (allowed), G is allowed, B is allowed.

But I’d like to test C in position 2 or 3.  
A better choice: “COGGY”
- C in position 1 (invalid again).

Next: “MOPPY”
- M, O, P, P, Y → O in position 2 (allowed), P is allowed.

But let’s try a word that puts C in position 2 and O in position 4:  
“HOCKY”
- H, O, C, K, Y → C is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) O(-) N(x) Y(✓)
Guess 3: HOCKY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓) Y(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, N, H  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – O is in position 2 (✓)
  – C is in position 3 (✓)
  – K is in position 4 (✓)
  – Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ O C K Y

The only missing letter is in position 1.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common English 5-letter words ending in “OCKY” with an initial consonant, the most likely candidate is:

B → BOCKY (valid, though uncommon)
D → DOCKY (valid)
F → FOCKY (not a common word)
G → GOCKY (not standard)
M → MOCKY (valid and common)

“MOCKY” is the most plausible word.

We now know the exact pattern: _ O C K Y

Remaining consonants that can start a valid English word followed by “OCKY”:
- B → BOCKY (valid, though rare)
- D → DOCKY (valid)
- F → FOCKY (not standard)
- G → GOCKY (not standard)

Between DOCKY and BOCKY, “DOCKY” is the more common word.
