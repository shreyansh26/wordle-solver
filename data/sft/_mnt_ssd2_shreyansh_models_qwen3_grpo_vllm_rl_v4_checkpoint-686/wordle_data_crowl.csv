For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any letters to cover as much ground as possible. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains five very common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, L is in position 2, so the secret word must have L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4, or 5).
- A, T, E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L (not in position 2).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to test new positions.

Good next letters to test (since A, E, T are out) are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since L must move, let's try placing L in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- LURID (L, U, R, I, D) – L in position 1.
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) – L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2, so skip).

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, L is in position 2, so the secret word must have L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4, or 5).
- A, T, E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L (not in position 2).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to test new positions.

Good next letters to test (since A, E, T are out) are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since L must move, let's try placing L in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- LURID (L, U, R, I, D) – L in position 1.
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) – L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2, so skip).
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLINK (B, L, I, N, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- GLINT (G, L, I, N, T) – T is out.
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- LUNGI (L, U, N, G, I) – L in position 1.

""LUNGI"" uses L in position 1 (valid), and introduces U, N, G, I which are new letters to test.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LUNGI -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNGI → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I.
2. The letter L is in the word but has been placed in the wrong position twice:
   - In SLATE (position 2) it was marked (-).
   - In LUNGI (position 1) it was also marked (-).
   Therefore, L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: R, O, D, C, M, P, B, F, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and use new common letters like R, O, D, etc.:
- Possible candidates: BLOWY (B, L, O, W, Y) – L in position 2 (invalid), so skip.
- CROWD (C, R, O, W, D) – no L.
- FLOOD (F, L, O, O, D) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOOM (B, L, O, O, M) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- CLOMP (C, L, O, M, P) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – E is out.
- BLOOM – already considered.
- FLOCK (F, L, O, C, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOKE – E is out.
- BLOOM – invalid position for L.

Let’s try L in position 4:
- Possible candidates: BORAL (B, O, R, A, L) – A is out.
- CORAL (C, O, R, A, L) – A is out.
- FOLAR (F, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- MOLAR (M, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- POLAR (P, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- BORAL – invalid.
- BOLAR – A is out.
- BOLLY (B, O, L, L, Y) – double L, but L in position 3 is valid.

Let’s try L in position 5:
- Possible candidates: BORAL (A out).
- CORAL (A out).
- BOLLY (L in position 4, but we want L in 5).
- BORCH (B, O, R, C, H) – no L.
- BORNE (B, O, R, N, E) – N and E out.
- BORNE – invalid.
- BORIC (B, O, R, I, C) – I out.
- BORON (B, O, R, O, N) – N out.
- BOROL (B, O, R, O, L) – O and R are fine, L in position 5.

""BOROL"" seems valid:
- Letters: B, O, R, O, L.
- All letters are not yet ruled out.
- L is in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s go with BOROL.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any letters to cover as much ground as possible. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains five very common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

Guess 4: FROLY → F(x) R(✓) O(✓) L(-) Y(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters NOT in the word: F, Y (added to previous list: S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I, B, F, Y).
2. R is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
3. O is now confirmed in position 3 (✓).
4. L must be in the word but is NOT in position 5 (since L(-) in position 5), and it hasn't been placed yet in positions 1, 2, or 4 (positions 2 and 3 are already taken by R and O). Therefore, L must be in position 4.
5. Remaining letters to test: C, D, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

So the word structure is: _ R O L _ with the last letter being any unused letter not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- CROOK (C, R, O, O, K) – but O is already in position 3, and we don't know if there are two O's.
- CROMB – B is out.
- CROAK – A is out.

- CROFT – T is out.

The most straightforward valid word fitting the pattern is ""CROOK"" or ""PROWL"". Between these, ""CROOK"" uses C and K which are new letters and fit the pattern _ R O L _.

But wait, the pattern is _ R O L _ (positions 2=R, 3=O, 4=L), so the word would be _ R O L _. The only valid 5-letter words fitting this are ""CROOK"" (C, R, O, O, K) – but that would place O in position 4, conflicting with our deduction that O is in position 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any letters to cover as much ground as possible. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains five very common letters and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word at all (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In SLATE, L is in position 2, so the secret word must have L somewhere else (positions 1,3,4, or 5).
- A, T, E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L (not in position 2).
- Does not contain S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to test new positions.

Good next letters to test (since A, E, T are out) are R, O, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Since L must move, let's try placing L in position 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 and use new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- LURID (L, U, R, I, D) – L in position 1.
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) – L in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2, so skip).
- FLUNK (F, L, U, N, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLINK (B, L, I, N, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- GLINT (G, L, I, N, T) – T is out.
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- LUNGI (L, U, N, G, I) – L in position 1.

""LUNGI"" uses L in position 1 (valid), and introduces U, N, G, I which are new letters to test.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: LUNGI → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I.
2. The letter L is in the word but has been placed in the wrong position twice:
   - In SLATE (position 2) it was marked (-).
   - In LUNGI (position 1) it was also marked (-).
   Therefore, L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
3. Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: R, O, D, C, M, P, B, F, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and use new common letters like R, O, D, etc.:
- Possible candidates: BLOWY (B, L, O, W, Y) – L in position 2 (invalid), so skip.
- CROWD (C, R, O, W, D) – no L.
- FLOOD (F, L, O, O, D) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOOM (B, L, O, O, M) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- CLOMP (C, L, O, M, P) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOKE (B, L, O, K, E) – E is out.
- BLOOM – already considered.
- FLOCK (F, L, O, C, K) – L in position 2 (invalid).
- BLOKE – E is out.
- BLOOM – invalid position for L.

Let’s try L in position 4:
- Possible candidates: BORAL (B, O, R, A, L) – A is out.
- CORAL (C, O, R, A, L) – A is out.
- FOLAR (F, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- MOLAR (M, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- POLAR (P, O, L, A, R) – A is out.
- BORAL – invalid.
- BOLAR – A is out.
- BOLLY (B, O, L, L, Y) – double L, but L in position 3 is valid.

Let’s try L in position 5:
- Possible candidates: BORAL (A out).
- CORAL (A out).
- BOLLY (L in position 4, but we want L in 5).
- BORCH (B, O, R, C, H) – no L.
- BORNE (B, O, R, N, E) – N and E out.
- BORNE – invalid.
- BORIC (B, O, R, I, C) – I out.
- BORON (B, O, R, O, N) – N out.
- BOROL (B, O, R, O, L) – O and R are fine, L in position 5.

""BOROL"" seems valid:
- Letters: B, O, R, O, L.
- All letters are not yet ruled out.
- L is in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s go with BOROL.

From Guess 5 (PROWL) we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
Position 2: R(✓) → R is in position 2.
Position 3: O(✓) → O is in position 3.
Position 4: W(✓) → W is in position 4.
Position 5: L(✓) → L is in position 5.

So the secret word must be: _ R O W L

The only letter left to determine is the first character. From previous feedback, the letters that are NOT in the word are: S, A, T, E, U, N, G, I, B, F, Y, P. The remaining possible starting letters are: C, D, H, K, M, V, etc.

Looking at valid 5-letter English words that fit the pattern _ R O W L:

- CROWL – not a valid word.
- DROWL – valid (archaic/dialectal for ""to doze"").
