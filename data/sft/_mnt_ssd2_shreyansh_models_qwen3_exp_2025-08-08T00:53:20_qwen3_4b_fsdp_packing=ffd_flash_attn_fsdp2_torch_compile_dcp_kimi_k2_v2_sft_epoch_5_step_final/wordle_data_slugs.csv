### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several common consonants and vowels.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Next, I want a word that still uses very common remaining letters.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good second-guess candidate should pack in several of these while keeping to 5 unique letters.  
“SLOTH” is a strong choice: S, L, O, T, H – none of them were in CRANE, and together they cover a broad set of common consonants and vowels.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters that are completely out: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H  
- Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their positions): S, L

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining alphabet, and it must contain both S and L at least once.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency):  
D, I, U, M, Y, G, B, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and L.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses no ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H).

A quick scan of possibilities gives “FLUSH”:
- Letters: F, L, U, S, H  
- But H is already ruled out → discard.

Next candidate: “BUILD”
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D  
- No S → discard.

Candidate: “SLUMP”
- Letters: S, L, U, M, P  
- All letters allowed and we already know S and L are in the word.  
- This tests new letters U, M, P while keeping S and L.

Therefore, “SLUMP” is a strong next guess.

From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → all letters x (C, R, A, N, E are out).
2. SLOTH → S(✓) L(✓) O(x) T(x) H(x) → S and L are in the word; O, T, H are out.
3. SLUMP → S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) → S, L, U are in the word; M, P are out.

So far we know the secret word must contain S, L, U and cannot contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, M, P.

Remaining common letters: D, I, G, B, F, K, W, V, Y, X, Z, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, U (each at least once).
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Does not reuse any of the banned letters.

Possible positions for S, L, U: there are 3! = 6 permutations of these three letters within the 5-letter word, with two additional letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s list some candidates:
- SU__D: but we need 5 letters, so SU__D is invalid (only 4 letters).
- SUL__ : need two more letters. SULID (a type of fish) – but I is allowed, D is allowed. However, ""SULID"" is a valid 5-letter word? Actually, ""SULID"" is a valid English word (relating to the fish Sulphur). But let's check if it uses allowed letters: S, U, L, I, D – none are banned. This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""SULKS"" – but K is allowed, S is allowed, but this repeats S at the end, and we don't know if letters can repeat. The problem doesn't specify whether letters can repeat, but in Wordle-like games, letters can repeat. However, since we haven't seen any repeats in feedback, it's safer to assume no repeats for now.

Another candidate: ""SULFY"" – but F and Y are allowed, but ""SULFY"" is not a standard English word.

""SULID"" seems the best available option that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check: letters in ""SULID"" are S, U, L, I, D. None of these are in the banned list. It contains S, L, U as required. It's a valid 5-letter word (though less common, it's recognized in English dictionaries).

Therefore, ""SULID"" is a strong next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Next, I want a word that still uses very common remaining letters.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good second-guess candidate should pack in several of these while keeping to 5 unique letters.  
“SLOTH” is a strong choice: S, L, O, T, H – none of them were in CRANE, and together they cover a broad set of common consonants and vowels.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters that are completely out: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H  
- Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their positions): S, L

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining alphabet, and it must contain both S and L at least once.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency):  
D, I, U, M, Y, G, B, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and L.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses no ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H).

A quick scan of possibilities gives “FLUSH”:
- Letters: F, L, U, S, H  
- But H is already ruled out → discard.

Next candidate: “BUILD”
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D  
- No S → discard.

Candidate: “SLUMP”
- Letters: S, L, U, M, P  
- All letters allowed and we already know S and L are in the word.  
- This tests new letters U, M, P while keeping S and L.

Therefore, “SLUMP” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word: S, L, U  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, M, P, I, D  

So the secret word must contain S, L, U exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted), and two additional letters that are **not** in the banned list.

Remaining usable letters (alphabet minus banned set):  
B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

- No banned letters appear.

Possible two-letter combinations from remaining set:
- B + F → BF
- B + G → BG

- Y + Z → YZ

For each combination, we can form 6 permutations of the multiset {S, L, U, x, y}.  
We only need to check a few real words.

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That means I must avoid C, R, A, N, E entirely.

Next, I want a word that still uses very common remaining letters.  
The remaining high-frequency letters are: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good second-guess candidate should pack in several of these while keeping to 5 unique letters.  
“SLOTH” is a strong choice: S, L, O, T, H – none of them were in CRANE, and together they cover a broad set of common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) O(x) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

- Letters that are completely out: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H  
- Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their positions): S, L

So every letter in the secret word must come from the remaining alphabet, and it must contain both S and L at least once.

Remaining common letters (in roughly descending frequency):  
D, I, U, M, Y, G, B, F, K, W, V, X, Z, Q, J

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and L.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Uses no ruled-out letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H).

A quick scan of possibilities gives “FLUSH”:
- Letters: F, L, U, S, H  
- But H is already ruled out → discard.

Next candidate: “BUILD”
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D  
- No S → discard.

Candidate: “SLUMP”
- Letters: S, L, U, M, P  
- All letters allowed and we already know S and L are in the word.  
- This tests new letters U, M, P while keeping S and L.

Therefore, “SLUMP” is a strong next guess.

Guess 3: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. CRANE → all letters x (C, R, A, N, E are out).
2. SLOTH → S(✓) L(✓) O(x) T(x) H(x) → S and L are in the word; O, T, H are out.
3. SLUMP → S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x) → S, L, U are in the word; M, P are out.

So far we know the secret word must contain S, L, U and cannot contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, M, P.

Remaining common letters: D, I, G, B, F, K, W, V, Y, X, Z, Q, J.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, L, U (each at least once).
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Does not reuse any of the banned letters.

Possible positions for S, L, U: there are 3! = 6 permutations of these three letters within the 5-letter word, with two additional letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s list some candidates:
- SU__D: but we need 5 letters, so SU__D is invalid (only 4 letters).
- SUL__ : need two more letters. SULID (a type of fish) – but I is allowed, D is allowed. However, ""SULID"" is a valid 5-letter word? Actually, ""SULID"" is a valid English word (relating to the fish Sulphur). But let's check if it uses allowed letters: S, U, L, I, D – none are banned. This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""SULKS"" – but K is allowed, S is allowed, but this repeats S at the end, and we don't know if letters can repeat. The problem doesn't specify whether letters can repeat, but in Wordle-like games, letters can repeat. However, since we haven't seen any repeats in feedback, it's safer to assume no repeats for now.

Another candidate: ""SULFY"" – but F and Y are allowed, but ""SULFY"" is not a standard English word.

""SULID"" seems the best available option that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check: letters in ""SULID"" are S, U, L, I, D. None of these are in the banned list. It contains S, L, U as required. It's a valid 5-letter word (though less common, it's recognized in English dictionaries).

Therefore, ""SULID"" is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters known to be in the word: S, L, U  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, M, P, I, D  

So the secret word must contain S, L, U exactly once each (since no duplicates have been hinted), and two additional letters that are **not** in the banned list.

Remaining usable letters (alphabet minus banned set):  
B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, U plus two distinct letters from the remaining set, and in which:
- S, L, U each appear once.
- No banned letters appear.

Let’s list every possible 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints and see which one makes sense.

Possible two-letter combinations from remaining set:
- B + F → BF
- B + G → BG
- …
- Y + Z → YZ

For each combination, we can form 6 permutations of the multiset {S, L, U, x, y}.  
We only need to check a few real words.

Candidate words:
- BULKS – uses B, U, L, K, S → all allowed letters and contains S, L, U  
- FULKS – not a word  
- GULKS – not a word  
- JULKS – not a word  
- BULKS is the only common word that fits.

Let’s verify:
- B, U, L, K, S  
- None are in the banned list.  
- Contains S, L, U.  
- “BULKS” is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BULKS.

From the five guesses we now have:

Known letters in the word: S, L, U  
Known letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, H, M, P, I, D, B, K  

So the secret word must contain S, L, U exactly once each and must contain two additional letters chosen only from the remaining alphabet: F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, U plus two different letters from {F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} and has S in the 5th position (because in BULKS the S was marked ✓ in position 5).

Therefore the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S with the remaining four positions filled by L, U and two other allowed letters.

Let’s list all possible 4-letter combinations of {L, U} ∪ {F, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} that can form a real 5-letter word ending in S.

Possible real words:
