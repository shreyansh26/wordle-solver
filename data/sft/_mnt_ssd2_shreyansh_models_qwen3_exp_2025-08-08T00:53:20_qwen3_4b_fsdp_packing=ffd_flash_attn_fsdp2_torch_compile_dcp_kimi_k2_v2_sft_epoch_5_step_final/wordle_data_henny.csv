### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: A, R, O, S
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: U, T, I
   - N is in the word but not at position 2.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5 (confirmed again) and also not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, N
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N.
- E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
- N is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates: ""NEBEL"" (but B and L are allowed), ""NEMET"" (but T is eliminated), ""HENGY"" (but Y is allowed), ""LENTE"" (but E is repeated and T is eliminated).

A good next guess would be ""NEBEL"" (using N, E, B, E, L) but this has two E's which might not be optimal. Instead, ""HENGY"" tests H, E, N, G, Y with E in position 2 and N in position 3.

But ""LENTE"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEMET"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEBEL"" is a valid word but has two E's.

A better choice might be ""HENGY"" but Y is less common. ""NEBEL"" is actually a valid word (a type of cloud).

However, ""NEBEL"" has two E's which might not be the best for information. Instead, ""NEMET"" is invalid due to T. 

Another option: ""BENCH"" - uses B, E, N, C, H. E is in position 2, N in position 3. This tests new letters B, C, H.

This seems optimal as it tests three new consonants (B, C, H) and positions E and N correctly.

But wait, ""BENCH"" has E in position 2 and N in position 3. This fits our constraints:
- Contains E and N.
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's in 2).
- N not in 2 (it's in 3).
- No eliminated letters.

From the new feedback on BENCH:
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: _ E N _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C
- Letters in the word: E (pos 2), N (pos 3), H (somewhere else)
- H cannot be in position 5 (since that's where it was in BENCH).

Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y, plus H which must appear once more.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ E N _ _ that includes H exactly once (not in position 5) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for H: 1 or 4.

Let's list possible words:
- H E N _ _ : HEN_ _ , but HENGY is invalid (Y is allowed but G is allowed). HENGY is 5 letters but Y is last. However, HENGY is not a valid English word.
- _ E N H _ : Possible words: ""PENGH"" (invalid), ""HENGH"" (invalid), ""LENCH"" (C is invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid).

Valid English words fitting _ E N _ _ with H elsewhere:
- ""HEN"" as prefix is fixed, but we need two more letters. Since H must appear again, possible:
  - ""HEN"" + H + letter: but we need 5 letters total.
  - Actually, H could be in position 1: H E N _ _
    - HEN_ _ : HENGY is not valid, HENKS is invalid (K not tested but not eliminated), but HENKS is 5 letters but K is allowed (not in eliminated list). However, HENKS is not a valid English word.
  - H could be in position 4: _ E N H _
    - Possible: ""LENHM"" (invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid), ""PENHM"" (invalid).
  - H could be in position 5 is invalid since it was in BENCH position 5 and marked wrong position.

Wait, H was in position 5 in BENCH and marked (-), so H must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 2 and 3 are E and N. So H must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be H E N _ _. And it must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with HEN.

Valid English words starting with HEN:
- HENCH (but C is invalid)
- HENGI (I is invalid)
- HENNE (double N, but N is already in position 3)
- HENTH (invalid)
- HENUP (invalid)
- HENS_ (but S is invalid)
- HENYO (invalid)

Actually, ""HEN"" is the start, but we need two more letters. Since H must be in position 1, and we have H E N _ _, the remaining letters must be from allowed set: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- HENGY (not valid)
- HEN_ _ : looking for valid words, ""HENCH"" is invalid (C), ""HENGI"" invalid (I), ""HENNE"" has double N but N is already in position 3, ""HENGO"" (O invalid), ""HENGY"" invalid.

Wait, maybe I missed: ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - but not a word.
""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but needs to be 5 letters.

Actually, ""HEN"" is 3 letters, we need 5. The only valid English word starting with HEN and using allowed letters seems to be ""HENGY"" which is not valid. This suggests I might have missed possibilities.

Alternative: Maybe H is in position 4, making the word _ E N H _. Then possible:
- ""LENH_"" - but L is allowed, but need a 5th letter. ""LENHM"" invalid, ""LENHY"" not a word.
- ""VENH_"" - ""VENHM"" invalid.
- ""PENH_"" - ""PENHM"" invalid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possible words.

Actually, looking back, the word must be _ E N _ _ with H somewhere, and H cannot be in position 5 (from BENCH feedback). So H must be in position 1 or 4.

Position 1: H E N _ _
   - Need two more letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Valid English word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

Position 4: _ E N H _
   - Need first and fifth letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Possible: ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" not valid.
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" not valid.
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" not valid.
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" not valid.
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" not valid.
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" not valid.
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" not valid.

This suggests the only possible word is ""HEN"" + H + ""Y"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENHY"" which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" but that's ""HENG Y"" which is 5 letters but not valid.

I think I might have missed ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" which is not valid. 

Actually, looking at valid English words, the only one fitting is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" which is not valid. This seems impossible.

But let me think differently: Maybe the word is ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

This indicates I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From BENCH feedback:
- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)
- N is fixed at position 3 (✓)
- H is in the word but wrong position (was at 5, so must be at 1 or 4)
- B and C are eliminated
- Already eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C

So the word is either:
1. H E N _ _ (H at 1)
   - Need two letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - Valid word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HENDY"" is not valid.
   - ""HENGY"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - invalid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - invalid.

2. _ E N H _ (H at 4)
   - Need first and fifth letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" invalid
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" invalid
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" invalid
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" invalid
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" invalid
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" invalid
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" invalid

This seems impossible. Did I miss any valid word?

Wait, the word could be ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENGE"" - which is a valid English word (a stone circle or the sound of a stone hitting water).

""HENGE"" fits:
- H at 1 (new position)
- E at 2 (correct)
- N at 3 (correct)
- G at 4
- E at 5 - but we know E is already at 2, and letters can repeat? The feedback didn't say E only appears once.

But in BENCH feedback, E was marked ✓ at position 2, implying it's correct there, but doesn't prevent it from appearing again.

""HENGE"" is a valid word:
- H E N G E
- Contains E at 2 and 5
- N at 3
- H at 1
- G at 4
- All letters are allowed (A,R,O,S,U,T,I,B,C eliminated; H,E,N,G,E allowed)

This seems to fit all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is HENGE.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, positions 2 and 3 are fixed as E and N respectively, and H must appear somewhere else (positions 1 or 4). The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""HENGE"".

<guess>HENGE</guess>",HENGE,"From the new feedback on BENCH:

  - H could be in position 5 is invalid since it was in BENCH position 5 and marked wrong position.

Wait, H was in position 5 in BENCH and marked (-), so H must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 2 and 3 are E and N. So H must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be H E N _ _. And it must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with HEN.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (but not in the 5th position).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
Vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U.

A strong next guess would be something like ""UNTIE"" or ""ELITE"". ""UNTIE"" uses E in position 4 and tests U, N, T, I. ""ELITE"" uses E in position 1 and tests L, I, T, E. 

I'll go with ""UNTIE"" as it tests four new letters and places E in a different position.

<guess>UNTIE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: A, R, O, S
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: U, T, I
   - N is in the word but not at position 2.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5 (confirmed again) and also not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, N
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N.
- E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
- N is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates: ""NEBEL"" (but B and L are allowed), ""NEMET"" (but T is eliminated), ""HENGY"" (but Y is allowed), ""LENTE"" (but E is repeated and T is eliminated).

A good next guess would be ""NEBEL"" (using N, E, B, E, L) but this has two E's which might not be optimal. Instead, ""HENGY"" tests H, E, N, G, Y with E in position 2 and N in position 3.

But ""LENTE"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEMET"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEBEL"" is a valid word but has two E's.

A better choice might be ""HENGY"" but Y is less common. ""NEBEL"" is actually a valid word (a type of cloud).

However, ""NEBEL"" has two E's which might not be the best for information. Instead, ""NEMET"" is invalid due to T. 

Another option: ""BENCH"" - uses B, E, N, C, H. E is in position 2, N in position 3. This tests new letters B, C, H.

This seems optimal as it tests three new consonants (B, C, H) and positions E and N correctly.

But wait, ""BENCH"" has E in position 2 and N in position 3. This fits our constraints:
- Contains E and N.
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's in 2).
- N not in 2 (it's in 3).
- No eliminated letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: BENCH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BENCH:
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: _ E N _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C
- Letters in the word: E (pos 2), N (pos 3), H (somewhere else)
- H cannot be in position 5 (since that's where it was in BENCH).

Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y, plus H which must appear once more.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ E N _ _ that includes H exactly once (not in position 5) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for H: 1 or 4.

Let's list possible words:
- H E N _ _ : HEN_ _ , but HENGY is invalid (Y is allowed but G is allowed). HENGY is 5 letters but Y is last. However, HENGY is not a valid English word.
- _ E N H _ : Possible words: ""PENGH"" (invalid), ""HENGH"" (invalid), ""LENCH"" (C is invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid).

Valid English words fitting _ E N _ _ with H elsewhere:
- ""HEN"" as prefix is fixed, but we need two more letters. Since H must appear again, possible:
  - ""HEN"" + H + letter: but we need 5 letters total.
  - Actually, H could be in position 1: H E N _ _
    - HEN_ _ : HENGY is not valid, HENKS is invalid (K not tested but not eliminated), but HENKS is 5 letters but K is allowed (not in eliminated list). However, HENKS is not a valid English word.
  - H could be in position 4: _ E N H _
    - Possible: ""LENHM"" (invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid), ""PENHM"" (invalid).
  - H could be in position 5 is invalid since it was in BENCH position 5 and marked wrong position.

Wait, H was in position 5 in BENCH and marked (-), so H must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 2 and 3 are E and N. So H must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be H E N _ _. And it must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with HEN.

Valid English words starting with HEN:
- HENCH (but C is invalid)
- HENGI (I is invalid)
- HENNE (double N, but N is already in position 3)
- HENTH (invalid)
- HENUP (invalid)
- HENS_ (but S is invalid)
- HENYO (invalid)

Actually, ""HEN"" is the start, but we need two more letters. Since H must be in position 1, and we have H E N _ _, the remaining letters must be from allowed set: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- HENGY (not valid)
- HEN_ _ : looking for valid words, ""HENCH"" is invalid (C), ""HENGI"" invalid (I), ""HENNE"" has double N but N is already in position 3, ""HENGO"" (O invalid), ""HENGY"" invalid.

Wait, maybe I missed: ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - but not a word.
""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but needs to be 5 letters.

Actually, ""HEN"" is 3 letters, we need 5. The only valid English word starting with HEN and using allowed letters seems to be ""HENGY"" which is not valid. This suggests I might have missed possibilities.

Alternative: Maybe H is in position 4, making the word _ E N H _. Then possible:
- ""LENH_"" - but L is allowed, but need a 5th letter. ""LENHM"" invalid, ""LENHY"" not a word.
- ""VENH_"" - ""VENHM"" invalid.
- ""PENH_"" - ""PENHM"" invalid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possible words.

Actually, looking back, the word must be _ E N _ _ with H somewhere, and H cannot be in position 5 (from BENCH feedback). So H must be in position 1 or 4.

Position 1: H E N _ _
   - Need two more letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Valid English word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

Position 4: _ E N H _
   - Need first and fifth letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Possible: ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" not valid.
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" not valid.
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" not valid.
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" not valid.
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" not valid.
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" not valid.
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" not valid.

This suggests the only possible word is ""HEN"" + H + ""Y"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENHY"" which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" but that's ""HENG Y"" which is 5 letters but not valid.

I think I might have missed ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" which is not valid. 

Actually, looking at valid English words, the only one fitting is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" which is not valid. This seems impossible.

But let me think differently: Maybe the word is ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

This indicates I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From BENCH feedback:
- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)
- N is fixed at position 3 (✓)
- H is in the word but wrong position (was at 5, so must be at 1 or 4)
- B and C are eliminated
- Already eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C

So the word is either:
1. H E N _ _ (H at 1)
   - Need two letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - Valid word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HENDY"" is not valid.
   - ""HENGY"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - invalid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - invalid.

2. _ E N H _ (H at 4)
   - Need first and fifth letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" invalid
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" invalid
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" invalid
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" invalid
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" invalid
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" invalid
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" invalid

This seems impossible. Did I miss any valid word?

Wait, the word could be ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENGE"" - which is a valid English word (a stone circle or the sound of a stone hitting water).

""HENGE"" fits:
- H at 1 (new position)
- E at 2 (correct)
- N at 3 (correct)
- G at 4
- E at 5 - but we know E is already at 2, and letters can repeat? The feedback didn't say E only appears once.

But in BENCH feedback, E was marked ✓ at position 2, implying it's correct there, but doesn't prevent it from appearing again.

""HENGE"" is a valid word:
- H E N G E
- Contains E at 2 and 5
- N at 3
- H at 1
- G at 4
- All letters are allowed (A,R,O,S,U,T,I,B,C eliminated; H,E,N,G,E allowed)

This seems to fit all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is HENGE.Based on the feedback so far, positions 2 and 3 are fixed as E and N respectively, and H must appear somewhere else (positions 1 or 4). The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""HENGE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes E (but not in the 5th position).
- Avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.
Vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U.

A strong next guess would be something like ""UNTIE"" or ""ELITE"". ""UNTIE"" uses E in position 4 and tests U, N, T, I. ""ELITE"" uses E in position 1 and tests L, I, T, E. 

I'll go with ""UNTIE"" as it tests four new letters and places E in a different position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: A, R, O, S
   - E is in the word, but not at position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
   - Eliminates: U, T, I
   - N is in the word but not at position 2.
   - E is in the word but not at position 5 (confirmed again) and also not at position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, N
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N.
- E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
- N is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates: ""NEBEL"" (but B and L are allowed), ""NEMET"" (but T is eliminated), ""HENGY"" (but Y is allowed), ""LENTE"" (but E is repeated and T is eliminated).

A good next guess would be ""NEBEL"" (using N, E, B, E, L) but this has two E's which might not be optimal. Instead, ""HENGY"" tests H, E, N, G, Y with E in position 2 and N in position 3.

But ""LENTE"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEMET"" has T which is eliminated. ""NEBEL"" is a valid word but has two E's.

A better choice might be ""HENGY"" but Y is less common. ""NEBEL"" is actually a valid word (a type of cloud).

However, ""NEBEL"" has two E's which might not be the best for information. Instead, ""NEMET"" is invalid due to T. 

Another option: ""BENCH"" - uses B, E, N, C, H. E is in position 2, N in position 3. This tests new letters B, C, H.

This seems optimal as it tests three new consonants (B, C, H) and positions E and N correctly.

But wait, ""BENCH"" has E in position 2 and N in position 3. This fits our constraints:
- Contains E and N.
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's in 2).
- N not in 2 (it's in 3).
- No eliminated letters.

This seems like the best next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)
Guess 3: BENCH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BENCH:
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Positions 2 and 3 are fixed: _ E N _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C
- Letters in the word: E (pos 2), N (pos 3), H (somewhere else)
- H cannot be in position 5 (since that's where it was in BENCH).

Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y, plus H which must appear once more.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ E N _ _ that includes H exactly once (not in position 5) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for H: 1 or 4.

Let's list possible words:
- H E N _ _ : HEN_ _ , but HENGY is invalid (Y is allowed but G is allowed). HENGY is 5 letters but Y is last. However, HENGY is not a valid English word.
- _ E N H _ : Possible words: ""PENGH"" (invalid), ""HENGH"" (invalid), ""LENCH"" (C is invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid).

Valid English words fitting _ E N _ _ with H elsewhere:
- ""HEN"" as prefix is fixed, but we need two more letters. Since H must appear again, possible:
  - ""HEN"" + H + letter: but we need 5 letters total.
  - Actually, H could be in position 1: H E N _ _
    - HEN_ _ : HENGY is not valid, HENKS is invalid (K not tested but not eliminated), but HENKS is 5 letters but K is allowed (not in eliminated list). However, HENKS is not a valid English word.
  - H could be in position 4: _ E N H _
    - Possible: ""LENHM"" (invalid), ""VENHM"" (invalid), ""PENHM"" (invalid).
  - H could be in position 5 is invalid since it was in BENCH position 5 and marked wrong position.

Wait, H was in position 5 in BENCH and marked (-), so H must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But positions 2 and 3 are E and N. So H must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be H E N _ _. And it must be a valid 5-letter English word starting with HEN.

Valid English words starting with HEN:
- HENCH (but C is invalid)
- HENGI (I is invalid)
- HENNE (double N, but N is already in position 3)
- HENTH (invalid)
- HENUP (invalid)
- HENS_ (but S is invalid)
- HENYO (invalid)

Actually, ""HEN"" is the start, but we need two more letters. Since H must be in position 1, and we have H E N _ _, the remaining letters must be from allowed set: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- HENGY (not valid)
- HEN_ _ : looking for valid words, ""HENCH"" is invalid (C), ""HENGI"" invalid (I), ""HENNE"" has double N but N is already in position 3, ""HENGO"" (O invalid), ""HENGY"" invalid.

Wait, maybe I missed: ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - but not a word.
""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but needs to be 5 letters.

Actually, ""HEN"" is 3 letters, we need 5. The only valid English word starting with HEN and using allowed letters seems to be ""HENGY"" which is not valid. This suggests I might have missed possibilities.

Alternative: Maybe H is in position 4, making the word _ E N H _. Then possible:
- ""LENH_"" - but L is allowed, but need a 5th letter. ""LENHM"" invalid, ""LENHY"" not a word.
- ""VENH_"" - ""VENHM"" invalid.
- ""PENH_"" - ""PENHM"" invalid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possible words.

Actually, looking back, the word must be _ E N _ _ with H somewhere, and H cannot be in position 5 (from BENCH feedback). So H must be in position 1 or 4.

Position 1: H E N _ _
   - Need two more letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Valid English word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

Position 4: _ E N H _
   - Need first and fifth letters from allowed: D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y.
   - Possible: ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" not valid.
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" not valid.
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" not valid.
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" not valid.
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" not valid.
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" not valid.
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" not valid.

This suggests the only possible word is ""HEN"" + H + ""Y"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENHY"" which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" but that's ""HENG Y"" which is 5 letters but not valid.

I think I might have missed ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" which is not valid. 

Actually, looking at valid English words, the only one fitting is ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" which is not valid. This seems impossible.

But let me think differently: Maybe the word is ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.

This indicates I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From BENCH feedback:
- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)
- N is fixed at position 3 (✓)
- H is in the word but wrong position (was at 5, so must be at 1 or 4)
- B and C are eliminated
- Already eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C

So the word is either:
1. H E N _ _ (H at 1)
   - Need two letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - Valid word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.
   - ""HENDY"" is not valid.
   - ""HENGY"" is not valid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - invalid.
   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - invalid.

2. _ E N H _ (H at 4)
   - Need first and fifth letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y
   - ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" invalid
   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" invalid
   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" invalid
   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" invalid
   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" invalid
   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" invalid
   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" invalid

This seems impossible. Did I miss any valid word?

Wait, the word could be ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but that's 5 letters: ""HENGE"" - which is a valid English word (a stone circle or the sound of a stone hitting water).

""HENGE"" fits:
- H at 1 (new position)
- E at 2 (correct)
- N at 3 (correct)
- G at 4
- E at 5 - but we know E is already at 2, and letters can repeat? The feedback didn't say E only appears once.

But in BENCH feedback, E was marked ✓ at position 2, implying it's correct there, but doesn't prevent it from appearing again.

""HENGE"" is a valid word:
- H E N G E
- Contains E at 2 and 5
- N at 3
- H at 1
- G at 4
- All letters are allowed (A,R,O,S,U,T,I,B,C eliminated; H,E,N,G,E allowed)

This seems to fit all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is HENGE.Based on the feedback so far, positions 2 and 3 are fixed as E and N respectively, and H must appear somewhere else (positions 1 or 4). The only valid English word fitting these constraints is ""HENGE"".

From the new feedback on HENGE:
- H is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓).
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓).
- N is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- G is NOT in the word (x).
- The last E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the pattern is now:
H E N _ _
and the word must contain an additional E somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since position 2 already has E, and the feedback says this E is in the wrong position).

Letters NOT in the word so far: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C, G
Letters confirmed in the word: H (pos 1), E (pos 2), N (pos 3), and one more E (pos 4 or 5).

Remaining letters to consider: D, F, L, M, P, W, Y

Possible words:
H E N E _  or  H E N _ E

Looking at valid English words:
- HENNE: double N, but N is already at pos 3
- HENES: S is eliminated
- HENED: valid word (past tense of ""hend"")
- HENEF: not valid
- HENEL: not valid
- HENEM: not valid
- HENEP: not valid
- HENET: T is eliminated
- HENGY: not valid
- HENED is the only valid option here.

""HENED"" fits:

This seems impossible.\n\nBut let me think differently: Maybe the word is ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""G"" = ""HENDG"" - not valid.\n\nThis indicates I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:\n\nFrom BENCH feedback:\n- E is fixed at position 2 (✓)\n- N is fixed at position 3 (✓)\n- H is in the word but wrong position (was at 5, so must be at 1 or 4)\n- B and C are eliminated\n- Already eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, U, T, I, B, C\n\nSo the word is either:\n1. H E N _ _ (H at 1)\n   - Need two letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y\n   - Valid word: ""HENGY"" is not valid, ""HENKS"" is not valid, ""HENGL"" is not valid.\n   - ""HENDY"" is not valid.\n   - ""HENGY"" is not valid.\n   - ""HEN"" + ""D"" + ""Y"" = ""HENDY"" - invalid.\n   - ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""Y"" = ""HENG Y"" - invalid.\n\n2. _ E N H _ (H at 4)\n   - Need first and fifth letters from D, F, G, L, M, P, W, Y\n   - ""D E N H Y"" - ""DENHY"" invalid\n   - ""L E N H Y"" - ""LENHY"" invalid\n   - ""P E N H Y"" - ""PENHY"" invalid\n   - ""G E N H Y"" - ""GENHY"" invalid\n   - ""M E N H Y"" - ""MENHY"" invalid\n   - ""W E N H Y"" - ""WENHY"" invalid\n   - ""Y E N H Y"" - ""YENHY"" invalid\n\nThis seems impossible. Did I miss any valid word?\n\nWait, the word could be ""HEN"" + ""G"" + ""E"" = ""HENG E"" but that\'s 5 letters: ""HENGE"" - which is a valid English word (a stone circle or the sound of a stone hitting water).\n\n""HENGE"" fits:\n- H at 1 (new position)\n- E at 2 (correct)\n- N at 3 (correct)\n- G at 4\n- E at 5 - but we know E is already at 2, and letters can repeat?

From the feedback on HENED:
- H, E, N are correctly placed at positions 1, 2, 3 respectively (✓).
- The fourth letter E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- The fifth letter D is NOT in the word (x).

So the pattern is:
H E N _ _
and the word must contain an additional E in position 4 or 5, but:
- Position 4 currently has E (marked wrong position), so the E must be in position 5.
- Therefore, the word must be H E N _ E.

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): D, F, L, M, P, W, Y  
But D was just eliminated at position 5, so the missing fourth letter must be one of F, L, M, P, W, Y.

Valid English words fitting H E N _ E:
- HENNE – invalid (double N already at pos 3)
- HENFE – not a word
- HENLE – not a word
- HENME – not a word
- HENPE – not a word
- HENWE – not a word
- HENYE – not a word
- HENGE – already tried
- HENSE – S is eliminated
- HENKE – K not tested but not eliminated
- HENFE – not a word
- HENBE – B is eliminated
- HENDE – D is allowed at position 5, but we need a letter at position 4.

Looking at valid English words: HENKE is a surname but not common.  
The only remaining valid word is HENKE, but let's check if it fits all constraints:
- H(1), E(2), N(3), K(4), E(5)
- K has not been eliminated yet (only A,R,O,S,U,T,I,B,C,G,D are out)
- All letters are allowed
- Pattern matches HEN_E

Thus, the correct word must be HENKE.
