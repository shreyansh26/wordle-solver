### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which should give good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: - → in the word but wrong position (so L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position)
- A, T, E: x → not in the word

So far we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A, T, E
- The word contains L, but L is not in position 2.

Next guess should:
1. Include L in a different position (not 2).
2. Use other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T, E.

Good candidate words:

Summary of constraints so far:

Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, R, D  
Letters confirmed: L in position 4, O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 4 is already L).

Available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 4th position: _ _ _ L _
2. Contains O somewhere other than position 2.
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ L _
- _ O _ L _
- _ _ O L _
- _ _ _ L O

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:

- MOLAR – uses M, O, L, A, R; A and R are ruled out.
- POLYP – uses P, O, L, Y, P; Y is allowed, but we need to check if P is allowed (it hasn’t been ruled out).
- COULD – uses C, O, U, L, D; D is ruled out.
- FOULS – uses F, O, U, L, S; S is ruled out.
- GOLLY – uses G, O, L, L, Y; double L is fine, Y is allowed, no ruled-out letters.

GOLLY fits:
- G, O, L, L, Y – none of the ruled-out letters.
- L is in position 4 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (but feedback said O is in the word but wrong position; position 2 was its position in WORLD, so this is invalid). Oops, O can’t be in position 2.

Let’s try another:
- MOLLY – M, O, L, L, Y. Same issue, O in position 2.

Next:
- YOLKS – Y, O, L, K, S; S is ruled out.

Next:
- JOLLY – J, O, L, L, Y. J hasn’t been ruled out, O is in position 2 (invalid).

Next:
- BOLLY – B, O, L, L, Y. Same O-in-2 issue.

Next:
- FOLLY – F, O, L, L, Y. Same issue.

Next:
- COBOL – C, O, B, O, L. O appears twice; one O must be elsewhere. Positions: C(1), O(2) – but O can’t be in 2.

Next:
- FOYOT – F, O, Y, O, T; T is ruled out.

Next:
- POKAL – P, O, K, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COPAL – C, O, P, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- GOLIA – G, O, L, I, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- POLKA – P, O, L, K, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COYOL – C, O, Y, O, L; double O, T is ruled out but not here; positions: O in 2 and 4; 2 is invalid.

Next:
- KNOOL – K, N, O, O, L; double O, O in 3 and 4; 4 is L, so O in 3 is fine, but 4 is L. So K N O L – but that’s 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5-letter words with L in 4th position and O elsewhere (not 2nd).

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O _ _ L _ : O in 1st
   - OMBLY – O, M, B, L, Y. All letters allowed (M, B, Y not ruled out).
   - OCHRE – O, C, H, R, E; R and E ruled out.
   - OPINE – O, P, I, N, E; E ruled out.
   - OPIUM – O, P, I, U, M; U and M allowed.

2. _ O _ L _ : O in 2nd – but feedback says O is in wrong position, and in WORLD it was 2nd, so this is invalid.

3. _ _ O L _ : O in 3rd
   - HUMOL – H, U, M, O, L; but L must be 4th, so this is invalid (O is 4th, L must be 4th).

Wait, pattern is _ _ _ L _, so O must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

- 1st: O _ _ L _
  - OMBLY
  - OPILY – O, P, I, L, Y; but L must be 4th, so this would be O P I L Y – L is 4th, Y is 5th. OPILY is a word (variant of opal or a type of fly). Letters: O, P, I, L, Y – none are ruled out. This seems valid.

- 3rd: _ _ O L _
  - C R O L E – but E ruled out.
  - F R O L A – A ruled out.
  - M O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd, but 2nd is invalid.
  - P O K E L – E ruled out.
  - H O N L Y – H, O, N, L, Y; O is 2nd (invalid).
  - B O N L Y – same issue.

- 5th: _ _ _ L O
  - B L O C K – but L is 2nd, must be 4th.
  - C L O C K – L 2nd.
  - M I L O N – L 3rd.
  - F I L M O – L 3rd.
  - P I L A R – L 3rd, A ruled out.
  - G I L D O – D ruled out.
  - V I L L O – L 3rd and 4th, but 4th must be L, so V I L L O has L in 3rd and 4th, which is acceptable for 4th position, but O is 5th. Letters: V, I, L, L, O – none ruled out. This seems valid.

Between OMBLY, OPILY, and VILLO:

- OMBLY: O, M, B, L, Y – all allowed.
- OPILY: O, P, I, L, Y – all allowed.
- VILLO: V, I, L, L, O – all allowed.

OPILY seems more common (though rare), OMBLY is plausible, VILLO is a word (plural of villa).

Let’s choose OMBLY as it uses common remaining letters.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- L is confirmed in the 4th position.
- O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 5th).
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.

A valid word with L in 4th and O elsewhere is OMBLY.

- POLKA – P, O, L, K, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COYOL – C, O, Y, O, L; double O, T is ruled out but not here; positions: O in 2 and 4; 2 is invalid.

Next:
- KNOOL – K, N, O, O, L; double O, O in 3 and 4; 4 is L, so O in 3 is fine, but 4 is L. So K N O L – but that’s 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5-letter words with L in 4th position and O elsewhere (not 2nd).

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O _ _ L _ : O in 1st
   - OMBLY – O, M, B, L, Y. All letters allowed (M, B, Y not ruled out).
   - OCHRE – O, C, H, R, E; R and E ruled out.
   - OPINE – O, P, I, N, E; E ruled out.
   - OPIUM – O, P, I, U, M; U and M allowed.

2. _ O _ L _ : O in 2nd – but feedback says O is in wrong position, and in WORLD it was 2nd, so this is invalid.

3. _ _ O L _ : O in 3rd
   - HUMOL – H, U, M, O, L; but L must be 4th, so this is invalid (O is 4th, L must be 4th).

Wait, pattern is _ _ _ L _, so O must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

- 1st: O _ _ L _
  - OMBLY
  - OPILY – O, P, I, L, Y; but L must be 4th, so this would be O P I L Y – L is 4th, Y is 5th. OPILY is a word (variant of opal or a type of fly). Letters: O, P, I, L, Y – none are ruled out. This seems valid.

- 3rd: _ _ O L _
  - C R O L E – but E ruled out.
  - F R O L A – A ruled out.
  - M O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd, but 2nd is invalid.
  - P O K E L – E ruled out.
  - H O N L Y – H, O, N, L, Y; O is 2nd (invalid).
  - B O N L Y – same issue.

- 5th: _ _ _ L O
  - B L O C K – but L is 2nd, must be 4th.
  - C L O C K – L 2nd.
  - M I L O N – L 3rd.
  - F I L M O – L 3rd.
  - P I L A R – L 3rd, A ruled out.
  - G I L D O – D ruled out.
  - V I L L O – L 3rd and 4th, but 4th must be L, so V I L L O has L in 3rd and 4th, which is acceptable for 4th position, but O is 5th. Letters: V, I, L, L, O – none ruled out. This seems valid.

Between OMBLY, OPILY, and VILLO:

- OMBLY: O, M, B, L, Y – all allowed.
- OPILY: O, P, I, L, Y – all allowed.
- VILLO: V, I, L, L, O – all allowed.

OPILY seems more common (though rare), OMBLY is plausible, VILLO is a word (plural of villa).

Let’s choose OMBLY as it uses common remaining letters.Based on the feedback:
- L is confirmed in the 4th position.
- O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 5th).
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.

A valid word with L in 4th and O elsewhere is OMBLY.",Guess 3: OMBLY -> FEEDBACK: O(-) M(x) B(x) L(✓) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which should give good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: - → in the word but wrong position (so L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position)
- A, T, E: x → not in the word

So far we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A, T, E
- The word contains L, but L is not in position 2.

Next guess should:
1. Include L in a different position (not 2).
2. Use other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T, E.

Good candidate words:
- RULER (R, U, L, E, R) – but E is already ruled out.
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) – uses L in 2nd position, but we know L is not in 2nd position.
- FLING (F, L, I, N, G) – L in 2nd position again, same issue.
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) – L in 4th position (allowed), uses new letters W, O, R, D.

WORLD seems good: it includes L in 4th position (not 2nd), and introduces W, O, R, D which are common and untested.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: WORLD -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(-) R(x) L(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on WORLD:

- W: x → not in the word  
- O: - → in the word but wrong position (so O is present, not in position 2)  
- R: x → not in the word  
- L: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 4th position  
- D: x → not in the word  

Summary of constraints so far:

Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, R, D  
Letters confirmed: L in position 4, O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 4 is already L).

Available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 4th position: _ _ _ L _
2. Contains O somewhere other than position 2.
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ L _
- _ O _ L _
- _ _ O L _
- _ _ _ L O

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:

- MOLAR – uses M, O, L, A, R; A and R are ruled out.
- POLYP – uses P, O, L, Y, P; Y is allowed, but we need to check if P is allowed (it hasn’t been ruled out).
- COULD – uses C, O, U, L, D; D is ruled out.
- FOULS – uses F, O, U, L, S; S is ruled out.
- GOLLY – uses G, O, L, L, Y; double L is fine, Y is allowed, no ruled-out letters.

GOLLY fits:
- G, O, L, L, Y – none of the ruled-out letters.
- L is in position 4 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (but feedback said O is in the word but wrong position; position 2 was its position in WORLD, so this is invalid). Oops, O can’t be in position 2.

Let’s try another:
- MOLLY – M, O, L, L, Y. Same issue, O in position 2.

Next:
- YOLKS – Y, O, L, K, S; S is ruled out.

Next:
- JOLLY – J, O, L, L, Y. J hasn’t been ruled out, O is in position 2 (invalid).

Next:
- BOLLY – B, O, L, L, Y. Same O-in-2 issue.

Next:
- FOLLY – F, O, L, L, Y. Same issue.

Next:
- COBOL – C, O, B, O, L. O appears twice; one O must be elsewhere. Positions: C(1), O(2) – but O can’t be in 2.

Next:
- FOYOT – F, O, Y, O, T; T is ruled out.

Next:
- POKAL – P, O, K, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COPAL – C, O, P, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- GOLIA – G, O, L, I, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- POLKA – P, O, L, K, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COYOL – C, O, Y, O, L; double O, T is ruled out but not here; positions: O in 2 and 4; 2 is invalid.

Next:
- KNOOL – K, N, O, O, L; double O, O in 3 and 4; 4 is L, so O in 3 is fine, but 4 is L. So K N O L – but that’s 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5-letter words with L in 4th position and O elsewhere (not 2nd).

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O _ _ L _ : O in 1st
   - OMBLY – O, M, B, L, Y. All letters allowed (M, B, Y not ruled out).
   - OCHRE – O, C, H, R, E; R and E ruled out.
   - OPINE – O, P, I, N, E; E ruled out.
   - OPIUM – O, P, I, U, M; U and M allowed.

2. _ O _ L _ : O in 2nd – but feedback says O is in wrong position, and in WORLD it was 2nd, so this is invalid.

3. _ _ O L _ : O in 3rd
   - HUMOL – H, U, M, O, L; but L must be 4th, so this is invalid (O is 4th, L must be 4th).

Wait, pattern is _ _ _ L _, so O must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

- 1st: O _ _ L _
  - OMBLY
  - OPILY – O, P, I, L, Y; but L must be 4th, so this would be O P I L Y – L is 4th, Y is 5th. OPILY is a word (variant of opal or a type of fly). Letters: O, P, I, L, Y – none are ruled out. This seems valid.

- 3rd: _ _ O L _
  - C R O L E – but E ruled out.
  - F R O L A – A ruled out.
  - M O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd, but 2nd is invalid.
  - P O K E L – E ruled out.
  - H O N L Y – H, O, N, L, Y; O is 2nd (invalid).
  - B O N L Y – same issue.

- 5th: _ _ _ L O
  - B L O C K – but L is 2nd, must be 4th.
  - C L O C K – L 2nd.
  - M I L O N – L 3rd.
  - F I L M O – L 3rd.
  - P I L A R – L 3rd, A ruled out.
  - G I L D O – D ruled out.
  - V I L L O – L 3rd and 4th, but 4th must be L, so V I L L O has L in 3rd and 4th, which is acceptable for 4th position, but O is 5th. Letters: V, I, L, L, O – none ruled out. This seems valid.

Between OMBLY, OPILY, and VILLO:

- OMBLY: O, M, B, L, Y – all allowed.
- OPILY: O, P, I, L, Y – all allowed.
- VILLO: V, I, L, L, O – all allowed.

- O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 5th).
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.

A valid word with L in 4th and O elsewhere is OMBLY.

Summary of constraints so far:

Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, M, B, Y  
Letters confirmed: L in position 4, O somewhere else (positions 2, 3, or 5)

Available letters (common ones): C, F, G, H, I, K, N, P, U, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 4th position: _ _ _ L _
2. Contains O in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4)
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ L _ : O in 2nd
- _ _ O L _ : O in 3rd
- _ _ _ L O : O in 5th

Looking for common words:

1. _ O _ L _
   - CONOL – not a word
   - COPOL – not a word
   - COLON – but L is 3rd, must be 4th
   - COYOL – already considered
   - FOYAL – not common
   - POLON – not a word
   - VOGEL – E ruled out

2. _ _ O L _
   - H O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd, but 2nd is invalid
   - C H O L E – E ruled out
   - F O O L S – S ruled out
   - N O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd
   - P O K E L – E ruled out
   - P O L Y N – but L is 3rd
   - C O P L A – A ruled out

3. _ _ _ L O
   - F I L O – too short
   - P I L O T – T ruled out
   - C H I L O – not common
   - V I L L O – already considered
   - N I L O – too short
   - G I L O – not a word

Looking at remaining common letters and patterns, the most promising is:

- _ O _ L _ with O in 2nd: we need a word like ?O?L?
  - F O G L Y – but Y ruled out
  - C O G L Y – Y ruled out
  - P O K L Y – Y ruled out
  - H O N L Y – Y ruled out
  - G O N L Y – Y ruled out
  - C O P L Y – Y ruled out

Wait, let's think differently: _ _ O L _ with O in 3rd.

- C H O L E – E ruled out
- F O O L S – S ruled out
- N O O L Y – Y ruled out
- P O K E L – E ruled out

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which should give good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word
- L: - → in the word but wrong position (so L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position)
- A, T, E: x → not in the word

So far we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, A, T, E
- The word contains L, but L is not in position 2.

Next guess should:
1. Include L in a different position (not 2).
2. Use other common letters not yet tested (e.g., R, I, N, O, C, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T, E.

Good candidate words:
- RULER (R, U, L, E, R) – but E is already ruled out.
- CLINK (C, L, I, N, K) – uses L in 2nd position, but we know L is not in 2nd position.
- FLING (F, L, I, N, G) – L in 2nd position again, same issue.
- WORLD (W, O, R, L, D) – L in 4th position (allowed), uses new letters W, O, R, D.

WORLD seems good: it includes L in 4th position (not 2nd), and introduces W, O, R, D which are common and untested.

- R: x → not in the word  
- L: ✓ → in the word and in the correct 4th position  
- D: x → not in the word  

Summary of constraints so far:

Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E, W, R, D  
Letters confirmed: L in position 4, O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but 4 is already L).

Available letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has L in the 4th position: _ _ _ L _
2. Contains O somewhere other than position 2.
3. Uses only the remaining allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- O _ _ L _
- _ O _ L _
- _ _ O L _
- _ _ _ L O

Looking for common words fitting these patterns:

- MOLAR – uses M, O, L, A, R; A and R are ruled out.
- POLYP – uses P, O, L, Y, P; Y is allowed, but we need to check if P is allowed (it hasn’t been ruled out).
- COULD – uses C, O, U, L, D; D is ruled out.
- FOULS – uses F, O, U, L, S; S is ruled out.
- GOLLY – uses G, O, L, L, Y; double L is fine, Y is allowed, no ruled-out letters.

GOLLY fits:
- G, O, L, L, Y – none of the ruled-out letters.
- L is in position 4 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (but feedback said O is in the word but wrong position; position 2 was its position in WORLD, so this is invalid). Oops, O can’t be in position 2.

Let’s try another:
- MOLLY – M, O, L, L, Y. Same issue, O in position 2.

Next:
- YOLKS – Y, O, L, K, S; S is ruled out.

Next:
- JOLLY – J, O, L, L, Y. J hasn’t been ruled out, O is in position 2 (invalid).

Next:
- BOLLY – B, O, L, L, Y. Same O-in-2 issue.

Next:
- FOLLY – F, O, L, L, Y. Same issue.

Next:
- COBOL – C, O, B, O, L. O appears twice; one O must be elsewhere. Positions: C(1), O(2) – but O can’t be in 2.

Next:
- FOYOT – F, O, Y, O, T; T is ruled out.

Next:
- POKAL – P, O, K, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COPAL – C, O, P, A, L; A is ruled out.

Next:
- GOLIA – G, O, L, I, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- POLKA – P, O, L, K, A; A is ruled out.

Next:
- COYOL – C, O, Y, O, L; double O, T is ruled out but not here; positions: O in 2 and 4; 2 is invalid.

Next:
- KNOOL – K, N, O, O, L; double O, O in 3 and 4; 4 is L, so O in 3 is fine, but 4 is L. So K N O L – but that’s 4 letters.

Wait, we need 5-letter words with L in 4th position and O elsewhere (not 2nd).

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O _ _ L _ : O in 1st
   - OMBLY – O, M, B, L, Y. All letters allowed (M, B, Y not ruled out).
   - OCHRE – O, C, H, R, E; R and E ruled out.
   - OPINE – O, P, I, N, E; E ruled out.
   - OPIUM – O, P, I, U, M; U and M allowed.

2. _ O _ L _ : O in 2nd – but feedback says O is in wrong position, and in WORLD it was 2nd, so this is invalid.

3. _ _ O L _ : O in 3rd
   - HUMOL – H, U, M, O, L; but L must be 4th, so this is invalid (O is 4th, L must be 4th).

Wait, pattern is _ _ _ L _, so O must be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

- 1st: O _ _ L _
  - OMBLY
  - OPILY – O, P, I, L, Y; but L must be 4th, so this would be O P I L Y – L is 4th, Y is 5th. OPILY is a word (variant of opal or a type of fly). Letters: O, P, I, L, Y – none are ruled out. This seems valid.

- 3rd: _ _ O L _
  - C R O L E – but E ruled out.
  - F R O L A – A ruled out.
  - M O O L Y – O in 2nd and 3rd, but 2nd is invalid.
  - P O K E L – E ruled out.
  - H O N L Y – H, O, N, L, Y; O is 2nd (invalid).
  - B O N L Y – same issue.

- 5th: _ _ _ L O
  - B L O C K – but L is 2nd, must be 4th.
  - C L O C K – L 2nd.
  - M I L O N – L 3rd.
  - F I L M O – L 3rd.
  - P I L A R – L 3rd, A ruled out.
  - G I L D O – D ruled out.
  - V I L L O – L 3rd and 4th, but 4th must be L, so V I L L O has L in 3rd and 4th, which is acceptable for 4th position, but O is 5th. Letters: V, I, L, L, O – none ruled out. This seems valid.

Between OMBLY, OPILY, and VILLO:

- OMBLY: O, M, B, L, Y – all allowed.
- OPILY: O, P, I, L, Y – all allowed.
- VILLO: V, I, L, L, O – all allowed.

OPILY seems more common (though rare), OMBLY is plausible, VILLO is a word (plural of villa).

Let’s choose OMBLY as it uses common remaining letters.Based on the feedback:
- L is confirmed in the 4th position.
- O is in the word but not in the 2nd position (so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 5th).
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D.

A valid word with L in 4th and O elsewhere is OMBLY.

- C O P L Y – but Y is ruled out
- H O N L Y – Y is ruled out
- P O K E L – E is ruled out

- C H O L E – E ruled out
- F O O L S – S ruled out

Let's parse the new feedback on VILLO:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   V I L L O  
Feedback:  x - - ✓ -

1. V (x) → not in the word  
2. I (-) → in the word but wrong position (so I is present, not in position 2)  
3. L (-) → in the word but wrong position (but we already know L is in position 4, so this must mean this L is in the word elsewhere)  
4. L (✓) → correct position (position 4)  
5. O (-) → in the word but wrong position (so O is present, not in position 5)

Combining all constraints so far:

- Letters locked: L in position 4  
- Letters confirmed present: O, I  
- Letters confirmed absent: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, M, B, Y, V  
- Positions for O and I:  
  – O cannot be in position 2 (from WORLD) or 5 (from VILLO), so O must be in 1 or 3  
  – I cannot be in position 2 (from VILLO), so I must be in 1, 3, or 5  

Available letters (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ _ L _ (L fixed at 4)
- O in 1 or 3
- I in 1, 3, or 5
- No repeated letters unless allowed (but we have only one L confirmed)

Possible patterns:
1. O _ I L _   (O in 1, I in 3)  
2. O I _ L _   (O in 1, I in 2 – but I cannot be in 2) – invalid  
3. _ O I L _   (O in 3, I in 3 – conflict) – invalid

7. I O _ L _   (I in 1, O in 2 – but O cannot be in 2) – invalid  
8. _ I _ L O   – invalid (O in 5)  
9. I _ _ L O   – invalid (O in 5)

Valid patterns left:

- O _ I L _   (O in 1, I in 3)

Common words fitting this:

- O H I L _ – no common word  
- O N I L _ – ONIL? Not a word  
- O P I L _ – OPIL? Not a word  
- O K I L _ – OKIL? Not a word  

Next pattern: I _ O L _ (I in 1, O in 3)

- I N O L Y – Y ruled out  
- I N O L D – D ruled out  
- I N O L K – INOLK? Not a word  
- I N O L G – INOLG? Not a word  
- I N O L F – INOLF? Not a word  

Wait, let’s think of real words:

Looking up 5-letter words with L in 4th, O in 3rd, I in 1st:
- I N O L E – E ruled out  
- I N O L A – A ruled out  
- I N O L Y – Y ruled out  
- I N O L D – D ruled out  

Hmm, none seem to fit. Let’s try O _ I L _ again with remaining letters.

Available letters: C, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, etc.

- O C I L K – OCILK? Not a word  
- O C I L N – OCILN? Not a word  
- O H I L K – OHILK? Not a word  
- O P I L K – OPILK? Not a word

Wait, let’s try O _ _ L _ with O in 1st and see if I can fit I somewhere.

O _ _ L _  
I must be in 3 or 5.

- O _ I L _ – same as before  
- O _ _ L I – I in 5  

Let’s try O _ _ L I (O in 1, I in 5):

Need letters for positions 2 and 3.

Possible common words:
- O N C L I – ONCLI? Not a word  
- O N G L I – ONGLI? Not a word  
- O K L L I – double L, but L is already in 4th, so OKLLI? Not a word  
- O P N L I – OPNLI? Not a word  

This seems difficult. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word may have another L elsewhere, since we only have one L confirmed in position 4. The feedback on VILLO shows two L’s, but only the second one is correct. The first L in VILLO (position 3) is marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3. Since we already have L in position 4, the word could have another L in position 2 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- O L I L _ – but O cannot be in 1 and L in 2, etc.  
- I L O L _ – but O cannot be in 3  
- _ L O L _ – O in 3, L in 2

Possible common words:

None work. Next: _ O L L I (O in 2 – invalid).

Next: _ _ O L I (O in 3, I in 5):

Structure: _ _ O L I

Possible common words:

- N H O L I – NHOLI? Not a word  
- P H O L I – PHOLI? Not a word  
- G H O L I – GHOLI? Not a word  

CHOLI seems valid. Let’s check constraints:
- C, H, O, L, I – none are ruled out except L is already confirmed in 4th.  
- O is in 3 (allowed)  
- I is in 5 (allowed)  
- L is in 4 (confirmed)  

This fits perfectly.

Based on all constraints:

Next: _ _ O L I (O in 3, I in 5):

Structure: _ _ O L I  
Need letters for 1 and 2.

Possible common words:
- C H O L I – CHOLI (a word for a type of dress)  
- F H O L I – FHOLI? Not a word  
- N H O L I – NHOLI? Not a word  
- P H O L I – PHOLI? Not a word  
- G H O L I – GHOLI? Not a word  

CHOLI seems valid. Let’s check constraints:
- C, H, O, L, I – none are ruled out except L is already confirmed in 4th.  
- O is in 3 (allowed)  
- I is in 5 (allowed)  
- L is in 4 (confirmed)  

This fits perfectly.Based on all constraints:
- L is fixed in position 4.  
- O must be in position 1 or 3.  
- I must be in 1, 3, or 5.  
- Ruled-out letters: S, A, T, E, W, R, D, M, B, Y, V.  

A valid word fitting these rules is **CHOLI**.",Guess 5: CHOLI -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) O(✓) L(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
