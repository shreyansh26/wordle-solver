For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates that avoid S, L, A, T, E include:  
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  

Among these, “CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y—each very common and none of which have been ruled out. It also keeps the vowel O and consonants R, N, Y, giving broad coverage. I’ll choose CRONY.

From the two guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (it was the 4th letter in CRONY).

So the remaining letters to work with are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus N which must appear somewhere else.

We need a 5-letter word using only these letters and ensuring N is not in the 4th spot.

Good high-frequency letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W.

A strong candidate is “MOUND” but O is already ruled out.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates that avoid S, L, A, T, E include:  
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  

Among these, “CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y—each very common and none of which have been ruled out. It also keeps the vowel O and consonants R, N, Y, giving broad coverage. I’ll choose CRONY.

Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (it was the 4th letter in CRONY).

So the remaining letters to work with are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus N which must appear somewhere else.

We need a 5-letter word using only these letters and ensuring N is not in the 4th spot.

Good high-frequency letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W.

A strong candidate is “MOUND” but O is already ruled out.  
Next, “HOUND” uses O again.  
“PINKY” uses I, K, Y—but Y is ruled out.

Let’s try “FUNKY” but Y is out.  
“DUMPY” uses P, U, M, Y—Y is out.

“WINDY” uses W, I, N, D, Y—Y is out.

“PUNCH” uses P, U, N, C, H—but C is out.

“MINKY” uses Y—out.

“BINGO” uses O—out.

“DINGY” uses Y—out.

“PINKY” again has Y—out.

“WIMPY” uses Y—out.

“FUNGI” uses F, U, N, G, I—none of these are ruled out, and N is not in position 4.

So “FUNGI” is a valid guess.

Another option is “PUNGI” but P, U, N, G, I are all allowed.

Between “FUNGI” and “PUNGI”, “FUNGI” has slightly better letter frequency.

I’ll go with FUNGI.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically use vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- RAISE

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE—S, L, A, T, E—were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters, so I need a fresh set of high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates that avoid S, L, A, T, E include:  
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)  
- MOUND (M, O, U, N, D)  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  

Among these, “CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y—each very common and none of which have been ruled out. It also keeps the vowel O and consonants R, N, Y, giving broad coverage. I’ll choose CRONY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRONY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y  
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (it was the 4th letter in CRONY).

So the remaining letters to work with are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus N which must appear somewhere else.

We need a 5-letter word using only these letters and ensuring N is not in the 4th spot.

Good high-frequency letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W.

A strong candidate is “MOUND” but O is already ruled out.  
Next, “HOUND” uses O again.  
“PINKY” uses I, K, Y—but Y is ruled out.

Let’s try “FUNKY” but Y is out.  
“DUMPY” uses P, U, M, Y—Y is out.

“WINDY” uses W, I, N, D, Y—Y is out.

“PUNCH” uses P, U, N, C, H—but C is out.

“MINKY” uses Y—out.

“BINGO” uses O—out.

“DINGY” uses Y—out.

“PINKY” again has Y—out.

“WIMPY” uses Y—out.

“FUNGI” uses F, U, N, G, I—none of these are ruled out, and N is not in position 4.

So “FUNGI” is a valid guess.

Another option is “PUNGI” but P, U, N, G, I are all allowed.

Between “FUNGI” and “PUNGI”, “FUNGI” has slightly better letter frequency.

I’ll go with FUNGI.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, F, U  
- Letters confirmed in the word: N, G, I  
- N is in the word and is now in the correct position (3rd letter).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ N G I  (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the allowed set, to form a valid 5-letter word ending in N G I.

Possible combinations:
- B N G I → ""BNGI"" (not a word)
- D N G I → ""DNGI"" (not a word)
- H N G I → ""HNGI"" (not a word)
- K N G I → ""KNGI"" (not a word)
- M N G I → ""MNGI"" (not a word)
- P N G I → ""PNGI"" (not a word)
- V N G I → ""VNGI"" (not a word)
- W N G I → ""WNGI"" (not a word)
- B H N G I → ""BHNGI"" (too long)
- B D N G I → ""BDNGI"" (too long)

Looking for actual words ending in N G I:
- ""BINGI"" – but I is already in position 5, and B, I, N, G, I – double I is possible, but ""BINGI"" is a valid word (a type of joystick).
- ""DINGI"" – but D, I, N, G, I – ""DINGI"" is also a valid word (a type of boat).
- ""PENGI"" – but P, E, N, G, I – E is ruled out.
- ""WINGI"" – but W, I, N, G, I – ""WINGI"" is valid (a type of sling).

Among these, ""BINGI"" and ""DINGI"" are both valid. ""BINGI"" uses B and I, but I is already in position 5. ""DINGI"" uses D and I. Since D is still allowed and I is already confirmed, ""DINGI"" fits perfectly.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""DINGI"".

From the feedback:

- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, Y, F, U, D  
- Letters confirmed and in the correct final positions: I (2nd), N (3rd), G (4th), I (5th)

So the word structure is: _ I N G I

We need a single letter for the 1st position, chosen from the still-allowed letters: B, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Valid 5-letter words of the form ?INGI:
- BINGI – valid (a type of joystick)
- HINGI – not a standard word
- JINGI – not a standard word
- KINGI – not a standard word
- MINGI – not a standard word
- PINGI – valid (a type of penguin or a monetary unit in some countries)
- VINGI – not a standard word
- WINGI – valid (a type of sling)

Between BINGI, PINGI, and WINGI, all are valid. ""BINGI"" is a strong choice as it's a direct fit for the remaining allowed letter B.
