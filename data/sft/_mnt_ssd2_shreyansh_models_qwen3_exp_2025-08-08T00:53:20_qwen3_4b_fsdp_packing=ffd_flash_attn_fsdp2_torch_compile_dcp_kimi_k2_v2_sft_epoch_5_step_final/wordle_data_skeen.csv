### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- E is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- N is in the correct position (5th letter).
- T and I are not in the word.

So the secret word has the form:
S _ E _ N

Letters already confirmed: S, E, N in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I.

Remaining letters to consider for positions 2 and 4 (from the alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need to find 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ E _ N. Some possibilities:
- S B E D N
- S C E L N
- S D E N N
- S H E L N
- S K E L N
- S L E D N
- S P E C N
- S W E L N
- S Y E L N

Looking at these, ""SHELF"" comes to mind, but F is allowed and it fits S _ E _ N. However, ""SHELF"" has F in position 4, which is allowed. But let me check if ""SHELF"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another good candidate is ""SKELE"" but that's not a common word. ""SHELF"" seems best as it's common and uses allowed letters.

Wait, let me double-check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (position 2) - not yet ruled out
- E (position 3) ✓
- L (position 4) - not yet ruled out
- F (position 5) - not yet ruled out

But position 5 must be N, not F. My mistake - the word must end with N. So the pattern is S _ E _ N.

Looking again:
- S B E D N - ""SBEDN"" - not a word
- S C E L N - ""SCLN"" - no
- S D E N N - ""SDENN"" - no
- S H E L N - ""SHELLN"" - no
- S K E L N - ""SKELN"" - no
- S L E D N - ""SLEDN"" - no
- S P E C N - ""SPECN"" - no
- S W E L N - ""SWelln"" - no
- S Y E L N - ""SYELN"" - no

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think differently - maybe ""SLEPT"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" has T ruled out. 

Wait, ""SLEEP"" has P in position 4, but position 5 must be N. 

Looking at actual English words fitting S _ E _ N:
- ""SHEEN"" - but that has double E, and position 3 is already E.
- ""SWEEN"" - no
- ""SLEEN"" - no
- ""SPREEN"" - too long
- ""SKEEN"" - no
- ""SHYEN"" - no

Actually, ""SHEEN"" is a valid word meaning a gleam or shimmer, and it fits S _ E _ N:
- S H E E N

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E - but the original word has E in position 3 from feedback, so position 4 could be E. However, in STEIN, E was in position 3 and marked ✓, so position 3 is definitely E. Position 4 could be E, but that would make ""SHEEN"".

But let me check if ""SHEEN"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another possibility is ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" is invalid because T is out.

""SNELL"" - but L is in position 4, N is in position 5, but we have N already in position 5 from STEIN feedback. So ""SNELL"" would have N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Wait, the word must have N in position 5 only. So ""SNELL"" is invalid because it has N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Looking again, ""SHEEN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with common letters. Let me confirm:
- S H E E N
- Positions: 1:S ✓, 3:E ✓, 5:N ✓
- Letters used: S, H, E, N - all allowed
- No ruled-out letters (A,R,O,T,I) are used

Thus, ""SHEEN"" is the best next guess.

Based on the feedback:
- S is correctly placed in position 1
- E is correctly placed in position 3
- N is correctly placed in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O are already ruled out

The word must be of the form S _ E _ N. The only common English word fitting this pattern is:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- E is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- N is in the correct position (5th letter).
- T and I are not in the word.

So the secret word has the form:
S _ E _ N

Letters already confirmed: S, E, N in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I.

Remaining letters to consider for positions 2 and 4 (from the alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need to find 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ E _ N. Some possibilities:
- S B E D N
- S C E L N
- S D E N N
- S H E L N
- S K E L N
- S L E D N
- S P E C N
- S W E L N
- S Y E L N

Looking at these, ""SHELF"" comes to mind, but F is allowed and it fits S _ E _ N. However, ""SHELF"" has F in position 4, which is allowed. But let me check if ""SHELF"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another good candidate is ""SKELE"" but that's not a common word. ""SHELF"" seems best as it's common and uses allowed letters.

Wait, let me double-check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (position 2) - not yet ruled out
- E (position 3) ✓
- L (position 4) - not yet ruled out
- F (position 5) - not yet ruled out

But position 5 must be N, not F. My mistake - the word must end with N. So the pattern is S _ E _ N.

Looking again:
- S B E D N - ""SBEDN"" - not a word
- S C E L N - ""SCLN"" - no
- S D E N N - ""SDENN"" - no
- S H E L N - ""SHELLN"" - no
- S K E L N - ""SKELN"" - no
- S L E D N - ""SLEDN"" - no
- S P E C N - ""SPECN"" - no
- S W E L N - ""SWelln"" - no
- S Y E L N - ""SYELN"" - no

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think differently - maybe ""SLEPT"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" has T ruled out. 

Wait, ""SLEEP"" has P in position 4, but position 5 must be N. 

Looking at actual English words fitting S _ E _ N:
- ""SHEEN"" - but that has double E, and position 3 is already E.
- ""SWEEN"" - no
- ""SLEEN"" - no
- ""SPREEN"" - too long
- ""SKEEN"" - no
- ""SHYEN"" - no

Actually, ""SHEEN"" is a valid word meaning a gleam or shimmer, and it fits S _ E _ N:
- S H E E N

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E - but the original word has E in position 3 from feedback, so position 4 could be E. However, in STEIN, E was in position 3 and marked ✓, so position 3 is definitely E. Position 4 could be E, but that would make ""SHEEN"".

But let me check if ""SHEEN"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another possibility is ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" is invalid because T is out.

""SNELL"" - but L is in position 4, N is in position 5, but we have N already in position 5 from STEIN feedback. So ""SNELL"" would have N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Wait, the word must have N in position 5 only. So ""SNELL"" is invalid because it has N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Looking again, ""SHEEN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with common letters. Let me confirm:
- S H E E N
- Positions: 1:S ✓, 3:E ✓, 5:N ✓
- Letters used: S, H, E, N - all allowed
- No ruled-out letters (A,R,O,T,I) are used

Thus, ""SHEEN"" is the best next guess.Based on the feedback:
- S is correctly placed in position 1
- E is correctly placed in position 3
- N is correctly placed in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O are already ruled out

The word must be of the form S _ E _ N. The only common English word fitting this pattern is:

However, the pattern S _ E E N with no H is only satisfied by ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. This suggests the only possible word is ""SLEEN"" which is not valid. 

Rechecking: The correct valid word is ""SHEEN"" but we've already used it. This implies the word must be ""SLEET"" but T is out. 

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word fitting S _ E E N is ""SHEEN"", but it was already used. This suggests the word must be ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. 

This indicates an inconsistency, meaning the word must be ""SHEEN"" and we must have made an error. However, since SHEEN was already tried, the only remaining possibility is ""SLEET"" but T is out. 

Realizing the oversight: The word must be ""SHEEN"" and we must have H in the wrong position. But H was ruled out. 

Re-evaluating: The correct word must be ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. This suggests the word is ""SWEEN"" but W is allowed. 

Checking ""SWEEN"":
- S W E E N
- Letters: S, W, E, N - all allowed
- Pattern matches S _ E E N

Thus, ""SWEEN"" is the next valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S and E in different positions than 4 and 5.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let me pick a word that satisfies these constraints. ""STEIN"" is a good candidate:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).
- E is in position 2 (different from position 5 in AROSE).
- Contains no A, R, or O.
- Uses common letters T and N to gather more information.

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- E is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- N is in the correct position (5th letter).
- T and I are not in the word.

So the secret word has the form:
S _ E _ N

Letters already confirmed: S, E, N in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I.

Remaining letters to consider for positions 2 and 4 (from the alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need to find 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ E _ N. Some possibilities:
- S B E D N
- S C E L N
- S D E N N
- S H E L N
- S K E L N
- S L E D N
- S P E C N
- S W E L N
- S Y E L N

Looking at these, ""SHELF"" comes to mind, but F is allowed and it fits S _ E _ N. However, ""SHELF"" has F in position 4, which is allowed. But let me check if ""SHELF"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another good candidate is ""SKELE"" but that's not a common word. ""SHELF"" seems best as it's common and uses allowed letters.

Wait, let me double-check:
- S (position 1) ✓
- H (position 2) - not yet ruled out
- E (position 3) ✓
- L (position 4) - not yet ruled out
- F (position 5) - not yet ruled out

But position 5 must be N, not F. My mistake - the word must end with N. So the pattern is S _ E _ N.

Looking again:
- S B E D N - ""SBEDN"" - not a word
- S C E L N - ""SCLN"" - no
- S D E N N - ""SDENN"" - no
- S H E L N - ""SHELLN"" - no
- S K E L N - ""SKELN"" - no
- S L E D N - ""SLEDN"" - no
- S P E C N - ""SPECN"" - no
- S W E L N - ""SWelln"" - no
- S Y E L N - ""SYELN"" - no

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think differently - maybe ""SLEPT"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" has T ruled out. 

Wait, ""SLEEP"" has P in position 4, but position 5 must be N. 

Looking at actual English words fitting S _ E _ N:
- ""SHEEN"" - but that has double E, and position 3 is already E.
- ""SWEEN"" - no
- ""SLEEN"" - no
- ""SPREEN"" - too long
- ""SKEEN"" - no
- ""SHYEN"" - no

Actually, ""SHEEN"" is a valid word meaning a gleam or shimmer, and it fits S _ E _ N:
- S H E E N

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E - but the original word has E in position 3 from feedback, so position 4 could be E. However, in STEIN, E was in position 3 and marked ✓, so position 3 is definitely E. Position 4 could be E, but that would make ""SHEEN"".

But let me check if ""SHEEN"" is valid - yes, it is.

Another possibility is ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" is invalid because T is out.

""SNELL"" - but L is in position 4, N is in position 5, but we have N already in position 5 from STEIN feedback. So ""SNELL"" would have N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Wait, the word must have N in position 5 only. So ""SNELL"" is invalid because it has N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.

Looking again, ""SHEEN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with common letters. Let me confirm:
- S H E E N
- Positions: 1:S ✓, 3:E ✓, 5:N ✓
- Letters used: S, H, E, N - all allowed
- No ruled-out letters (A,R,O,T,I) are used

- S is correctly placed in position 1
- E is correctly placed in position 3
- N is correctly placed in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O are already ruled out

This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).\n- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.\n- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n1.

""STEIN"" is a good candidate:\n- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in AROSE).\n- E is in position 2 (different from position 5 in AROSE).\n- Contains no A, R, or O.\n- Uses common letters T and N to gather more information.\n\n<guess>STEIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(✓) I(x) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on STEIN:\n- S is in the correct position (1st letter).\n- E is in the correct position (3rd letter).\n- N is in the correct position (5th letter).\n- T and I are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word has the form:\nS _ E _ N\n\nLetters already confirmed: S, E, N in positions 1, 3, 5 respectively.\n\nLetters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, I.\n\nRemaining letters to consider for positions 2 and 4 (from the alphabet, excluding the ruled-out letters): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nI need to find 5-letter words that fit the pattern S _ E _ N. Some possibilities:\n- S B E D N\n- S C E L N\n- S D E N N\n- S H E L N\n- S K E L N\n- S L E D N\n- S P E C N\n- S W E L N\n- S Y E L N\n\nLooking at these, ""SHELF"" comes to mind, but F is allowed and it fits S _ E _ N. However, ""SHELF"" has F in position 4, which is allowed. But let me check if ""SHELF"" is valid - yes, it is.\n\nAnother good candidate is ""SKELE"" but that\'s not a common word. ""SHELF"" seems best as it\'s common and uses allowed letters.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n- S (position 1) ✓\n- H (position 2) - not yet ruled out\n- E (position 3) ✓\n- L (position 4) - not yet ruled out\n- F (position 5) - not yet ruled out\n\nBut position 5 must be N, not F. My mistake - the word must end with N. So the pattern is S _ E _ N.\n\nLooking again:\n- S B E D N - ""SBEDN"" - not a word\n- S C E L N - ""SCLN"" - no\n- S D E N N - ""SDENN"" - no\n- S H E L N - ""SHELLN"" - no\n- S K E L N - ""SKELN"" - no\n- S L E D N - ""SLEDN"" - no\n- S P E C N - ""SPECN"" - no\n- S W E L N - ""SWelln"" - no\n- S Y E L N - ""SYELN"" - no\n\nHmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think differently - maybe ""SLEPT"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" has T ruled out. \n\nWait, ""SLEEP"" has P in position 4, but position 5 must be N. \n\nLooking at actual English words fitting S _ E _ N:\n- ""SHEEN"" - but that has double E, and position 3 is already E.\n- ""SWEEN"" - no\n- ""SLEEN"" - no\n- ""SPREEN"" - too long\n- ""SKEEN"" - no\n- ""SHYEN"" - no\n\nActually, ""SHEEN"" is a valid word meaning a gleam or shimmer, and it fits S _ E _ N:\n- S H E E N\n\nBut position 3 is E, and position 4 is E - but the original word has E in position 3 from feedback, so position 4 could be E. However, in STEIN, E was in position 3 and marked ✓, so position 3 is definitely E. Position 4 could be E, but that would make ""SHEEN"".\n\nBut let me check if ""SHEEN"" is valid - yes, it is.\n\nAnother possibility is ""SLEET"" but T is ruled out. ""SLEET"" is invalid because T is out.\n\n""SNELL"" - but L is in position 4, N is in position 5, but we have N already in position 5 from STEIN feedback. So ""SNELL"" would have N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.\n\nWait, the word must have N in position 5 only. So ""SNELL"" is invalid because it has N in position 2 and 5, but our word has N only in position 5.\n\nLooking again, ""SHEEN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with common letters.
