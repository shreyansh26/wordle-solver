For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in the first position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded entirely.
3. We still have four unknown positions to fill with letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Keeps the A (since we know it’s in the word) but moves it to a different position (2-5).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet (avoid R,O,S,E).
- Covers other common letters to maximize information.

Popular untested letters include T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced choice is “TAINT”:
- T is common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.
- I and N are also common and untested.
- The second T gives us info on whether T repeats.

Alternative could be “PAINT” or “CAINT”, but “TAINT” seems slightly better due to T’s frequency.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
Letter T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.

So far the confirmed letters are: A and T, and they must appear in the remaining open positions: 3, 4, or 5 for A; 2 or 4 for T.

We also know we still need three more distinct letters (since no duplicates have been hinted at).  
Available common letters we haven’t tried: L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, W, V.

Let’s build a word that:
- Places A in position 3, 4 or 5 (positions 1 & 2 are ruled out).
- Places T in position 2 or 4 (positions 1, 3, 5 are ruled out).
- Uses three new letters from the available pool, avoiding the excluded ones.

A good candidate is “CATTY”:
- C, Y are new letters.
- T appears twice (positions 2 & 3), which is allowed unless proven otherwise.
- A would be in position 4 (allowed).
- However, we have no evidence that T repeats, so we should avoid forced duplicates.

Better: “MADLY”
- M, D, L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 → but we know A is NOT in position 2 (from TAINT feedback).
So “MADLY” is invalid.

Next try: “PLANT” – but N is excluded.

- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 → again invalid.

Possible positions for T: 2,4  

Case 1: A in 3, T in 2 → pattern _ T A _ _
Letters left to fill: positions 1,4,5 from available pool.

Example: C T U M A – not a word.

Case 6: A in 5, T in 4 → pattern _ _ _ T A
Example: C U M T A – not a word.

Let’s pick a valid English word that fits the constraints:

Pattern _ T _ A _ with valid letters:

Pattern _ _ A T _:

- P, L, Y are new.
- P L A T Y – yes, this is a valid word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

- I and N are also common and untested.
- The second T gives us info on whether T repeats.

Alternative could be “PAINT” or “CAINT”, but “TAINT” seems slightly better due to T’s frequency.

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
Letter T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.

So far the confirmed letters are: A and T, and they must appear in the remaining open positions: 3, 4, or 5 for A; 2 or 4 for T.

We also know we still need three more distinct letters (since no duplicates have been hinted at).  
Available common letters we haven’t tried: L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, W, V.

Let’s build a word that:
- Places A in position 3, 4 or 5 (positions 1 & 2 are ruled out).
- Places T in position 2 or 4 (positions 1, 3, 5 are ruled out).
- Uses three new letters from the available pool, avoiding the excluded ones.

A good candidate is “CATTY”:
- C, Y are new letters.
- T appears twice (positions 2 & 3), which is allowed unless proven otherwise.
- A would be in position 4 (allowed).
- However, we have no evidence that T repeats, so we should avoid forced duplicates.

Better: “MADLY”
- M, D, L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 → but we know A is NOT in position 2 (from TAINT feedback).
So “MADLY” is invalid.

Next try: “PLANT” – but N is excluded.

Next try: “GAMUT”
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 → again invalid.

Next try: “BATCH”
- B, C, H are new.
- A in position 2 → invalid.

Next try: “TACET” – but E is excluded.

Next try: “TULIP” – I and P; I excluded.

Next try: “TALUK” – U, K; but A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TABBY” – B, B, Y; A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TALUK” already considered.

Let’s systematically list positions:

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  
Possible positions for T: 2,4  

Case 1: A in 3, T in 2 → pattern _ T A _ _
Letters left to fill: positions 1,4,5 from available pool.
Example: C T A M B → “CTAMB” – not a word.

Case 2: A in 3, T in 4 → pattern _ _ A T _
Example: L U A T Y – not a word.

Case 3: A in 4, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ A _
Example: C T U A M – not a word.

Case 4: A in 4, T in 4 – impossible, T and A can’t both be in 4.

Case 5: A in 5, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ _ A
Example: C T U M A – not a word.

Case 6: A in 5, T in 4 → pattern _ _ _ T A
Example: C U M T A – not a word.

Let’s pick a valid English word that fits the constraints:

Pattern _ T _ A _ with valid letters:
- C, U, M, Y: C T U A Y – not a word.
- L, U, M, Y: L T U M Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ A T _:
- L, U, M, Y: L U A T Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ _ T A:
- L, U, M, Y: L U M T A – not a word.

Let’s try “GULAT” – not valid.

Try “PLATY”:
- P, L, Y are new.
- P L A T Y – yes, this is a valid word.
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- T in position 4 (allowed).
- P, L, Y are new and valid.

So “PLATY” is a good next guess.

From the new feedback on PLATY:

- P, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, T
- T is fixed in position 4.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from previous feedback: A(-) in AROSE, A(-) in TAINT, A(-) in PLATY). Therefore A must be in position 3. But PLATY's feedback says A(-) (wrong position), and position 3 is where A was in PLATY, so A cannot be in position 3 either. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- TAINT: A(-) means A is in word but not position 2.
- PLATY: A(-) means A is in word but not position 3.

So A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already T, so A must be in position 5.

Thus:
- T is in position 4 (✓ from PLATY).
- A must be in position 5.
- Letters left to determine: positions 1, 2, 3.
- Available letters (not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones).

We need three distinct letters from the available pool for positions 1, 2, 3, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending with ""TA"" (since T is 4th and A is 5th). But T is 4th and A is 5th, so the pattern is _ _ _ T A.

Valid words ending with ""TA"":
- CATTY – but Y is excluded.
- HATTA – but T is already in 4th, and this has double T.
- LATTE – L excluded.
- METTA – M, E, T, T, A – E excluded, double T possible but not sure.
- VENOM – ends with OM.
- BAGEL – ends with EL.
- FUGUE – ends with UE.
- JOKER – ends with ER.
- KNEEL – ends with EL.
- MURKY – ends with Y.
- QUART – ends with T but needs to fit _ _ _ T A.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in the first position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded entirely.
3. We still have four unknown positions to fill with letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Keeps the A (since we know it’s in the word) but moves it to a different position (2-5).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet (avoid R,O,S,E).
- Covers other common letters to maximize information.

Popular untested letters include T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced choice is “TAINT”:
- T is common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.
- I and N are also common and untested.
- The second T gives us info on whether T repeats.

Alternative could be “PAINT” or “CAINT”, but “TAINT” seems slightly better due to T’s frequency.

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
Letter T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.

So far the confirmed letters are: A and T, and they must appear in the remaining open positions: 3, 4, or 5 for A; 2 or 4 for T.

We also know we still need three more distinct letters (since no duplicates have been hinted at).  
Available common letters we haven’t tried: L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, W, V.

Let’s build a word that:
- Places A in position 3, 4 or 5 (positions 1 & 2 are ruled out).
- Places T in position 2 or 4 (positions 1, 3, 5 are ruled out).
- Uses three new letters from the available pool, avoiding the excluded ones.

A good candidate is “CATTY”:
- C, Y are new letters.
- T appears twice (positions 2 & 3), which is allowed unless proven otherwise.
- A would be in position 4 (allowed).
- However, we have no evidence that T repeats, so we should avoid forced duplicates.

Better: “MADLY”
- M, D, L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 → but we know A is NOT in position 2 (from TAINT feedback).
So “MADLY” is invalid.

Next try: “PLANT” – but N is excluded.

Next try: “GAMUT”
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 → again invalid.

Next try: “BATCH”
- B, C, H are new.
- A in position 2 → invalid.

Next try: “TACET” – but E is excluded.

Next try: “TULIP” – I and P; I excluded.

Next try: “TALUK” – U, K; but A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TABBY” – B, B, Y; A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TALUK” already considered.

Let’s systematically list positions:

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  
Possible positions for T: 2,4  

Case 1: A in 3, T in 2 → pattern _ T A _ _
Letters left to fill: positions 1,4,5 from available pool.
Example: C T A M B → “CTAMB” – not a word.

Case 2: A in 3, T in 4 → pattern _ _ A T _
Example: L U A T Y – not a word.

Case 3: A in 4, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ A _
Example: C T U A M – not a word.

Case 4: A in 4, T in 4 – impossible, T and A can’t both be in 4.

Case 5: A in 5, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ _ A
Example: C T U M A – not a word.

Case 6: A in 5, T in 4 → pattern _ _ _ T A
Example: C U M T A – not a word.

Let’s pick a valid English word that fits the constraints:

Pattern _ T _ A _ with valid letters:
- C, U, M, Y: C T U A Y – not a word.
- L, U, M, Y: L T U M Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ A T _:
- L, U, M, Y: L U A T Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ _ T A:
- L, U, M, Y: L U M T A – not a word.

Let’s try “GULAT” – not valid.

Try “PLATY”:
- P, L, Y are new.
- P L A T Y – yes, this is a valid word.
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- T in position 4 (allowed).
- P, L, Y are new and valid.

So “PLATY” is a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: PLATY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLATY:

- P, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, T
- T is fixed in position 4.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from previous feedback: A(-) in AROSE, A(-) in TAINT, A(-) in PLATY). Therefore A must be in position 3. But PLATY's feedback says A(-) (wrong position), and position 3 is where A was in PLATY, so A cannot be in position 3 either. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- TAINT: A(-) means A is in word but not position 2.
- PLATY: A(-) means A is in word but not position 3.

So A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already T, so A must be in position 5.

Thus:
- T is in position 4 (✓ from PLATY).
- A must be in position 5.
- Letters left to determine: positions 1, 2, 3.
- Available letters (not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones).

We need three distinct letters from the available pool for positions 1, 2, 3, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending with ""TA"" (since T is 4th and A is 5th). But T is 4th and A is 5th, so the pattern is _ _ _ T A.

Valid words ending with ""TA"":
- CATTY – but Y is excluded.
- HATTA – but T is already in 4th, and this has double T.
- LATTE – L excluded.
- METTA – M, E, T, T, A – E excluded, double T possible but not sure.
- VENOM – ends with OM.
- BAGEL – ends with EL.
- FUGUE – ends with UE.
- JOKER – ends with ER.
- KNEEL – ends with EL.
- MURKY – ends with Y.
- QUART – ends with T but needs to fit _ _ _ T A.

Wait, we need _ _ _ T A.

Let me list possible words:
- CUBTA – not valid.
- DUMTA – not valid.
- FUMTA – not valid.
- GUMTA – not valid.
- MUTTA – not valid.
- CUTTA – not valid.
- BUNTA – not valid.
- DUNTA – not valid.
- FUNTA – not valid.
- GUNTA – not valid.
- HUNTA – not valid.
- JUNTA – yes! JUNTA is a valid word meaning a group of people in authority.

Check letters:
- J, U, N, T, A.
- N was excluded from TAINT feedback (N(x)), so N is NOT in the word. Thus JUNTA is invalid because it contains N.

- KUNTA – not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' which is very common. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but A is NOT in the first position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are excluded entirely.
3. We still have four unknown positions to fill with letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good next step is to pick a word that:
- Keeps the A (since we know it’s in the word) but moves it to a different position (2-5).
- Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet (avoid R,O,S,E).
- Covers other common letters to maximize information.

Popular untested letters include T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced choice is “TAINT”:
- T is common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.
- I and N are also common and untested.
- The second T gives us info on whether T repeats.

Alternative could be “PAINT” or “CAINT”, but “TAINT” seems slightly better due to T’s frequency.

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N  
Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
Letter T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5.

So far the confirmed letters are: A and T, and they must appear in the remaining open positions: 3, 4, or 5 for A; 2 or 4 for T.

We also know we still need three more distinct letters (since no duplicates have been hinted at).  
Available common letters we haven’t tried: L, C, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, F, W, V.

Let’s build a word that:
- Places A in position 3, 4 or 5 (positions 1 & 2 are ruled out).
- Places T in position 2 or 4 (positions 1, 3, 5 are ruled out).
- Uses three new letters from the available pool, avoiding the excluded ones.

A good candidate is “CATTY”:
- C, Y are new letters.
- T appears twice (positions 2 & 3), which is allowed unless proven otherwise.
- A would be in position 4 (allowed).
- However, we have no evidence that T repeats, so we should avoid forced duplicates.

Better: “MADLY”
- M, D, L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 → but we know A is NOT in position 2 (from TAINT feedback).
So “MADLY” is invalid.

Next try: “PLANT” – but N is excluded.

Next try: “GAMUT”
- G, M, U are new.
- A in position 2 → again invalid.

Next try: “BATCH”
- B, C, H are new.
- A in position 2 → invalid.

Next try: “TACET” – but E is excluded.

Next try: “TULIP” – I and P; I excluded.

Next try: “TALUK” – U, K; but A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TABBY” – B, B, Y; A in position 2 invalid.

Next try: “TALUK” already considered.

Let’s systematically list positions:

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5  
Possible positions for T: 2,4  

Case 1: A in 3, T in 2 → pattern _ T A _ _
Letters left to fill: positions 1,4,5 from available pool.
Example: C T A M B → “CTAMB” – not a word.

Case 2: A in 3, T in 4 → pattern _ _ A T _
Example: L U A T Y – not a word.

Case 3: A in 4, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ A _
Example: C T U A M – not a word.

Case 4: A in 4, T in 4 – impossible, T and A can’t both be in 4.

Case 5: A in 5, T in 2 → pattern _ T _ _ A
Example: C T U M A – not a word.

Case 6: A in 5, T in 4 → pattern _ _ _ T A
Example: C U M T A – not a word.

Let’s pick a valid English word that fits the constraints:

Pattern _ T _ A _ with valid letters:
- C, U, M, Y: C T U A Y – not a word.
- L, U, M, Y: L T U M Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ A T _:
- L, U, M, Y: L U A T Y – not a word.

Pattern _ _ _ T A:
- L, U, M, Y: L U M T A – not a word.

Let’s try “GULAT” – not valid.

Try “PLATY”:
- P, L, Y are new.
- P L A T Y – yes, this is a valid word.
- A in position 3 (allowed).
- T in position 4 (allowed).
- P, L, Y are new and valid.

So “PLATY” is a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: PLATY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PLATY:

- P, L, Y are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- T is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, T
- T is fixed in position 4.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from previous feedback: A(-) in AROSE, A(-) in TAINT, A(-) in PLATY). Therefore A must be in position 3. But PLATY's feedback says A(-) (wrong position), and position 3 is where A was in PLATY, so A cannot be in position 3 either. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- AROSE: A(-) means A is in word but not position 1.
- TAINT: A(-) means A is in word but not position 2.
- PLATY: A(-) means A is in word but not position 3.

So A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already T, so A must be in position 5.

Thus:
- T is in position 4 (✓ from PLATY).
- A must be in position 5.
- Letters left to determine: positions 1, 2, 3.
- Available letters (not yet excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want common ones).

We need three distinct letters from the available pool for positions 1, 2, 3, and the word must be valid.

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending with ""TA"" (since T is 4th and A is 5th). But T is 4th and A is 5th, so the pattern is _ _ _ T A.

Valid words ending with ""TA"":
- CATTY – but Y is excluded.
- HATTA – but T is already in 4th, and this has double T.
- LATTE – L excluded.
- METTA – M, E, T, T, A – E excluded, double T possible but not sure.
- VENOM – ends with OM.
- BAGEL – ends with EL.
- FUGUE – ends with UE.
- JOKER – ends with ER.
- KNEEL – ends with EL.
- MURKY – ends with Y.
- QUART – ends with T but needs to fit _ _ _ T A.

Wait, we need _ _ _ T A.

Let me list possible words:
- CUBTA – not valid.
- DUMTA – not valid.
- FUMTA – not valid.
- GUMTA – not valid.
- MUTTA – not valid.
- CUTTA – not valid.
- BUNTA – not valid.
- DUNTA – not valid.
- FUNTA – not valid.
- GUNTA – not valid.
- HUNTA – not valid.
- JUNTA – yes! JUNTA is a valid word meaning a group of people in authority.

Check letters:
- J, U, N, T, A.
- N was excluded from TAINT feedback (N(x)), so N is NOT in the word. Thus JUNTA is invalid because it contains N.

Next:
- KUNTA – not valid.
- LUNTA – L excluded.
- MUNTA – not valid.
- PUNTA – P excluded.
- SUNTA – not valid.
- TUNTA – not valid.
- VUNTA – not valid.
- WUNTA – not valid.
- XUNTA – not valid.
- YUNTA – Y excluded.
- ZUNTA – not valid.

Next possible pattern: _ _ _ T A with remaining letters.

- G, U, X, T, A → GUXTA – not valid.
- H, U, X, T, A → HUXTA – not valid.
- J, U, X, T, A → JUXTA – this is valid! JUXTA is a word meaning to place side by side.

Check letters:
- J, U, X, T, A.
- X is allowed (not excluded).
- All other letters are allowed.

Thus, ""JUXTA"" is a valid next guess.From the feedback so far:
- T is confirmed in position 4.
- A must be in position 5 (it cannot be in 1,2,3, or 4).
- Letters not in the word: R,O,S,E,I,N,P,L,Y.
- Remaining usable letters: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

The pattern is _ _ _ T A.  
The only common word fitting this with the allowed letters is JUXTA.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
Guess 3: PLATY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(✓) Y(x)

From the latest feedback:

- J(x) – J is not in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).
- X(x) – X is not in the word.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and already in the correct position (position 4).
- A(✓) – A is in the word and already in the correct position (position 5).

So the word now looks like: _ U _ T A

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all feedback so far):
R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y, J, X

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (from the alphabet excluding the above):
B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? U ? T A.

Looking at common words:
- B U T T A – invalid (double T, but T is already fixed at position 4)
- C U B T A – not valid
- C U D T A – not valid
- C U F T A – not valid
- C U G T A – not valid
- C U H T A – not valid
- C U K T A – not valid
- C U M T A – not valid
- D U C T A – valid word meaning a type of duct or a unit of measurement
- F U C T A – not valid
- G U M T A – not valid
- H U M T A – not valid
- K U B T A – not valid
- M U C T A – not valid
- V U C T A – not valid
- W U C T A – not valid
- Z U C T A – not valid

The only valid word in this pattern is DUCTA.

Let's verify:
- D, U, C, T, A
- All letters are allowed (none are in the excluded list)
- U, T, A are confirmed in their positions
- D and C haven't been tested yet, but they're allowed

Thus, DUCTA is the logical next guess.

From the new feedback on DUCTA:

- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.
- U(✓) – U is correct in position 2.
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- T(✓) – T is correct in position 4.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 5.

So the word must be: ? U ? T A

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (all previous exclusions plus D and C):
R, O, S, E, I, N, P, L, Y, J, X, D, C

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3:
B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? U ? T A.

Looking at the remaining letters:
- B U B T A – not valid
- B U F T A – not valid

- Z U G T A – not valid
- Z U K T A – not valid
- Z U M T A – not valid

The only remaining valid word in this pattern is BUGTA, but that's not a standard word. However, ""BUTTA"" is a valid word (a type of fruit or a colloquial term), but it's not in common dictionaries. 

Rechecking the remaining letters and valid words, the only plausible candidate is ""BUTTA"" (using B for position 1 and position 3), but since position 3 can't be B (as it would repeat B and we have no evidence of duplicates), this seems invalid.

Wait, let's re-examine the remaining letters more carefully. The pattern is ? U ? T A, and we need to find a valid word. The letters left are B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, V, W, Z.

Looking at these, the only possible valid word is ""BUTTA"" (B U T T A), but this has T in position 3 which conflicts with T already in position 4. 

This suggests we might have missed a word earlier. Let me re-examine the remaining letters for any valid combinations:

- F U B T A – not valid
- G U B T A – not valid
- H U B T A – not valid
- K U B T A – not valid
- M U B T A – not valid
- V U B T A – not valid
- W U B T A – not valid
- Z U B T A – not valid

Similarly for other letters, none seem to form valid words. This implies the only remaining possibility is ""BUTTA"", despite the repeated T. Since the game allows repeated letters unless proven otherwise, and we have no feedback against it, this must be the intended word.

Thus, the word is BUTTA.
