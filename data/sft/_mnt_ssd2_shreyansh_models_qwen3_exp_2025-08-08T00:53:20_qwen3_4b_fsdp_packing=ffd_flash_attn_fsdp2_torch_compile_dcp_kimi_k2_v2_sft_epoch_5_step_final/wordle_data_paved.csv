### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""SLATE"" instead as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters that should give good information about the secret word's composition.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - S, L, T are not in the word.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. REACT → R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R, C, T are not in the word (T already excluded from round 1).
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, C.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, E.
- Positions ruled out for A: 3.
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses none of S, L, T, R, C.

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc.
Vowels left: A, E, I, O, U (but we already have A and E).

A promising pattern: _ A _ E _ or _ E _ A _ or A _ _ E _ etc., avoiding forbidden positions.

Let’s try ""HEXAN"" – but X is uncommon and N is repeated.  
Better: ""PEAGE"" – but G is okay, and we have A and E, but E is in position 5 which is forbidden.  
Try ""MEAND"": M E A N D – A in position 3 is forbidden.

Try ""PANEL"": P A N E L – L is excluded.  
Try ""EAGAN"": E A G A N – A in position 4 is okay, E in position 1 is okay. This uses A and E correctly and avoids all excluded letters.

""EAGAN"" is valid (though less common), but let’s pick a more common word: ""PEAGE"" is invalid (E in 5).  
Another option: ""BEACH"" – but C is excluded.  
""BEADS"" – S excluded.  
""BEAKY"" – Y is okay, but K is okay.  
""BEAKY"" has A in position 3 which is forbidden.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""SLATE"" instead as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters that should give good information about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids S, L, T entirely.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REACT"":
- R, C are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (was in 3).
- E is in position 3 (was in 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - S, L, T are not in the word.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. REACT → R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R, C, T are not in the word (T already excluded from round 1).
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, C.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, E.
- Positions ruled out for A: 3.
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses none of S, L, T, R, C.

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc.
Vowels left: A, E, I, O, U (but we already have A and E).

A promising pattern: _ A _ E _ or _ E _ A _ or A _ _ E _ etc., avoiding forbidden positions.

Let’s try ""HEXAN"" – but X is uncommon and N is repeated.  
Better: ""PEAGE"" – but G is okay, and we have A and E, but E is in position 5 which is forbidden.  
Try ""MEAND"": M E A N D – A in position 3 is forbidden.  
Try ""BANAL"": B A N A L – L is excluded.  
Try ""PANEL"": P A N E L – L is excluded.  
Try ""EAGAN"": E A G A N – A in position 4 is okay, E in position 1 is okay. This uses A and E correctly and avoids all excluded letters.

""EAGAN"" is valid (though less common), but let’s pick a more common word: ""PEAGE"" is invalid (E in 5).  
Another option: ""BEACH"" – but C is excluded.  
""BEADS"" – S excluded.  
""BEAKY"" – Y is okay, but K is okay.  
""BEAKY"" has A in position 3 which is forbidden.  
""PEAKY"" – A in position 3 forbidden.  
""MEANT"" – T excluded.  
""MEAN"" is 4 letters.  
""HEMAN"" – H, E, M, A, N – E in position 2 is forbidden.  
""HEANA"" – not a word.  
""DEANS"" – S excluded.  
""DEANO"" – not a word.  
""PEANO"" – not a word.  
""PHASE"" – S excluded.  
""PHAGE"" – G okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEA"" – 4 letters.  
""PHLEAM"" – 5 letters, but M okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEAS"" – S excluded.  
""PHLEAT"" – T excluded.  
""PHLEAM"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:
A cannot be in position 3.
E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (positions 1, 2, 4, 5)
- _ A _ _ _ (positions 2, 4, 5)
- _ _ A _ _ (positions 3, 4, 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (positions 4, 5)
- _ _ _ _ A (position 5)

E cannot be in positions 2 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try ""E A _ _ _"":
E in 1, A in 2: E A _ _ _
Need 3 consonants, avoiding S, L, T, R, C.
Possible: E A G O N – but O is vowel, N okay. ""EAGON"" – not a word.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E S – S excluded.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E D – D okay, ""EAGED"" – not a word.
E A G E N – ""EAGEN"" – not a word.

Try ""E _ A _ _"":
E in 1, A in 3: E _ A _ _
Need letters in positions 2 and 4, avoiding excluded letters.
Possible: E D A N K – ""EDANK"" – not a word.
E M A N D – ""EMAND"" – not a word.
E M A G E – ""EMAGE"" – not a word.
E M A J E – ""EMAJE"" – not a word.

Try ""_ E A _ _"":
E in 2 is forbidden. Skip.

Try ""_ _ E A _"":
E in 3, A in 4: _ _ E A _
Possible: D E E A N – ""DEEAN"" – not a word.
M E E A N – ""MEEAN"" – not a word.
P E E A N – ""PEEAN"" – not a word.

Try ""_ _ _ E A"":
E in 4, A in 5: _ _ _ E A
Possible: B E N E A – ""BENEA"" – not a word.
M E N E A – ""MENEA"" – not a word.
P E N E A – ""PENEA"" – not a word.

Try ""A _ E _ _"":
A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _
Possible: A D E N K – ""ADENK"" – not a word.
A M E N D – ""AMEND"" – valid word, uses A and E correctly, avoids excluded letters.

""AMEND"" is a valid 5-letter word:
- A in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters: A, M, E, N, D – none of S, L, T, R, C.
This seems optimal.

Let’s verify:
- Does it contain A and E? Yes.
- Does it avoid excluded letters? Yes (no S, L, T, R, C).
- Are positions of A and E allowed? A in 1, E in 3 – both are allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""AMEND"".

Let's explore possible patterns:

Case 4: A in position 4, E in position 1
  - E _ _ A D

From the above, the only valid word found is ""PAGED"".

Let's verify:

- Contains A and E - ✓
- A is in position 4 (allowed for A)
- E is in position 2 (but E cannot be in position 2 from round 2 feedback)
Wait - this is a mistake!

From round 2 feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 2

But in ""PAGED"", E is in position 2 which is forbidden.

This invalidates ""PAGED"".

Re-examining Case 3 with correct constraints:
- A in position 2, E in position 4: _ A _ E D
- Need positions 1 and 3
- Possible: B A K E D - ""BAKED"" - valid word
  - Check letters: B, A, K, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed)
  - D is in position 5 (correct)
  - No forbidden letters

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BAKED"".

  - E D W A D - invalid
  - E D Y A D - invalid

Case 3: A in position 2, E in position 4
  - _ A _ E D
  - Need letters for positions 1 and 3
  - Possible: B A G E D - ""BAGED"" - invalid
  - F A G E D - ""FAGED"" - invalid
  - H A G E D - ""HAGED"" - invalid
  - K A G E D - ""KAGED"" - invalid
  - V A G E D - ""VALED"" - valid word

  - W A G E D - ""WAGED"" - invalid
  - Y A G E D - invalid
  - P A G E D - ""PAGED"" - valid word
    - Check letters: P, A, G, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
    - ""PAGED"" is a valid 5-letter word

Case 4: A in position 4, E in position 1
  - E _ _ A D
  - Already checked, no valid words found

From the above, the only valid word found is ""PAGED"".

Let's verify:
- Ends with D (position 5) - ✓
- Contains A and E - ✓
- A is in position 4 (allowed for A)
- E is in position 2 (but E cannot be in position 2 from round 2 feedback)
Wait - this is a mistake!

From round 2 feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 2

But in ""PAGED"", E is in position 2 which is forbidden.

This invalidates ""PAGED"".

Re-examining Case 3 with correct constraints:
- A in position 2, E in position 4: _ A _ E D
- Need positions 1 and 3
- Possible: B A K E D - ""BAKED"" - valid word
  - Check letters: B, A, K, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed)
  - D is in position 5 (correct)
  - No forbidden letters

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""BAKED"".",Guess 4: BAKED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""SLATE"" instead as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters that should give good information about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids S, L, T entirely.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REACT"":
- R, C are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (was in 3).
- E is in position 3 (was in 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - S, L, T are not in the word.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. REACT → R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R, C, T are not in the word (T already excluded from round 1).
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, C.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, E.
- Positions ruled out for A: 3.
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses none of S, L, T, R, C.

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc.
Vowels left: A, E, I, O, U (but we already have A and E).

A promising pattern: _ A _ E _ or _ E _ A _ or A _ _ E _ etc., avoiding forbidden positions.

Let’s try ""HEXAN"" – but X is uncommon and N is repeated.  
Better: ""PEAGE"" – but G is okay, and we have A and E, but E is in position 5 which is forbidden.  
Try ""MEAND"": M E A N D – A in position 3 is forbidden.  
Try ""BANAL"": B A N A L – L is excluded.  
Try ""PANEL"": P A N E L – L is excluded.  
Try ""EAGAN"": E A G A N – A in position 4 is okay, E in position 1 is okay. This uses A and E correctly and avoids all excluded letters.

""EAGAN"" is valid (though less common), but let’s pick a more common word: ""PEAGE"" is invalid (E in 5).  
Another option: ""BEACH"" – but C is excluded.  
""BEADS"" – S excluded.  
""BEAKY"" – Y is okay, but K is okay.  
""BEAKY"" has A in position 3 which is forbidden.  
""PEAKY"" – A in position 3 forbidden.  
""MEANT"" – T excluded.  
""MEAN"" is 4 letters.  
""HEMAN"" – H, E, M, A, N – E in position 2 is forbidden.  
""HEANA"" – not a word.  
""DEANS"" – S excluded.  
""DEANO"" – not a word.  
""PEANO"" – not a word.  
""PHASE"" – S excluded.  
""PHAGE"" – G okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEA"" – 4 letters.  
""PHLEAM"" – 5 letters, but M okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEAS"" – S excluded.  
""PHLEAT"" – T excluded.  
""PHLEAM"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:
A cannot be in position 3.
E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (positions 1, 2, 4, 5)
- _ A _ _ _ (positions 2, 4, 5)
- _ _ A _ _ (positions 3, 4, 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (positions 4, 5)
- _ _ _ _ A (position 5)

E cannot be in positions 2 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try ""E A _ _ _"":
E in 1, A in 2: E A _ _ _
Need 3 consonants, avoiding S, L, T, R, C.
Possible: E A G O N – but O is vowel, N okay. ""EAGON"" – not a word.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E S – S excluded.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E D – D okay, ""EAGED"" – not a word.
E A G E N – ""EAGEN"" – not a word.

Try ""E _ A _ _"":
E in 1, A in 3: E _ A _ _
Need letters in positions 2 and 4, avoiding excluded letters.
Possible: E D A N K – ""EDANK"" – not a word.
E M A N D – ""EMAND"" – not a word.
E M A G E – ""EMAGE"" – not a word.
E M A J E – ""EMAJE"" – not a word.

Try ""_ E A _ _"":
E in 2 is forbidden. Skip.

Try ""_ _ E A _"":
E in 3, A in 4: _ _ E A _
Possible: D E E A N – ""DEEAN"" – not a word.
M E E A N – ""MEEAN"" – not a word.
P E E A N – ""PEEAN"" – not a word.

Try ""_ _ _ E A"":
E in 4, A in 5: _ _ _ E A
Possible: B E N E A – ""BENEA"" – not a word.
M E N E A – ""MENEA"" – not a word.
P E N E A – ""PENEA"" – not a word.

Try ""A _ E _ _"":
A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _
Possible: A D E N K – ""ADENK"" – not a word.
A M E N D – ""AMEND"" – valid word, uses A and E correctly, avoids excluded letters.

""AMEND"" is a valid 5-letter word:
- A in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters: A, M, E, N, D – none of S, L, T, R, C.
This seems optimal.

Let’s verify:
- Does it contain A and E? Yes.
- Does it avoid excluded letters? Yes (no S, L, T, R, C).
- Are positions of A and E allowed? A in 1, E in 3 – both are allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""AMEND"".

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T
   - Letters IN the word but wrong position: A (not 3), E (not 5)

2. REACT → R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)

   - A is in the word but not in position 1
   - E is in the word but not in position 3
   - D is in the word and in the correct position (position 5)

Current knowledge:
- Word ends with D (position 5).
- Contains A and E, but:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 3 or 5
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, L, T, R, C, M, N

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in positions 2, 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded for A)
- E can be in positions 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are excluded for E)

We need a 5-letter word ending in D, containing A and E in allowed positions, using only remaining letters (no S,L,T,R,C,M,N).

Remaining letters to consider: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's explore possible patterns:
- Since D is fixed at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ D
- A must be in position 2 or 4
- E must be in position 1 or 4

Case 1: A in position 2, E in position 1
  - E A _ _ D
  - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding excluded letters
  - Possible: E A G E D (but E would be in position 4, which is allowed for E)
    - Check letters: E, A, G, E, D - all allowed
    - ""EAGED"" - not a valid English word

  - Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3
  - Possible: E D I A D - ""EDIA"" - invalid
  - E D G A D - ""EDGAD"" - invalid
  - E D B A D - ""EDBAD"" - invalid

  - P A G E D - ""PAGED"" - valid word
    - Check letters: P, A, G, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
    - ""PAGED"" is a valid 5-letter word

Case 4: A in position 4, E in position 1
  - E _ _ A D
  - Already checked, no valid words found

From the above, the only valid word found is ""PAGED"".

Let's verify:
- Ends with D (position 5) - ✓
- Contains A and E - ✓
- A is in position 4 (allowed for A)
- E is in position 2 (but E cannot be in position 2 from round 2 feedback)
Wait - this is a mistake!

From round 2 feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 2

But in ""PAGED"", E is in position 2 which is forbidden.

This invalidates ""PAGED"".

Re-examining Case 3 with correct constraints:

  - Check letters: B, A, K, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and covers vowels and consonants. However, I'll choose ""SLATE"" instead as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all high-frequency letters that should give good information about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids S, L, T entirely.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""REACT"":
- R, C are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (was in 3).
- E is in position 3 (was in 5).
- Avoids S, L, T.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - S, L, T are not in the word.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

2. REACT → R(x) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
   - R, C, T are not in the word (T already excluded from round 1).
   - E is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, R, C.
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, E.
- Positions ruled out for A: 3.
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
- Uses none of S, L, T, R, C.

Good remaining consonants: N, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, etc.
Vowels left: A, E, I, O, U (but we already have A and E).

A promising pattern: _ A _ E _ or _ E _ A _ or A _ _ E _ etc., avoiding forbidden positions.

Let’s try ""HEXAN"" – but X is uncommon and N is repeated.  
Better: ""PEAGE"" – but G is okay, and we have A and E, but E is in position 5 which is forbidden.  
Try ""MEAND"": M E A N D – A in position 3 is forbidden.  
Try ""BANAL"": B A N A L – L is excluded.  
Try ""PANEL"": P A N E L – L is excluded.  
Try ""EAGAN"": E A G A N – A in position 4 is okay, E in position 1 is okay. This uses A and E correctly and avoids all excluded letters.

""EAGAN"" is valid (though less common), but let’s pick a more common word: ""PEAGE"" is invalid (E in 5).  
Another option: ""BEACH"" – but C is excluded.  
""BEADS"" – S excluded.  
""BEAKY"" – Y is okay, but K is okay.  
""BEAKY"" has A in position 3 which is forbidden.  
""PEAKY"" – A in position 3 forbidden.  
""MEANT"" – T excluded.  
""MEAN"" is 4 letters.  
""HEMAN"" – H, E, M, A, N – E in position 2 is forbidden.  
""HEANA"" – not a word.  
""DEANS"" – S excluded.  
""DEANO"" – not a word.  
""PEANO"" – not a word.  
""PHASE"" – S excluded.  
""PHAGE"" – G okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEA"" – 4 letters.  
""PHLEAM"" – 5 letters, but M okay, A in 3 forbidden.  
""PHLEAS"" – S excluded.  
""PHLEAT"" – T excluded.  
""PHLEAM"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  
""PHLEA"" invalid.  

Let’s list possible positions for A and E:
A cannot be in position 3.
E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (positions 1, 2, 4, 5)
- _ A _ _ _ (positions 2, 4, 5)
- _ _ A _ _ (positions 3, 4, 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (positions 4, 5)
- _ _ _ _ A (position 5)

E cannot be in positions 2 or 5, so possible positions: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s try ""E A _ _ _"":
E in 1, A in 2: E A _ _ _
Need 3 consonants, avoiding S, L, T, R, C.
Possible: E A G O N – but O is vowel, N okay. ""EAGON"" – not a word.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E S – S excluded.
E A G E R – R excluded.
E A G E D – D okay, ""EAGED"" – not a word.
E A G E N – ""EAGEN"" – not a word.

Try ""E _ A _ _"":
E in 1, A in 3: E _ A _ _
Need letters in positions 2 and 4, avoiding excluded letters.
Possible: E D A N K – ""EDANK"" – not a word.
E M A N D – ""EMAND"" – not a word.
E M A G E – ""EMAGE"" – not a word.
E M A J E – ""EMAJE"" – not a word.

Try ""_ E A _ _"":
E in 2 is forbidden. Skip.

Try ""_ _ E A _"":
E in 3, A in 4: _ _ E A _
Possible: D E E A N – ""DEEAN"" – not a word.
M E E A N – ""MEEAN"" – not a word.
P E E A N – ""PEEAN"" – not a word.

Try ""_ _ _ E A"":
E in 4, A in 5: _ _ _ E A
Possible: B E N E A – ""BENEA"" – not a word.
M E N E A – ""MENEA"" – not a word.
P E N E A – ""PENEA"" – not a word.

Try ""A _ E _ _"":
A in 1, E in 3: A _ E _ _
Possible: A D E N K – ""ADENK"" – not a word.
A M E N D – ""AMEND"" – valid word, uses A and E correctly, avoids excluded letters.

""AMEND"" is a valid 5-letter word:
- A in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 3 (allowed).
- Letters: A, M, E, N, D – none of S, L, T, R, C.
This seems optimal.

Let’s verify:
- Does it contain A and E? Yes.
- Does it avoid excluded letters? Yes (no S, L, T, R, C).
- Are positions of A and E allowed? A in 1, E in 3 – both are allowed.

Therefore, the next guess should be ""AMEND"".

Current knowledge:
- Word ends with D (position 5).
- Contains A and E, but:
  - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  - E cannot be in positions 2 or 3 or 5
- Letters definitely not in the word: S, L, T, R, C, M, N

Possible positions for A and E:
- A can be in positions 2, 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded for A)
- E can be in positions 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are excluded for E)

We need a 5-letter word ending in D, containing A and E in allowed positions, using only remaining letters (no S,L,T,R,C,M,N).

Remaining letters to consider: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's explore possible patterns:
- Since D is fixed at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ D
- A must be in position 2 or 4
- E must be in position 1 or 4

Case 1: A in position 2, E in position 1
  - E A _ _ D
  - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding excluded letters
  - Possible: E A G E D (but E would be in position 4, which is allowed for E)
    - Check letters: E, A, G, E, D - all allowed

  - W A G E D - ""WAGED"" - invalid
  - Y A G E D - invalid
  - P A G E D - ""PAGED"" - valid word
    - Check letters: P, A, G, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
    - ""PAGED"" is a valid 5-letter word

Case 4: A in position 4, E in position 1
  - E _ _ A D
  - Already checked, no valid words found

From the above, the only valid word found is ""PAGED"".

Let's verify:
- Ends with D (position 5) - ✓
- Contains A and E - ✓
- A is in position 4 (allowed for A)
- E is in position 2 (but E cannot be in position 2 from round 2 feedback)
Wait - this is a mistake!

From round 2 feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 2

But in ""PAGED"", E is in position 2 which is forbidden.

This invalidates ""PAGED"".

Re-examining Case 3 with correct constraints:
- A in position 2, E in position 4: _ A _ E D
- Need positions 1 and 3
- Possible: B A K E D - ""BAKED"" - valid word
  - Check letters: B, A, K, E, D - all allowed (no excluded letters)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed)
  - D is in position 5 (correct)
  - No forbidden letters

This fits all constraints.

- Remaining positions 1 and 3 need letters not yet excluded

Remaining letters to consider for positions 1 and 3: F, G, H, I, J, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ A _ E D with letters from remaining pool.

Possible candidates:
- F A G E D - ""FAGED"" - invalid
- H A G E D - ""HAGED"" - invalid
- P A G E D - ""PAGED"" - invalid (E in position 2, but E must be in 4)
- V A G E D - ""VALED"" - invalid (L excluded)
- W A G E D - ""WAGED"" - invalid
- G A F E D - ""GAFED"" - invalid
- G A H E D - ""GAHED"" - invalid
- G A V E D - ""GAVED"" - valid word
  - Check letters: G, A, V, E, D - all allowed
  - Pattern: G A V E D - positions 1,2,3,4,5
  - A in 2, E in 4, D in 5 - matches confirmed positions
  - No excluded letters used

""GAVED"" is a valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.
