For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A strong starting word would use a mix of these letters.

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It includes common consonants R and S
3. The letter 'E' is the most common in English words
4. It covers 5 distinct letters with no duplicates

Therefore, I'll choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.

- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters (especially vowels) that weren't eliminated.
3. Avoids R, A, I.

Good candidates:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – uses S and E, adds T, O, L.
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – uses S and E, adds P, O, K.
- SHOVE (S, H, O, V, E) – uses S and E, adds H, O, V.

""STOLE"" seems best because:
- S moves from 4th to 1st position.
- E moves from 5th to 5th position (but we know E isn't 5th, so this is bad).
Oops, E is still 5th – can't use this.

""SHOVE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (still invalid).

""SPOKE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (invalid).

""STOLE"" E is 5th (invalid).

""SENTO"" (E is 2nd, S is 1st – valid).

From the new feedback on SLEET:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, E (fixed at position 4), T.
- S is NOT in position 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SLEET feedback).
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T is NOT in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, L.

We still need to place S and T in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their constraints.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by E), so T can be in 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to introduce new common letters (since we’ve only used S, E, T so far). Good remaining common letters are O, U, N, C, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 4.
2. Places S and T in allowable positions.
3. Adds new common letters.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ E _

Possible placements:
- If S is in 2: _ S _ E _
- If S is in 3: _ _ S E _
- If S is in 5: _ _ _ E S

And T must fit into 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try S in 2 and T in 1: T S _ E _
Need two more letters, avoiding R, A, I, L. Good options: O, U, N, C, D.

“TSOEW” isn’t a word. “TSUN E” isn’t valid.

Try S in 3 and T in 1: T _ S E _
“TENSE” – but N and S are already considered, and E is repeated. Not ideal.

Try S in 5 and T in 1: T _ _ E S
“TOWER” – but R is out. “TOGES” – not a word. “TUNES” – N and U are new, S is at 5 (allowed), T at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (fixed).

“TUNES” fits all constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U new
- N new
- E in 4 (fixed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

No forbidden letters (R, A, I, L) are used.

So we now know:

- S is NOT in position 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SLEET feedback).
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T is NOT in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, L.

We still need to place S and T in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their constraints.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by E), so T can be in 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to introduce new common letters (since we’ve only used S, E, T so far). Good remaining common letters are O, U, N, C, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 4.
2. Places S and T in allowable positions.
3. Adds new common letters.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A strong starting word would use a mix of these letters.

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It includes common consonants R and S
3. The letter 'E' is the most common in English words
4. It covers 5 distinct letters with no duplicates

Therefore, I'll choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters (especially vowels) that weren't eliminated.
3. Avoids R, A, I.

Good candidates:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – uses S and E, adds T, O, L.
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – uses S and E, adds P, O, K.
- SHOVE (S, H, O, V, E) – uses S and E, adds H, O, V.

""STOLE"" seems best because:
- S moves from 4th to 1st position.
- E moves from 5th to 5th position (but we know E isn't 5th, so this is bad).
Oops, E is still 5th – can't use this.

""SHOVE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (still invalid).

""SPOKE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (invalid).

""STOLE"" E is 5th (invalid).

Need E not in 5th. Let's try:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).
- SHONE (S, H, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).

""STELE"" (but has E in 5th and 4th – not ideal).

""SENTO"" (E is 2nd, S is 1st – valid).

""SENTO"" uses S, E, N, T, O – all new letters except S and E which we know are present.

Another good option is ""SLEET"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 2nd and 4th (but 4th E is same as 5th in RAISE feedback, and we know E isn't 5th – but here E is 4th and 2nd, which is fine).
- L is new.
- T is new.
- E is 4th (new position).

""SLEET"" seems better because:
- S is 1st (new).
- E is 2nd and 4th (both new positions).
- L and T are new common letters.

Thus, I'll choose SLEET.

From the new feedback on SLEET:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

- The word contains S, E (fixed at position 4), T.
- S is NOT in position 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SLEET feedback).
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T is NOT in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, L.

We still need to place S and T in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their constraints.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by E), so T can be in 1, 2, or 3.

“TOWER” – but R is out. “TOGES” – not a word. “TUNES” – N and U are new, S is at 5 (allowed), T at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (fixed).

“TUNES” fits all constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U new

Looking again, the only common word that fits T _ _ E S without duplicates is ""TWEES"" (T-W-E-E-S), but this has two E's, which might be acceptable since the feedback didn't prohibit duplicate letters.

But a more straightforward fit is ""TWEES"" (though rare), or ""TWEET"" (but E is in wrong position).

Re-evaluating, the intended word is likely ""TWEES"" or ""TWEET"", but since ""TWEET"" is more common, let's check:

- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters (especially vowels) that weren't eliminated.
3. Avoids R, A, I.

Good candidates:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – uses S and E, adds T, O, L.
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – uses S and E, adds P, O, K.
- SHOVE (S, H, O, V, E) – uses S and E, adds H, O, V.

""STOLE"" seems best because:
- S moves from 4th to 1st position.
- E moves from 5th to 5th position (but we know E isn't 5th, so this is bad).
Oops, E is still 5th – can't use this.

""SHOVE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (still invalid).

""SPOKE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (invalid).

""STOLE"" E is 5th (invalid).

Need E not in 5th. Let's try:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).
- SHONE (S, H, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).

""STELE"" (but has E in 5th and 4th – not ideal).

""SENTO"" (E is 2nd, S is 1st – valid).

""SENTO"" uses S, E, N, T, O – all new letters except S and E which we know are present.

Another good option is ""SLEET"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 2nd and 4th (but 4th E is same as 5th in RAISE feedback, and we know E isn't 5th – but here E is 4th and 2nd, which is fine).
- L is new.
- T is new.
- E is 4th (new position).

""SLEET"" seems better because:
- S is 1st (new).
- E is 2nd and 4th (both new positions).
- L and T are new common letters.

Thus, I'll choose SLEET.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(✓) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SLEET:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, E (fixed at position 4), T.
- S is NOT in position 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SLEET feedback).
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T is NOT in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, L.

We still need to place S and T in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their constraints.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by E), so T can be in 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to introduce new common letters (since we’ve only used S, E, T so far). Good remaining common letters are O, U, N, C, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 4.
2. Places S and T in allowable positions.
3. Adds new common letters.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ E _

Possible placements:
- If S is in 2: _ S _ E _
- If S is in 3: _ _ S E _
- If S is in 5: _ _ _ E S

And T must fit into 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try S in 2 and T in 1: T S _ E _
Need two more letters, avoiding R, A, I, L. Good options: O, U, N, C, D.

“TSOEW” isn’t a word. “TSUN E” isn’t valid.

Try S in 3 and T in 1: T _ S E _
“TENSE” – but N and S are already considered, and E is repeated. Not ideal.

Try S in 5 and T in 1: T _ _ E S
“TOWER” – but R is out. “TOGES” – not a word. “TUNES” – N and U are new, S is at 5 (allowed), T at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (fixed).

“TUNES” fits all constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U new
- N new
- E in 4 (fixed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

No forbidden letters (R, A, I, L) are used.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(✓) T(-)
Guess 3: TUNES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 3 (TUNES):
- T(✓) – T is in position 1 and correct.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 and correct.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

So the word structure is now fully determined:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters already confirmed: T, E, S.
Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, L, U, N.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding the ruled-out letters). Common remaining consonants and vowels include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern T _ _ E S:
- TIGER – contains R (ruled out)
- TOWER – contains R (ruled out)
- TYRES – contains R (ruled out)
- TWEES – contains W (possible)
- TWEES – valid word (though rare)
- TWEET – contains T (already in position 1, but T can repeat)
- TWEET – valid word

""TWEET"" fits perfectly:
- T(1) ✓
- W(2) – new letter
- E(3) – but E is already in position 4, so this would duplicate E, which is allowed since the feedback only ruled out specific positions, not duplicates.
- E(4) ✓
- T(5) ✓

However, ""TWEET"" has E in position 3, but we know E must be in position 4. So ""TWEET"" is invalid because it places E in position 3.

Looking again, the only common word that fits T _ _ E S without duplicates is ""TWEES"" (T-W-E-E-S), but this has two E's, which might be acceptable since the feedback didn't prohibit duplicate letters.

But a more straightforward fit is ""TWEES"" (though rare), or ""TWEET"" (but E is in wrong position).

Re-evaluating, the intended word is likely ""TWEES"" or ""TWEET"", but since ""TWEET"" is more common, let's check:
- TWEET: T-W-E-E-T
  - Position 3 has E (invalid, must be position 4)
  
Next possible: ""TWICE"" – but C is new, I is ruled out (I(x)).

""TWICE"" is invalid due to I.

""THOSE"":
- T(1) ✓
- H(2) – new
- O(3) – new
- S(4) – but E must be in 4, so invalid.

""TOPES"":
- T(1) ✓
- O(2) – new
- P(3) – new
- E(4) ✓
- S(5) ✓

""TOPES"" fits perfectly:
- T(1) ✓
- O(2) – new letter
- P(3) – new letter
- E(4) ✓
- S(5) ✓

No ruled-out letters are used, and it's a valid English word.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. 

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A strong starting word would use a mix of these letters.

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowel positions
2. It includes common consonants R and S
3. The letter 'E' is the most common in English words
4. It covers 5 distinct letters with no duplicates

Therefore, I'll choose ""RAISE"" as the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses S and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters (especially vowels) that weren't eliminated.
3. Avoids R, A, I.

Good candidates:
- STOLE (S, T, O, L, E) – uses S and E, adds T, O, L.
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – uses S and E, adds P, O, K.
- SHOVE (S, H, O, V, E) – uses S and E, adds H, O, V.

""STOLE"" seems best because:
- S moves from 4th to 1st position.
- E moves from 5th to 5th position (but we know E isn't 5th, so this is bad).
Oops, E is still 5th – can't use this.

""SHOVE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (still invalid).

""SPOKE"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 5th (invalid).

""STOLE"" E is 5th (invalid).

Need E not in 5th. Let's try:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).
- SHONE (S, H, O, N, E) – E is 5th (invalid).

""STELE"" (but has E in 5th and 4th – not ideal).

""SENTO"" (E is 2nd, S is 1st – valid).

""SENTO"" uses S, E, N, T, O – all new letters except S and E which we know are present.

Another good option is ""SLEET"":
- S is 1st (new position).
- E is 2nd and 4th (but 4th E is same as 5th in RAISE feedback, and we know E isn't 5th – but here E is 4th and 2nd, which is fine).
- L is new.
- T is new.
- E is 4th (new position).

""SLEET"" seems better because:
- S is 1st (new).
- E is 2nd and 4th (both new positions).
- L and T are new common letters.

Thus, I'll choose SLEET.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(✓) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SLEET:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word AND in position 4.
- T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, E (fixed at position 4), T.
- S is NOT in position 1 or 4 (from RAISE and SLEET feedback).
- E is fixed at position 4.
- T is NOT in position 5.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, L.

We still need to place S and T in the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 5) while respecting their constraints.

Possible positions:
- S can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is taken by E), so T can be in 1, 2, or 3.

We also need to introduce new common letters (since we’ve only used S, E, T so far). Good remaining common letters are O, U, N, C, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps E in position 4.
2. Places S and T in allowable positions.
3. Adds new common letters.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ E _

Possible placements:
- If S is in 2: _ S _ E _
- If S is in 3: _ _ S E _
- If S is in 5: _ _ _ E S

And T must fit into 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try S in 2 and T in 1: T S _ E _
Need two more letters, avoiding R, A, I, L. Good options: O, U, N, C, D.

“TSOEW” isn’t a word. “TSUN E” isn’t valid.

Try S in 3 and T in 1: T _ S E _
“TENSE” – but N and S are already considered, and E is repeated. Not ideal.

Try S in 5 and T in 1: T _ _ E S
“TOWER” – but R is out. “TOGES” – not a word. “TUNES” – N and U are new, S is at 5 (allowed), T at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (fixed).

“TUNES” fits all constraints:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- U new
- N new
- E in 4 (fixed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

No forbidden letters (R, A, I, L) are used.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SLEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) E(-) E(✓) T(-)
Guess 3: TUNES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From Guess 3 (TUNES):
- T(✓) – T is in position 1 and correct.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 and correct.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

So the word structure is now fully determined:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters already confirmed: T, E, S.
Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, L, U, N.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding the ruled-out letters). Common remaining consonants and vowels include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern T _ _ E S:
- TIGER – contains R (ruled out)
- TOWER – contains R (ruled out)
- TYRES – contains R (ruled out)
- TWEES – contains W (possible)
- TWEES – valid word (though rare)
- TWEET – contains T (already in position 1, but T can repeat)
- TWEET – valid word

""TWEET"" fits perfectly:
- T(1) ✓
- W(2) – new letter
- E(3) – but E is already in position 4, so this would duplicate E, which is allowed since the feedback only ruled out specific positions, not duplicates.
- E(4) ✓
- T(5) ✓

However, ""TWEET"" has E in position 3, but we know E must be in position 4. So ""TWEET"" is invalid because it places E in position 3.

Looking again, the only common word that fits T _ _ E S without duplicates is ""TWEES"" (T-W-E-E-S), but this has two E's, which might be acceptable since the feedback didn't prohibit duplicate letters.

But a more straightforward fit is ""TWEES"" (though rare), or ""TWEET"" (but E is in wrong position).

Re-evaluating, the intended word is likely ""TWEES"" or ""TWEET"", but since ""TWEET"" is more common, let's check:
- TWEET: T-W-E-E-T
  - Position 3 has E (invalid, must be position 4)
  
Next possible: ""TWICE"" – but C is new, I is ruled out (I(x)).

""TWICE"" is invalid due to I.

""THOSE"":
- T(1) ✓
- H(2) – new
- O(3) – new
- S(4) – but E must be in 4, so invalid.

""TOPES"":
- T(1) ✓
- O(2) – new
- P(3) – new
- E(4) ✓
- S(5) ✓

""TOPES"" fits perfectly:
- T(1) ✓
- O(2) – new letter
- P(3) – new letter
- E(4) ✓
- S(5) ✓

No ruled-out letters are used, and it's a valid English word.

From Guess 4 (TOPES):
- T(✓) – T is correct in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is correct in position 2.
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

We only need one letter for position 3. Letters already ruled out include R, A, I, L, U, N, P.

Remaining common consonants for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit T O _ E S:
- TOBES – not common
- TOGES – not common
- TOWES – valid word (archaic but listed)
- TOLES – contains L (ruled out)
- TONES – contains N (ruled out)
- TOVES – not common
- TOZES – not common

The only valid word here is ""TOWES"" (though archaic), but ""TOWES"" is valid. However, ""TOWES"" is a valid variant of ""tow"" as a noun.

But let's check if ""TOWES"" is acceptable in Wordle-like games – it's on some dictionaries.

Alternatively, ""TOBES"" is a valid word (plural of tobe), but less common.

Between these, ""TOWES"" seems the most plausible.

But wait, let's double-check:
- T O _ E S
- Position 3 must be a consonant not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, Z.

Common letters: C, D, G, H, K, M.

Looking again:
- TOCES – not a word
- TODES – not a word
- TOGES – not common
- TOHES – not a word
- TOKES – valid word (slang for ""took"")
- TOMES – valid word (plural of tome)
- TOVES – not common

Between ""TOKES"" and ""TOMES"":
- ""TOKES"" is more colloquial
- ""TOMES"" is more standard

""TOMES"" is a valid word (plural of tome, a thick book).

Thus, the word must be ""TOMES"".
