2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present and their positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

Between these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because S is very common in English words and can often be in position 1 or 2. Let me go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Possible letters left (excluding L, T, E): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that places S in a different position and uses other common letters. ""CRASH"" comes to mind:
- C: possible
- R: possible
- A: in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in position 3) → invalid.

Next, ""RAISE"":
- R: possible
- A: in position 2 (allowed)
- I: possible
- S: in position 4 (allowed, since S was in position 1 before)
- E: but E is excluded → invalid.

Next, ""SOUND"":
- S: position 1 (but S was in position 1 before and marked wrong) → invalid.

Next, ""ADIOS"":
- A: position 1 (allowed, since A was in position 3 before)
- D: possible
- I: possible
- O: possible
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S was in position 1 before)

This seems valid. Let’s go with ""ADIOS"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADIOS -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. ADIOS → A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)
   - A is now confirmed in position 1.
   - O is in the word and in position 4.
   - S is in the word and in position 5.
   - D and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ O S
- Letters already confirmed: A, O, S
- Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, D, I
- Letters still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 2 and 3. Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit A _ _ O S.

Possible candidates:
- AFOUL (but U is allowed, F is allowed)
- AGONY (but N is allowed, Y is allowed)
- AMORS (but R is allowed, second S is already at 5)
- ANGOS (but N is allowed, G is allowed)

Let's try ""ANGOS"":
- A (position 1) ✓
- N (position 2) - new letter
- G (position 3) - new letter
- O (position 4) ✓
- S (position 5) ✓

This seems valid as all letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels are present and their positions.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nBetween these, ""SLATE"" might be slightly better because S is very common in English words and can often be in position 1 or 2.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - A is in the word, not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are out.

2. ADIOS → A(✓) D(x) I(x) O(✓) S(✓)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - O is fixed in position 4.
   - S is fixed in position 5.
   - D, I are out.

3. ANGOS → A(✓) N(x) G(-) O(✓) S(✓)
   - A, O, S still correct in positions 1-4-5.
   - N is not in the word.
   - G is in the word but not in position 3.

So the pattern is: A _ _ O S and the missing letters (positions 2 and 3) must include G somewhere, but G cannot be in position 3. Therefore G must be in position 2.

That leaves position 3 still unknown, but we know it cannot be N, and must be a letter not yet ruled out (not L, T, E, D, I, N).

Possible remaining letters for position 3: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word of the form A G _ O S.

The only common word that fits is ""AGROS"" (short for agriculture), but let's check if it's valid - yes, ""AGROS"" is a recognized 5-letter word meaning agricultural.

But let me double-check: is there another? ""AGMOS"" isn't a word, ""AGPOS"" isn't, etc. ""AGROS"" seems to be the only valid one.

However, ""AGROS"" uses R which hasn't been ruled out, and G in position 2 satisfies the feedback (G is in the word but not in position 3 - here it's in position 2).

Therefore, ""AGROS"" is the logical next guess.
