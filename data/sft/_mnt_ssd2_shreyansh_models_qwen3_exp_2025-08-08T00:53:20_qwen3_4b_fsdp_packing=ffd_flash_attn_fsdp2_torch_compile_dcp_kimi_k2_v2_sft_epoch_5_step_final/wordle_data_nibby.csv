### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the vowels will help us quickly identify which vowels are present in the secret word.

None of the letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminates A, R, O, S, E.

2. UNITY → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates U and T.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.  
   ⇒ Y is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word ends in Y and contains N and I somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively. Remaining letters to try should avoid A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Good remaining consonants: D, G, H, K, L, M, P, B, F, etc.  
Good remaining vowel: I (already known to be present), and possibly no others left (since A, E, O, U are out). So the word must contain I and N, and end in Y.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ Y  
Constraints:  
- Must include N and I.  
- N cannot be in position 2.  
- I cannot be in position 3.

Let’s try a word that places I and N in new positions and uses fresh consonants.  
Example: “DININ” – but this repeats letters and may not be valid.  
“MINCY” – uses M, I, N, C, Y.  
Check: M, I, N, C, Y – none are in the eliminated set.  
Positions:  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since previous I was in position 3).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since previous N was in position 2).  
- C is new.  
- Y is in position 5 (matches feedback).

So “MINCY” is a valid guess that meets all constraints.

From the feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

2. UNITY → U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)

   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 2.  
   ⇒ I is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ Y is in position 5.

3. MINCY → M(x) I(✓) N(-) C(x) Y(✓)  
   ⇒ Eliminates M, C.  
   ⇒ I is in position 2 (✓).  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 3.  
   ⇒ Y is in position 5 (✓).

Current constraints:
- Word ends in Y (position 5).  
- I is in position 2.  
- N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
- Valid letters so far: I, N, Y.  
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, M, C.  
- Remaining possible consonants: D, G, H, K, L, P, B, F, etc.

Structure: _ I _ _ Y  
N must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- N I _ _ Y  
- _ I _ N Y  

Let’s try N I _ _ Y first.  
Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4, avoiding eliminated letters.  
Good candidates: D, G, H, K, L, P, B, F.

Possible word: N I D G Y → ""NIDGY"" – but ""NIDGY"" is not a valid English word.  
""NIGGY"" – invalid (double G and not common).  
""NIBBY"" – uses B, but B is allowed.  
""NIBBY"" is valid (though colloquial).  

Alternatively, _ I _ N Y:  
Positions 1, 3 need consonants.  
Possible: D I N N Y – invalid (double N).  
F I N N Y – invalid.  
B I N N Y – invalid.  
D I N N Y – invalid.  

Let’s try N I B B Y – invalid.  

Another approach: N I _ _ Y with valid words.  
""NINNY"" – uses N twice, but N is allowed.  
""NINNY"" is a valid word meaning silly.  

Check constraints:  
- N in position 1 (allowed, since N was not in position 1 before).  
- I in position 2 (✓).  
- N in position 3 – but feedback says N is not in position 3.  
So ""NINNY"" is invalid because of N in position 3.  

Next option: N I D D Y – invalid.

Let’s try N I _ _ Y with valid words:  
""NINNY"" – invalid position for N.  
""NIGGY"" – invalid.  
""NIBBY"" – valid, uses B.  
Check N I B B Y:  
- N in position 1 (allowed).  
- I in position 2 (✓).  
- B in 3 and 4 (new letters).  
- Y in 5 (✓).  

""NIBBY"" seems the best available option.
