3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use these letters without repeating any. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct first position.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with R.
2. It contains both I and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R
- Contains I and S somewhere (but I ≠ 3, S ≠ 4)
- Does not contain A or E

Possible letters left (excluding A, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good next guess would introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try a word that places I and S in new positions and brings in other common consonants.

Candidate: RISKY
- Starts with R
- Contains I and S
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 3)
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 4)
- Introduces K and Y, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. R A I S E → R(✓) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
   - R is fixed in position 1.
   - A and E are not in the word.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. R I S K Y → R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(✓) Y(x)
   - R(✓) and I(✓) confirm positions 1 and 2.
   - S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - K(✓) means K is in the word and in position 4.
   - Y(x) means Y is not in the word.

So far we have:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: Not S, and must be one of the remaining letters (not A, E, Y).
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: Must be a letter not yet ruled out (not A, E, Y).

Letters confirmed in the word: R, I, S, K  
Letters ruled out: A, E, Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R I _ K _ and contains S somewhere, but S cannot be in position 3 (from feedback) and cannot be in position 4 (already K). So S must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is now known to NOT be S. Therefore S must be in position 5.

Thus the word has the form: R I _ K S

The blank in position 3 must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out and isn't already used (R, I, K, S). From the alphabet excluding A, E, Y, and the used letters, possible choices include common letters like N, T, L, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting R I _ K S:
- RINKS (valid word)
- RITKS (not a word)
- RILKS (not a word)
- RINCS (not a word)

""RINKS"" is a valid English word meaning small notches or grooves, and it fits all constraints:
- Starts with R I
- Has K in position 4
- Has S in position 5
- Doesn't contain A, E, or Y
- Contains S in position 5 (allowed, since S was only excluded from positions 3 and 4)

From all feedback so far:

1. R A I S E → R(✓) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
2. R I S K Y → R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(✓) Y(x)
3. R I N K S → R(✓) I(✓) N(x) K(✓) S(✓)

We now know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: R (✓)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: Not N (x), and from earlier not S (-). Also, from Guess 2, S was excluded from position 3. So position 3 must be filled by a letter that hasn't been ruled out yet.
- Position 4: K (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)

Letters confirmed in the word: R, I, K, S  
Letters ruled out: A, E, Y, N

We have the structure: R I _ K S

The blank in position 3 must be a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, E, Y, N)
- Is not already used in the word (R, I, K, S)
- Must form a valid 5-letter English word

Looking at common letters not yet excluded: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- R I B K S → ""RIBKS"" – not a word
- R I C K S → ""RICKS"" – valid (variant of RICK)
- R I D K S → ""RIDD"" – not 5 letters
- R I L K S → ""RILKS"" – valid (archaic for ""to link"")
- R I M K S → ""RIMKS"" – not a word
- R I O K S → ""RIOKS"" – not a word
- R I T K S → ""RITKS"" – not a word
- R I P K S → ""RIPKS"" – not a word
- R I L K S → ""RILKS"" – valid

Between ""RICKS"" and ""RILKS"", ""RICKS"" is more commonly recognized as a valid word (though rare), and ""RILKS"" is archaic. Both fit, but ""RICKS"" is slightly more likely in standard wordle dictionaries.

Thus, the next logical guess is ""RICKS"".
