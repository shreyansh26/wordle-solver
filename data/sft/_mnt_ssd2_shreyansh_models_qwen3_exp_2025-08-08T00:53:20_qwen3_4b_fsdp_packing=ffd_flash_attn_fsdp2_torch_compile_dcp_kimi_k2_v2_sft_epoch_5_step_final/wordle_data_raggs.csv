### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving us good coverage for elimination

- A in position 2 (was 1st, so new position)
- R in position 3 (was 2nd, so new position)
- I (new letter, common)
- N (new letter, common)

This covers the required letters and introduces new common letters (I, N) to test.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. SARIN → S(-) A(✓) R(-) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It must contain S and R somewhere.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: O, E, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- S and R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5 for S; positions 1, 4, or 5 for R).
- No O, E, I, N.

Candidate words:
- CARSY – but Y is uncommon and S is in position 4 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).
- DRABS – but B is new, S in 4 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden).
- TRASH – T, R, A, S, H. A is in 2 (good), S is in 4 (allowed), R is in 3 (forbidden).
- CRASH – C, R, A, S, H. R in 2 (forbidden).
- GRASP – G, R, A, S, P. R in 2 (forbidden).
- STARK – S in 1 (forbidden).
- CARTS – C, A, R, T, S. A in 2 (good), S in 5 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).
- DARTS – R in 3 (forbidden).
- MARSY – M, A, R, S, Y. A in 2 (good), S in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).

None of these fit. Let’s list positions:

Pattern: _ A _ _ _
S must be in 3, 4, or 5.
R must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).

Possible overlaps:
- If S is in 4, R can be in 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3, R can be in 1 or 5.
- If S is in 5, R can be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try:
- R A S _ _ → but S would be in 3 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed). Need two more letters, no O/E/I/N. R A S _ _ → RASPY? Y is okay, but P is new. RASPY – R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). No forbidden letters, fits all constraints.

RASPY:
- A in 2 (confirmed ✓).
- S in 3 (was 1st and 4th, now 3rd – allowed).
- R in 1 (was 2nd and 3rd, now 1st – allowed).
- P and Y are new letters, no conflict with forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving us good coverage for elimination

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is NOT in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S (each somewhere other than their original positions)
- Does NOT contain O or E
- Has 5 letters, none of which are O or E, and must include A, R, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, R, S
2. Excludes O, E
3. Places A, R, S in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd, S not 4th)

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""SARIN"":
- S in position 1 (was 4th, so new position)
- A in position 2 (was 1st, so new position)
- R in position 3 (was 2nd, so new position)

- S in 3 (was 1st and 4th, now 3rd – allowed).
- R in 1 (was 2nd and 3rd, now 1st – allowed).
- P and Y are new letters, no conflict with forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. SARIN → S(-) A(✓) R(-) I(x) N(x)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

3. RASPY → R(✓) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and Y are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- The word has the pattern R A _ _ _
- It must contain S somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since S cannot be in 1, 2, 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: O, E, I, N, P, Y.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""RA"" and ending with ""S"" or having ""S"" in position 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- R A _ S _
- R A _ _ S

Looking at common words:
- R A B S _ → no common word.
- R A C S _ → no common word.
- R A D S _ → no common word.
- R A F S _ → no common word.
- R A G S _ → no common word.
- R A H S _ → no common word.
- R A K S _ → no common word.
- R A L S _ → no common word.
- R A M S _ → no common word.
- R A T S _ → RATS_ – but ""RATS"" is only 4 letters.
- R A U S _ → no common word.
- R A V S _ → no common word.
- R A W S _ → no common word.
- R A Z S _ → no common word.

Looking at ""R A _ _ S"":
- R A B E S – but E is forbidden.
- R A C E S – E forbidden.
- R A D E S – E forbidden.
- R A F E S – E forbidden.
- R A G E S – E forbidden.
- R A H E S – E forbidden.
- R A K E S – E forbidden.
- R A L E S – E forbidden.
- R A M E S – E forbidden.
- R A T E S – E forbidden.
- R A V E S – E forbidden.
- R A W E S – E forbidden.
- R A Z E S – E forbidden.

None of these work. Let’s try ""R A _ S _"":
- R A B S _ – no common word.
- R A C S _ – no common word.
- R A D S _ – no common word.
- R A F S _ – no common word.
- R A G S _ – no common word.
- R A H S _ – no common word.
- R A K S _ – no common word.
- R A L S _ – no common word.
- R A M S _ – no common word.
- R A T S _ – no common word.
- R A V S _ – no common word.
- R A W S _ – no common word.
- R A Z S _ – no common word.

Hmm, seems like common words are scarce. Let me think of less common words or check if I missed any.

Looking at ""R A _ _ S"" again with remaining letters:
- R A B S _ – no.
- R A C S _ – no.
- R A D S _ – no.
- R A F S _ – no.
- R A G S _ – no.
- R A H S _ – no.
- R A K S _ – no.
- R A L S _ – no.
- R A M S _ – no.
- R A T S _ – no.
- R A V S _ – no.
- R A W S _ – no.
- R A Z S _ – no.

Wait, what about ""R A D I S""? But I is forbidden.

""R A M P S"" – P is forbidden.

""R A C K S"" – K is allowed, but is ""RACKS"" a word? Yes, it is.

Check ""RACKS"":
- R A C K S
- Pattern: R(1) A(2) C(3) K(4) S(5)
- Contains S in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,2,3 but can be 4 or 5).
- All letters are allowed (C, K not forbidden).
- This seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- R in 1: confirmed ✓
- A in 2: confirmed ✓
- S in 5: allowed (not in 1,2,3,4)
- C and K: new letters, no conflict.

Thus, ""RACKS"" is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It uses 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
2. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words, giving us good coverage for elimination

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is NOT in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, S (each somewhere other than their original positions)
- Does NOT contain O or E
- Has 5 letters, none of which are O or E, and must include A, R, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A, R, S
2. Excludes O, E
3. Places A, R, S in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd, S not 4th)

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good candidate is ""SARIN"":
- S in position 1 (was 4th, so new position)
- A in position 2 (was 1st, so new position)
- R in position 3 (was 2nd, so new position)
- I (new letter, common)
- N (new letter, common)

This covers the required letters and introduces new common letters (I, N) to test.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - O and E are not in the word.

2. SARIN → S(-) A(✓) R(-) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It must contain S and R somewhere.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- Forbidden letters so far: O, E, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- S and R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5 for S; positions 1, 4, or 5 for R).
- No O, E, I, N.

Candidate words:
- CARSY – but Y is uncommon and S is in position 4 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).
- DRABS – but B is new, S in 4 (allowed), R in 2 (forbidden).
- TRASH – T, R, A, S, H. A is in 2 (good), S is in 4 (allowed), R is in 3 (forbidden).
- CRASH – C, R, A, S, H. R in 2 (forbidden).
- GRASP – G, R, A, S, P. R in 2 (forbidden).
- STARK – S in 1 (forbidden).
- CARTS – C, A, R, T, S. A in 2 (good), S in 5 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).
- DARTS – R in 3 (forbidden).
- MARSY – M, A, R, S, Y. A in 2 (good), S in 4 (allowed), R in 3 (forbidden).

None of these fit. Let’s list positions:

Pattern: _ A _ _ _
S must be in 3, 4, or 5.
R must be in 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).

Possible overlaps:
- If S is in 4, R can be in 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3, R can be in 1 or 5.
- If S is in 5, R can be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try:
- R A S _ _ → but S would be in 3 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed). Need two more letters, no O/E/I/N. R A S _ _ → RASPY? Y is okay, but P is new. RASPY – R(1), A(2), S(3), P(4), Y(5). No forbidden letters, fits all constraints.

RASPY:
- A in 2 (confirmed ✓).
- S in 3 (was 1st and 4th, now 3rd – allowed).
- R in 1 (was 2nd and 3rd, now 1st – allowed).
- P and Y are new letters, no conflict with forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

3. RASPY → R(✓) A(✓) S(-) P(x) Y(x)
   - R is confirmed in position 1.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.
   - P and Y are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- The word has the pattern R A _ _ _
- It must contain S somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since S cannot be in 1, 2, 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: O, E, I, N, P, Y.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""RA"" and ending with ""S"" or having ""S"" in position 4, using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- R A _ S _
- R A _ _ S

Looking at common words:
- R A B S _ → no common word.
- R A C S _ → no common word.
- R A D S _ → no common word.
- R A F S _ → no common word.
- R A G S _ → no common word.
- R A H S _ → no common word.
- R A K S _ → no common word.
- R A L S _ → no common word.
- R A M S _ → no common word.
- R A T S _ → RATS_ – but ""RATS"" is only 4 letters.
- R A U S _ → no common word.
- R A V S _ → no common word.
- R A W S _ → no common word.
- R A Z S _ → no common word.

Looking at ""R A _ _ S"":
- R A B E S – but E is forbidden.
- R A C E S – E forbidden.
- R A D E S – E forbidden.
- R A F E S – E forbidden.
- R A G E S – E forbidden.
- R A H E S – E forbidden.

- R A M E S – E forbidden.
- R A T E S – E forbidden.
- R A V E S – E forbidden.
- R A W E S – E forbidden.
- R A Z E S – E forbidden.

None of these work. Let’s try ""R A _ S _"":
- R A B S _ – no common word.
- R A C S _ – no common word.
- R A D S _ – no common word.
- R A F S _ – no common word.
- R A G S _ – no common word.
- R A H S _ – no common word.

- R A M S _ – no common word.
- R A T S _ – no common word.
- R A V S _ – no common word.
- R A W S _ – no common word.
- R A Z S _ – no common word.

Hmm, seems like common words are scarce. Let me think of less common words or check if I missed any.

Looking at ""R A _ _ S"" again with remaining letters:
- R A B S _ – no.
- R A C S _ – no.
- R A D S _ – no.
- R A F S _ – no.
- R A G S _ – no.
- R A H S _ – no.

- R A M S _ – no.
- R A T S _ – no.
- R A V S _ – no.
- R A W S _ – no.
- R A Z S _ – no.

Wait, what about ""R A D I S""? But I is forbidden.

""R A M P S"" – P is forbidden.

""R A C K S"" – K is allowed, but is ""RACKS"" a word? Yes, it is.

Check ""RACKS"":
- R A C K S
- Pattern: R(1) A(2) C(3) K(4) S(5)
- Contains S in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1,2,3 but can be 4 or 5).
- All letters are allowed (C, K not forbidden).
- This seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- R in 1: confirmed ✓
- A in 2: confirmed ✓
- S in 5: allowed (not in 1,2,3,4)
- C and K: new letters, no conflict.

Thus, ""RACKS"" is a valid guess.

We now have the following confirmed information:

- Pattern: R A _ _ S
- Forbidden letters so far: O, E, I, N, P, Y, C, K, M, B
- Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: D, F, G, H, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form R A _ _ S using only the allowed letters in positions 3 and 4.

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common combinations that form valid English words are:

- R A D _ S → ""RADAR"" (but D is in position 4, and A is already in position 2, so ""RADAR"" would be R A D A R - but this has A in position 4, which is allowed, but we need S at the end)
- R A D S _ → No common word ends with S here.
- R A F _ S → ""RAFES"" (but E is forbidden)
- R A G _ S → ""RAGGS"" (but G is allowed, and ""RAGGS"" is a word meaning trousers)
- R A H _ S → ""RAHMS"" (not a word)
- R A L _ S → ""RALMS"" (not a word)
- R A T _ S → ""RATLS"" (not a word)

- R A D I S → I is forbidden
- R A D O S → O is forbidden
- R A D U S → ""RADUS"" is not a word

The only valid word that fits is ""RAGGS"" (R A G G S), even though it's a bit uncommon. It's the only remaining common word that fits the pattern and letter constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""RAGGS"".
