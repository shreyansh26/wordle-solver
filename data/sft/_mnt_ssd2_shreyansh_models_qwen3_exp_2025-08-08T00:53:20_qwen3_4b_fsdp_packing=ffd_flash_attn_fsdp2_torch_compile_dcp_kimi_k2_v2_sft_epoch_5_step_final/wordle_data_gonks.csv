### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that includes several of these common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Some good first guesses include:
- ARISE
- STARE
- RAISE
- AROSE
- ARISE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, or E.

We now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, I, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to gain maximum information.

Common letters not yet eliminated: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J.

A good next guess should combine S with other high-frequency remaining letters. Possible candidates:
- STUNG (S, T, U, N, G) - but U and N are good choices.
- SOUND (S, O, U, N, D) - but O and U are good.
- SHOWN (S, H, O, W, N) - but H, O, W are good.
- SLUMP (S, L, U, M, P) - but L, U, M, P are good.

I'll choose ""STUNG"" as it includes S (not in position 4), T, U, N, G - all common and not yet eliminated.

   ⇒ T, U are absent.  
   ⇒ N is in the word but not in position 4.

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, I, E, T, U  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 4  
- Positions ruled out for N: 4  
- Positions ruled out for G: 5

Remaining common letters that have not been tested: O, L, C, D, P, M, H, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, N, G exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, I, E, T, U.  
- S is not in position 1 or 4.  
- N is not in position 4.  
- G is not in position 5.

Possible placements for S: positions 2, 3, 5  
Possible placements for N: positions 1, 2, 3, 5  
Possible placements for G: positions 1, 2, 3, 4  

Let’s try to place them without repeating letters and while using other untested common letters (O, L, C, D, etc.).

A promising pattern:  
G _ S N _   or   _ G S N _   or   _ S G N _   etc.

Testing a concrete word:  
GSOND – but D is allowed, but GSOND isn’t a valid English word.  
GNOSH – contains H (untested), and fits: G, N, O, S, H.  
Check constraints:  
- Letters: G, N, O, S, H – all allowed so far.  
- S is in position 4 → but feedback said S is not in position 4 (from ARISE). So GNOSH is invalid.  

Next candidate:  
SONGS – but repeats S, and G is in position 5 which is invalid.  

Next:  
GONDS – not a valid word.  

Next:  
GHOST – contains T (already ruled out).  

Next:  
GONYS – not a valid word.

GLONS – not a valid word.  

Next:

GONNA – contains A (ruled out).  

Next:  
GONKS – K is allowed, word is valid. Check constraints:  
G(1), O(2), N(3), K(4), S(5).  
- S is in position 5 – allowed (only positions 1 and 4 ruled out).  
- N is in position 3 – allowed (only position 4 ruled out).  
- G is in position 1 – allowed (only position 5 ruled out).  
- Letters used: G, O, N, K, S – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, I, E, T, U) appear.  

Thus, GONKS satisfies all constraints.
