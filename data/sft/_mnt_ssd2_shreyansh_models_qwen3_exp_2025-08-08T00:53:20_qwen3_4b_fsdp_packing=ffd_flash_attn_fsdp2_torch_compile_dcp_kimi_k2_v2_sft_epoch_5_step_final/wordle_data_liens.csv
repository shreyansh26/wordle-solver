### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not.

Some common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would use several of these letters without repeating any letters, as this gives us more unique feedback.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters and will likely provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- DOES contain S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and E (since they’re in the word).
2. Moves S away from position 4 and E away from position 5.
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (since A, R, O are out).

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B.

A balanced word that re-uses S and E while bringing in fresh letters is “STEIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4).
- E is now in position 2 (was 5).
- Introduces T, I, N (all new and common).

This should give us maximum new information.

From the feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- L in position 1 (✓)
- I in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)

Letters known to be in the word but in wrong positions:
- N (from LINES feedback: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 4)

So the word structure is: L I E _ S and must contain N somewhere. The only remaining position for N is position 4.

Therefore, the word must be L I E N S.

Let's verify:
- L, I, E, S are all confirmed in their correct positions.
- N is confirmed in the word and must fit in position 4.

This forms the word ""LIENS"".
