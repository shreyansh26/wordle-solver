For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is NOT in position 3
- S is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, S, or E
- Still has 5 letters; we need to place R and O correctly while avoiding A/S/E

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already confirmed)

Let’s build a new word:
- R must be placed somewhere other than position 2
- O must be placed somewhere other than position 3
- Avoid A, S, E

Guess 2: R O U N D  
Feedback: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)

What we know so far:
- The word contains O in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- The word contains R, but R is NOT in position 1 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 2 (from Guess 1). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does NOT contain A, S, E, U, N, D.
- The word has 5 letters with O fixed in position 2: _ O _ _ _

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- No A, S, E, U, N, D

Possible patterns: _ O R _ _ , _ O _ R _ , _ O _ _ R

Let’s think of common words fitting _ O R _ _:
- CORGI (but G and I are possible)
- FORGE (but E is out)
- HORSE (but S and E are out)
- MORAL (but A and L are possible, but A is out)
- PORTY (but T and Y are possible)

Actually, let’s focus on _ O _ R _ or _ O _ _ R.

Looking at _ O _ R _:
- BORIC (but C is possible)
- FOCAL (but A is out)
- HOMER (but E is out)

Looking at _ O _ _ R:
- COMER (but E is out)
- FOCOR (not a word)
- MOMOR (not a word)
- TOTOR (not a word)

Wait, let’s think of _ O R _ _ again:
- CORGI (C, G, I are possible)
- FORGO (but G and O are possible, but O is already in position 2)
- HORSE (but S and E are out)
- MORPH (but H and P are possible)
- PORCH (but C and H are possible)

Actually, let’s try ""FORGO"":
- F, O, R, G, O – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if O repeats. Also, G is possible.
But ""FORGO"" has O in position 2 and 5, which might be possible.

But let’s think of words without repeating O or with single O.

Another approach: since R must be in 3,4,5 and O is in 2, let’s try _ O _ _ R:
- COMER (E is out)
- FOCOR (not a word)
- MOMOR (not a word)
- TOTOR (not a word)

Hmm, maybe _ O _ R _:
- BORIC (C is possible, but I is possible)
- FOCAL (A is out)
- HOMER (E is out)

Wait, let’s try ""BORIC"":
- B, O, R, I, C – none of these letters (except O) have been ruled out.
This fits _ O R _ _ with O in 2, R in 3, and B, I, C new.

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Another option: ""HORSE"" – but S and E are out.
""PORCH"" – but C and H are possible, and it’s _ O _ _ R.

Wait, ""PORCH"" has O in 2, R in 3, and C and H in 4 and 5. This seems valid.

But let’s check if any letters are ruled out:
- P, O, R, C, H – none of these were in the previous guesses except O and R, and they weren’t ruled out for these positions.

So ""PORCH"" seems like a good next guess to test P, C, H and place R in 3.

But let me double-check:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from Guess 2)
- R is in position 3 (new position not ruled out)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

- Still has 5 letters; we need to place R and O correctly while avoiding A/S/E

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already confirmed)

Let’s build a new word:
- R must be placed somewhere other than position 2
- O must be placed somewhere other than position 3
- Avoid A, S, E

Possible candidates: TRICK, ROUND, CROOK, DRIFT, etc.

I’ll choose “ROUND”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since it was not in position 2)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since it was not in position 3)
- U, N, D are new letters that haven’t been tested

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)

Guess 2: R O U N D  
Feedback: R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)

What we know so far:
- The word contains O in position 2 (from Guess 2).
- The word contains R, but R is NOT in position 1 (from Guess 2) and NOT in position 2 (from Guess 1). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does NOT contain A, S, E, U, N, D.
- The word has 5 letters with O fixed in position 2: _ O _ _ _

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- No A, S, E, U, N, D

Possible patterns: _ O R _ _ , _ O _ R _ , _ O _ _ R

Let’s think of common words fitting _ O R _ _:
- CORGI (but G and I are possible)
- FORGE (but E is out)
- HORSE (but S and E are out)
- MORAL (but A and L are possible, but A is out)
- PORTY (but T and Y are possible)

Actually, let’s focus on _ O _ R _ or _ O _ _ R.

Looking at _ O _ R _:
- BORIC (but C is possible)
- FOCAL (but A is out)
- HOMER (but E is out)

Looking at _ O _ _ R:
- COMER (but E is out)
- FOCOR (not a word)
- MOMOR (not a word)
- TOTOR (not a word)

Wait, let’s think of _ O R _ _ again:
- CORGI (C, G, I are possible)
- FORGO (but G and O are possible, but O is already in position 2)
- HORSE (but S and E are out)
- MORPH (but H and P are possible)
- PORCH (but C and H are possible)

Actually, let’s try ""FORGO"":
- F, O, R, G, O – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if O repeats. Also, G is possible.
But ""FORGO"" has O in position 2 and 5, which might be possible.

But let’s think of words without repeating O or with single O.

Another approach: since R must be in 3,4,5 and O is in 2, let’s try _ O _ _ R:
- COMER (E is out)
- FOCOR (not a word)
- MOMOR (not a word)
- TOTOR (not a word)

Hmm, maybe _ O _ R _:
- BORIC (C is possible, but I is possible)
- FOCAL (A is out)
- HOMER (E is out)

Wait, let’s try ""BORIC"":
- B, O, R, I, C – none of these letters (except O) have been ruled out.
This fits _ O R _ _ with O in 2, R in 3, and B, I, C new.

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Another option: ""HORSE"" – but S and E are out.
""PORCH"" – but C and H are possible, and it’s _ O _ _ R.

Wait, ""PORCH"" has O in 2, R in 3, and C and H in 4 and 5. This seems valid.

But let’s check if any letters are ruled out:
- P, O, R, C, H – none of these were in the previous guesses except O and R, and they weren’t ruled out for these positions.

So ""PORCH"" seems like a good next guess to test P, C, H and place R in 3.

But let me double-check:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from Guess 2)
- R is in position 3 (new position not ruled out)
- P, C, H are new letters
- No A, S, E, U, N, D

Yes, ""PORCH"" fits all constraints.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so R is NOT in position 2
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is NOT in position 3
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, S, or E
- Still has 5 letters; we need to place R and O correctly while avoiding A/S/E

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, B, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and E are out; O is already confirmed)

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should focus on common ones).

Actually, let’s try ""FORGO"":
- F, O, R, G, O – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if O repeats. Also, G is possible.
But ""FORGO"" has O in position 2 and 5, which might be possible.

But let’s think of words without repeating O or with single O.

This fits _ O R _ _ with O in 2, R in 3, and B, I, C new.

But let’s see if we can find a more common word.

Another option: ""HORSE"" – but S and E are out.

But let’s check if any letters are ruled out:
- P, O, R, C, H – none of these were in the previous guesses except O and R, and they weren’t ruled out for these positions.

So ""PORCH"" seems like a good next guess to test P, C, H and place R in 3.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A, S, E are not in the word.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

3. PORCH → P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x)
   - P is in position 1 (✓).
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - C and H are not in the word.

4. PORGY → P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
   - P, O, R are in their correct positions.
   - G is not in the word.
   - Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word structure is: P O R _ Y

Letters ruled out for position 4: A, S, E, U, N, D, C, H, G

Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, F, I, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit P O R _ Y:
- PORTY (but T is possible)
- PORKY (K is possible)
- PORRY (R is already in position 3, but double R might be possible)

""PORRY"" is a valid word (Scottish for a hill or a surname), using R again in position 4. However, it's less common.

""PORKY"" is also valid (meaning resembling a porky), using K.

""PORTY"" is valid (Scottish for a port).

Among these, ""PORKY"" seems the most common in word lists.

Let’s go with ""PORKY"".
