### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it slightly covers more unique vowels.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: FIRST → F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)

What we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, F, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: I, R, S  
- I is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5.

So the pattern so far looks like: _ I _ _ _

Remaining letters to place: R and S must fit somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, with the constraints above.

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still available: U (since A, O, E are out and I is fixed)

Let’s look for a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2.
- Contains both R and S somewhere else.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

One straightforward candidate is “WIRIS”:
- W I R I S
- Contains I (position 2 ✓), R, and S.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it wasn’t in 2 or 3 in previous guesses; actually it was in 3 in FIRST, and we know it’s not in 3, so this is invalid).

Oops, that puts R back in position 3, which we know is wrong.

Try “DRIPS”:
- D I R P S
- R is in position 3 (still invalid).

Try “CRISP”:
- C I R I S
- R in 3 (invalid).

Try “BRISK”:
- B I R K S
- R in 3 (invalid).

We need R in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “RIPSS” – but that’s invalid (duplicate S and not a word).

Try “RISKS”:
- R I S K S
- R in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), S in 3 and 5 (but S can only appear once, and we don’t know if it’s allowed twice; also S was not in 3 before, so possible).
- However, S was in 4 in AROSE and in 4 in FIRST, and we know it’s not in 4, so 3 is new.

But let’s check if “RISKS” is a valid word – yes, it is.

Another option: “RISKY” – but Y is new and we don’t know if it’s allowed, and we’d rather test new letters cautiously.

Best simple word seems “RISKS”:
- R I S K S
- R in 1 (new position)
- S in 3 (new position)
- Uses K (new letter to test)

Try “RISKS”:
- R I S K S
- R in 1 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), S in 3 and 5 (but S can only appear once, and we don’t know if it’s allowed twice; also S was not in 3 before, so possible).
- However, S was in 4 in AROSE and in 4 in FIRST, and we know it’s not in 4, so 3 is new.

But let’s check if “RISKS” is a valid word – yes, it is.

Another option: “RISKY” – but Y is new and we don’t know if it’s allowed, and we’d rather test new letters cautiously.

Best simple word seems “RISKS”:
- R I S K S
- R in 1 (new position)
- S in 3 (new position)
- Uses K (new letter to test)",Guess 3: RISKS -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
