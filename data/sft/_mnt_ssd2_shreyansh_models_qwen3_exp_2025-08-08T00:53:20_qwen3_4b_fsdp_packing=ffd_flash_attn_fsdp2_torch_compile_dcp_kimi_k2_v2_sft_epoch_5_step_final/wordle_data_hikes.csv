For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It can quickly reveal information about vowel positions and consonant presence

This gives us maximum information about the secret word's letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that places S and E in different positions and uses other common letters. ""STILE"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not position 4, so allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position; original E was in position 5, so this would be invalid). Oops, that’s no good.

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so let’s try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (allowed, since original E was position 5).
- H and T are new letters to test.

But ""SHEET"" has two E’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

Another option: ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems better for testing new letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, I.

Positions ruled out for these letters:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, N.
- Places S, E, I in positions not yet eliminated.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out; E, I are already in).

Let’s try to place:
- S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

A promising pattern: _ E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4 – but S cannot be in 4).  
Another: _ I _ E _  (I in 2, E in 4) – this seems valid.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ E _ with the remaining letters.  
Possible: ""WIELD"" – but D is okay, L is okay, W is okay.  
However, ""WIELD"" has L and D which are new, but let’s check:
- S must be present, and ""WIELD"" doesn’t have S – bad.

We must include S, E, I.  
Let’s try ""SPIKE"":
- S, P, I, K, E – all allowed letters.
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STEIN feedback).  
Discard.

Try ""CISSE"" – invalid (double S, and E at 5 is disallowed).

Try ""LISPS"" – has S twice, not ideal.

Try ""BESOM"" – O is excluded.

Try ""PIECE"" – double E, double C, but let’s check:
- P, I, E, C, E – double E, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"":
- S, I, E, V, E – double E, E in 5 and 4 – both disallowed.

Try ""FRESH"":
- F, R, E, S, H – but R is excluded.

Try ""SHELF"":
- S, H, E, L, F – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SHINE"":
- S, H, I, N, E – N is excluded.

Try ""SPIKE"" again – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – same problem.

Let’s try ""SLEEK"":
- S, L, E, E, K – double E, E in 4 is okay (not 5), but double E not ideal.

Try ""SLEET"":
- S, L, E, E, T – T excluded.

Try ""SPIRE"" – R excluded.

Try ""SIPED"":
- S, I, P, E, D – positions: S1 (disallowed), I2, P3, E4, D5 – but S in 1 is bad.

Try ""SITED"" – T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – S1 is bad.

Let’s try ""SPEEL"" – not a common word.

Try ""SKEEL"" – not common.

Try ""SLEEK"" again – double E, S1 bad.

Try ""SHEET"" – double E, T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" – S1 bad.

Let’s try ""SIEF"" – too short.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for S, E, I:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

And we need two more distinct letters from the remaining set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any used.

Let’s try to construct:

Option: S in 2, E in 4, I in 1: I S _ E _  
Need two more letters, not A, R, O, T, N.  
Possible: I S L E D – ""ISLED"" – not a word.  
I S L E Y – ""ISLEY"" – not common.  
I S B E L – not a word.

Option: S in 3, E in 1, I in 2: E I S _ _  
Need two letters: E I S _ _ – possible: E I S E N – but N excluded.  
E I S E L – double E, but E in 1 is allowed, but we already have E in 1 and need another letter.  
E I S E N – invalid.  
E I S E T – T excluded.

Option: S in 3, E in 4, I in 1: I _ S E _  
Need two letters: I _ S E _ – possible: I N S E T – N, T excluded.

E H S I – too short.  
E L S I – ""ELSI"" – too short.

Option: S in 3, E in 4, I in 2: _ I S E _

D I S E N – N excluded.

Option: S in 5, E in 3, I in 1: I _ E _ S

I L E C S – ""ILECS"" – no.  
I P E C S – ""IPECS"" – no.

Option: S in 5, E in 3, I in 2: _ I E _ S  
Need two letters: _ I E _ S – possible: P I E C S – ""PIECS"" – plural of piece, valid.  
Check letters: P, I, E, C, S – all allowed (P, I, E, C, S not in excluded set).  
Check positions:  
- S in 5 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5).  
- E in 3 – allowed (E can be in 1,3,4).  
- I in 2 – allowed (I can be in 1,2,3,5).  
No conflicts.

Thus, ""PIECS"" is a valid next guess.

- S, P, I, K, E – all allowed letters.
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STEIN feedback).  
Discard.

Try ""CISSE"" – invalid (double S, and E at 5 is disallowed).

Try ""LISPS"" – has S twice, not ideal.

Try ""BESOM"" – O is excluded.

Try ""PIECE"" – double E, double C, but let’s check:

Try ""SPIKE"" again – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – same problem.

Let’s try ""SLEEK"":
- S, L, E, E, K – double E, E in 4 is okay (not 5), but double E not ideal.

Try ""SLEET"":

Try ""SPIRE"" – R excluded.

Try ""SIPED"":

Let’s try ""SPEEL"" – not a common word.

Try ""SKEEL"" – not common.

Try ""SLEEK"" again – double E, S1 bad.

Try ""SHEET"" – double E, T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" – S1 bad.

Let’s try ""SIEF"" – too short.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for S, E, I:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

And we need two more distinct letters from the remaining set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any used.

Let’s try to construct:

Option: S in 2, E in 4, I in 1: I S _ E _

Possible: I S L E D – ""ISLED"" – not a word.

Option: S in 5, E in 3, I in 2: _ I E _ S  
Need two letters: _ I E _ S – possible: P I E C S – ""PIECS"" – plural of piece, valid.  
Check letters: P, I, E, C, S – all allowed (P, I, E, C, S not in excluded set).  
Check positions:  
- S in 5 – allowed (S can be in 2,3,5).  
- E in 3 – allowed (E can be in 1,3,4).

No conflicts.

Thus, ""PIECS"" is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: PIECS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(✓) E(-) C(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It can quickly reveal information about vowel positions and consonant presence

This gives us maximum information about the secret word's letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that places S and E in different positions and uses other common letters. ""STILE"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not position 4, so allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position; original E was in position 5, so this would be invalid). Oops, that’s no good.

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so let’s try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (allowed, since original E was position 5).
- H and T are new letters to test.

But ""SHEET"" has two E’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

Another option: ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems better for testing new letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, I.

Positions ruled out for these letters:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, N.
- Places S, E, I in positions not yet eliminated.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out; E, I are already in).

Let’s try to place:
- S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

A promising pattern: _ E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4 – but S cannot be in 4).  
Another: _ I _ E _  (I in 2, E in 4) – this seems valid.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ E _ with the remaining letters.  
Possible: ""WIELD"" – but D is okay, L is okay, W is okay.  
However, ""WIELD"" has L and D which are new, but let’s check:
- S must be present, and ""WIELD"" doesn’t have S – bad.

We must include S, E, I.  
Let’s try ""SPIKE"":
- S, P, I, K, E – all allowed letters.
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STEIN feedback).  
Discard.

Try ""CISSE"" – invalid (double S, and E at 5 is disallowed).

Try ""LISPS"" – has S twice, not ideal.

Try ""BESOM"" – O is excluded.

Try ""PIECE"" – double E, double C, but let’s check:
- P, I, E, C, E – double E, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"":
- S, I, E, V, E – double E, E in 5 and 4 – both disallowed.

Try ""FRESH"":
- F, R, E, S, H – but R is excluded.

Try ""SHELF"":
- S, H, E, L, F – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SHINE"":
- S, H, I, N, E – N is excluded.

Try ""SPIKE"" again – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – same problem.

Let’s try ""SLEEK"":
- S, L, E, E, K – double E, E in 4 is okay (not 5), but double E not ideal.

Try ""SLEET"":
- S, L, E, E, T – T excluded.

Try ""SPIRE"" – R excluded.

Try ""SIPED"":
- S, I, P, E, D – positions: S1 (disallowed), I2, P3, E4, D5 – but S in 1 is bad.

Try ""SITED"" – T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – S1 is bad.

Let’s try ""SPEEL"" – not a common word.

Try ""SKEEL"" – not common.

Try ""SLEEK"" again – double E, S1 bad.

Try ""SHEET"" – double E, T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" – S1 bad.

Let’s try ""SIEF"" – too short.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for S, E, I:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

And we need two more distinct letters from the remaining set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any used.

Let’s try to construct:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It can quickly reveal information about vowel positions and consonant presence

This gives us maximum information about the secret word's letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that places S and E in different positions and uses other common letters. ""STILE"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not position 4, so allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position; original E was in position 5, so this would be invalid). Oops, that’s no good.

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so let’s try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (allowed, since original E was position 5).
- H and T are new letters to test.

But ""SHEET"" has two E’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

Another option: ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems better for testing new letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, I.

Positions ruled out for these letters:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, N.
- Places S, E, I in positions not yet eliminated.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out; E, I are already in).

Let’s try to place:
- S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

A promising pattern: _ E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4 – but S cannot be in 4).  
Another: _ I _ E _  (I in 2, E in 4) – this seems valid.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ E _ with the remaining letters.  
Possible: ""WIELD"" – but D is okay, L is okay, W is okay.  
However, ""WIELD"" has L and D which are new, but let’s check:
- S must be present, and ""WIELD"" doesn’t have S – bad.

We must include S, E, I.  
Let’s try ""SPIKE"":
- S, P, I, K, E – all allowed letters.
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STEIN feedback).  
Discard.

Try ""CISSE"" – invalid (double S, and E at 5 is disallowed).

Try ""LISPS"" – has S twice, not ideal.

Try ""BESOM"" – O is excluded.

Try ""PIECE"" – double E, double C, but let’s check:
- P, I, E, C, E – double E, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"":
- S, I, E, V, E – double E, E in 5 and 4 – both disallowed.

Try ""FRESH"":
- F, R, E, S, H – but R is excluded.

Try ""SHELF"":
- S, H, E, L, F – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SHINE"":
- S, H, I, N, E – N is excluded.

Try ""SPIKE"" again – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – same problem.

Let’s try ""SLEEK"":
- S, L, E, E, K – double E, E in 4 is okay (not 5), but double E not ideal.

Try ""SLEET"":
- S, L, E, E, T – T excluded.

Try ""SPIRE"" – R excluded.

Try ""SIPED"":
- S, I, P, E, D – positions: S1 (disallowed), I2, P3, E4, D5 – but S in 1 is bad.

Try ""SITED"" – T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – S1 is bad.

Let’s try ""SPEEL"" – not a common word.

Try ""SKEEL"" – not common.

Try ""SLEEK"" again – double E, S1 bad.

Try ""SHEET"" – double E, T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" – S1 bad.

Let’s try ""SIEF"" – too short.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for S, E, I:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

And we need two more distinct letters from the remaining set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any used.

Let’s try to construct:

Possible: I S L E D – ""ISLED"" – not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It can quickly reveal information about vowel positions and consonant presence

This gives us maximum information about the secret word's letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try a word that places S and E in different positions and uses other common letters. ""STILE"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (not position 4, so allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position; original E was in position 5, so this would be invalid). Oops, that’s no good.

Let me rethink. E cannot be in position 5, so let’s try ""SHEET"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in positions 2 and 4 (allowed, since original E was position 5).
- H and T are new letters to test.

But ""SHEET"" has two E’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

Another option: ""STEIN"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- E in position 2 (allowed).
- T, I, N are new letters.

This seems better for testing new letters and positions.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, I.

Positions ruled out for these letters:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, I exactly once each.
- Does not contain A, R, O, T, N.
- Places S, E, I in positions not yet eliminated.

Remaining common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out; E, I are already in).

Let’s try to place:
- S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- I in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

A promising pattern: _ E _ S _  (E in 2, S in 4 – but S cannot be in 4).  
Another: _ I _ E _  (I in 2, E in 4) – this seems valid.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ E _ with the remaining letters.  
Possible: ""WIELD"" – but D is okay, L is okay, W is okay.  
However, ""WIELD"" has L and D which are new, but let’s check:
- S must be present, and ""WIELD"" doesn’t have S – bad.

We must include S, E, I.  
Let’s try ""SPIKE"":
- S, P, I, K, E – all allowed letters.
- S in 1 – but S cannot be in 1 (from STEIN feedback).  
Discard.

Try ""CISSE"" – invalid (double S, and E at 5 is disallowed).

Try ""LISPS"" – has S twice, not ideal.

Try ""BESOM"" – O is excluded.

Try ""PIECE"" – double E, double C, but let’s check:
- P, I, E, C, E – double E, and E in 5 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"":
- S, I, E, V, E – double E, E in 5 and 4 – both disallowed.

Try ""FRESH"":
- F, R, E, S, H – but R is excluded.

Try ""SHELF"":
- S, H, E, L, F – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SHINE"":
- S, H, I, N, E – N is excluded.

Try ""SPIKE"" again – S in 1 is disallowed.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – same problem.

Let’s try ""SLEEK"":
- S, L, E, E, K – double E, E in 4 is okay (not 5), but double E not ideal.

Try ""SLEET"":
- S, L, E, E, T – T excluded.

Try ""SPIRE"" – R excluded.

Try ""SIPED"":
- S, I, P, E, D – positions: S1 (disallowed), I2, P3, E4, D5 – but S in 1 is bad.

Try ""SITED"" – T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" again – S1 is bad.

Let’s try ""SPEEL"" – not a common word.

Try ""SKEEL"" – not common.

Try ""SLEEK"" again – double E, S1 bad.

Try ""SHEET"" – double E, T excluded.

Try ""SIEVE"" – S1 bad.

Let’s try ""SIEF"" – too short.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for S, E, I:

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

And we need two more distinct letters from the remaining set: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z} minus any used.

- E in 3 – allowed (E can be in 1,3,4).  
- I in 2 – allowed (I can be in 1,2,3,5).  
No conflicts.

Thus, ""PIECS"" is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, T, N, P, C

Letters that ARE in the word:
I (correct in position 2)
S (correct in position 5)

Letters still “somewhere in the word but not yet placed”:
E (was in positions 2,3,5 in previous guesses and always marked “-”, so E cannot be in 2,3,5; therefore E must be in position 1 or 4)

So far the word looks like:
[1 or 4]  I  [1,2,3,4]  [1,2,3,4]  S

We need to place E in either position 1 or 4, and fill the remaining two slots with letters that have NOT been eliminated (i.e., not A, R, O, T, N, P, C).

Remaining common letters (alphabet minus the banned ones and the two already placed I, S):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
(plus E, which we’ll place in 1 or 4)

Case 1: E in position 1
Then the pattern is:
E  I  [1,2,3,4]  [1,2,3,4]  S
Remaining letters to fill positions 3 and 4 must be from the allowed set.

Case 2: E in position 4
Then the pattern is:
[1,2,3]  I  [1,2,3]  E  S
Remaining letters to fill positions 1 and 3 must be from the allowed set.

Let’s look for common English 5-letter words that fit either pattern.

Case 1: E I _ _ S
Possible words:
- EIGHTS – T is banned.
- E I D L S – not a word.
- E I G H S – H is allowed, but “EIGHS” is not a common word.
- E I G H S – already noted.
- E I G H S – no valid word.

Case 2: _ I _ E S
Looking for _ I _ E S:
- B I D E S – “BIDES” is a valid word (plural of bide).
- D I V E S – “DIVES” is valid.
- F I V E S – “FIVES” is valid.
- G I V E S – “GIVES” is valid.
- H I K E S – “HIKES” is valid.
- L I V E S – “LIVES” is valid.
- M I D E S – “MIDES” is valid (plural of midis).
- W I D E S – “WIDES” is valid.

Among these, “DIVES”, “FIVES”, “GIVES”, “LIVES”, “HIKES” are all common.

Let’s pick one: “DIVES”.

Check:
D, I, V, E, S
- All letters allowed (D, I, V, E, S not in banned set).
- I in position 2 ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E must be in 1 or 4) ✓
- No banned letters used.

From the four rounds we now have:

Known facts:
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are locked: I E S
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, P, C, D, V
- The word pattern is: _ I _ E S

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) for positions 1 and 3:
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting: ? I ? E S

Common words that fit:
- B I K E S
- F I L E S
- G I V E S (but V is banned)
- H I K E S
- L I N E S (N is banned)
- M I N E S (N is banned)
- W I D E S (D is banned)
- F I V E S (V is banned)
- G I V E S (V is banned)
- B I L E S – not common
- H I L E S – not a word
- F I L E S – valid and common

Between BIKES and FILES, both are valid. BIKES uses B and K; FILES uses F and L. Both are equally valid guesses.

Let’s choose BIKES first.

From the five guesses we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: must be a letter that has NOT been ruled out.
Position 2: I (✓)
Position 3: K (✓)
Position 4: E (✓)
Position 5: S (✓)

Letters already excluded (x in any position): A, R, O, T, N, P, C, D, V, B.

The only remaining letter that can fit position 1 and still make a valid English word is F.

Word: F I K E S → ""FIKES"" is not a standard English word, but ""FIKES"" is listed in some Scrabble dictionaries. However, the more common word that fits is ""FIKES"" itself. But ""FIKES"" is rare.

Wait, let me double-check: the only common English word that matches _ I K E S is ""FIKES"" (a surname/Scrabble word) and ""HIKES"" (but H was never excluded). 

Looking back: H has never been used or excluded. The pattern is _ I K E S. The valid common word is ""HIKES"".

But in our feedback, position 3 is K (✓), so the word must be _ I K E S. The only common word is ""HIKES"".

However, in Guess 5 (BIKES), K was marked ✓ in position 3, so the word must have K in position 3. Thus, the word must be H I K E S.

But ""HIKES"" is a valid English word and H has never been excluded.

But wait, in Guess 4 (DIVES), V was excluded, but H was never used. So the word must be H I K E S.

But the feedback for BIKES was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which confirms positions 2-5 are correct, and position 1 must be H.

Thus, the only possible word is HIKES.

But why wasn't H excluded? Because it was never used in any guess. So the word must be H I K E S.

But in Guess 5, we used BIKES and got B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which means positions 2-5 are correct, and position 1 must be H.

Therefore, the word must be H I K E S.

But ""HIKES"" is a valid English word.

But looking back at the feedback, in Guess 5, K was marked ✓ in position 3, which matches our earlier feedback.

Thus, the word is H I K E S.

But why didn't we consider H earlier? Because we didn't have any feedback on H. So the word must be HIKES.

But the feedback for Guess 5 was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which means the word is H I K E S.

Thus, the correct word is HIKES.

But wait, the feedback for Guess 5 was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓). This means:
- Position 1: not B (but we don't know if it's H yet)
- Position 2: I is correct
- Position 3: K is correct
- Position 4: E is correct
- Position 5: S is correct

Thus, the word must be _ I K E S, where the first letter is not B. The only common word is HIKES.

Therefore, the correct word is HIKES.

But the feedback for Guess 5 didn't explicitly mark H, but since B was marked x, and no other letter was tested in position 1, H is the only remaining common letter.

Thus, the word must be H I K E S.

But to be sure, let's check: is there any other letter that can start _ I K E S and make a valid word? The possibilities are:
- F I K E S → ""FIKES"" (valid Scrabble word, but rare)
- G I K E S → ""GIKES"" (not a word)
- H I K E S → ""HIKES"" (common)
- L I K E S → ""LIKES"" (but L was never excluded)
- M I K E S → ""MIKES"" (but M was never excluded)
- W I K E S → ""WIKES"" (valid, but rare)

Between ""HIKES"" and ""FIKES"", ""HIKES"" is the more common word and H has never been excluded.

Thus, the correct word is HIKES.

But wait, in Guess 5, we used BIKES and got B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓). This means the word is H I K E S.

Thus, the final answer is HIKES.

But let me check if ""HIKES"" fits all feedback:
- H: never excluded
- I: ✓ in position 2
- K: ✓ in position 3
- E: ✓ in position 4
- S: ✓ in position 5

Yes, this fits perfectly.

Therefore, the word must be HIKES.

<guess>HIKES</guess>",HIKES,"From the five guesses we now know the exact pattern:

Position 1: must be a letter that has NOT been ruled out.
Position 2: I (✓)
Position 3: K (✓)
Position 4: E (✓)
Position 5: S (✓)

Letters already excluded (x in any position): A, R, O, T, N, P, C, D, V, B.

The only remaining letter that can fit position 1 and still make a valid English word is F.

Word: F I K E S → ""FIKES"" is not a standard English word, but ""FIKES"" is listed in some Scrabble dictionaries. However, the more common word that fits is ""FIKES"" itself. But ""FIKES"" is rare.

Wait, let me double-check: the only common English word that matches _ I K E S is ""FIKES"" (a surname/Scrabble word) and ""HIKES"" (but H was never excluded). 

Looking back: H has never been used or excluded. The pattern is _ I K E S. The valid common word is ""HIKES"".

But in our feedback, position 3 is K (✓), so the word must be _ I K E S. The only common word is ""HIKES"".

However, in Guess 5 (BIKES), K was marked ✓ in position 3, so the word must have K in position 3. Thus, the word must be H I K E S.

But ""HIKES"" is a valid English word and H has never been excluded.

But wait, in Guess 4 (DIVES), V was excluded, but H was never used. So the word must be H I K E S.

But the feedback for BIKES was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which confirms positions 2-5 are correct, and position 1 must be H.

Thus, the only possible word is HIKES.

But why wasn't H excluded? Because it was never used in any guess. So the word must be H I K E S.

But in Guess 5, we used BIKES and got B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which means positions 2-5 are correct, and position 1 must be H.

Therefore, the word must be H I K E S.

But ""HIKES"" is a valid English word.

But looking back at the feedback, in Guess 5, K was marked ✓ in position 3, which matches our earlier feedback.

Thus, the word is H I K E S.

But why didn't we consider H earlier? Because we didn't have any feedback on H. So the word must be HIKES.

But the feedback for Guess 5 was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓), which means the word is H I K E S.

Thus, the correct word is HIKES.

But wait, the feedback for Guess 5 was B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓). This means:
- Position 1: not B (but we don't know if it's H yet)
- Position 2: I is correct
- Position 3: K is correct
- Position 4: E is correct
- Position 5: S is correct

Thus, the word must be _ I K E S, where the first letter is not B. The only common word is HIKES.

Therefore, the correct word is HIKES.

But the feedback for Guess 5 didn't explicitly mark H, but since B was marked x, and no other letter was tested in position 1, H is the only remaining common letter.

Thus, the word must be H I K E S.

But to be sure, let's check: is there any other letter that can start _ I K E S and make a valid word? The possibilities are:
- F I K E S → ""FIKES"" (valid Scrabble word, but rare)
- G I K E S → ""GIKES"" (not a word)
- H I K E S → ""HIKES"" (common)
- L I K E S → ""LIKES"" (but L was never excluded)
- M I K E S → ""MIKES"" (but M was never excluded)
- W I K E S → ""WIKES"" (valid, but rare)

Between ""HIKES"" and ""FIKES"", ""HIKES"" is the more common word and H has never been excluded.

Thus, the correct word is HIKES.

But wait, in Guess 5, we used BIKES and got B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓). This means the word is H I K E S.

Thus, the final answer is HIKES.

But let me check if ""HIKES"" fits all feedback:
- H: never excluded
- I: ✓ in position 2
- K: ✓ in position 3
- E: ✓ in position 4
- S: ✓ in position 5

Yes, this fits perfectly.

Therefore, the word must be HIKES.",Guess 6: HIKES -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
