### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. The word ends with S (from AROSE feedback).
2. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from UNITS feedback).
3. U, N, T, A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I somewhere other than position 3.

Candidate words:
- WHIPS – contains H, W, P (all allowed) and I in position 2.
- CLIPS – contains C, L, P and I in position 2.
- MISFS – invalid (repeated S).
- GILTS – ends in T, already excluded.
- DIXIE – ends in E, excluded.
- PIXYS – contains P, X, Y and I in position 2.

Among these, “WHIPS” uses four new letters (W, H, P) and the known I, giving maximum information.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far:

1. The word ends in S (from AROSE).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from UNITS and WHIPS feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, W, H, P.
4. Therefore, the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4) must be filled from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

The only possible positions left for I are 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5). But position 5 is already S, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: I is in position 1 → I _ _ _ S
Case 2: I is in position 4 → _ _ _ I S

We need to find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns using only the allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1 (I _ _ _ S):
- Possible words: ILLIS (invalid, repeated L), IMBIS (not a valid word), etc. Not many valid options.

Looking at Case 2 (_ _ _ I S):
- Possible words: BLISS (but L is allowed, S is already fixed, but we have S at 5, so BLISS would be B L I S S which has two S’s – but our word has only one S at position 5, so BLISS is invalid because position 4 would also need to be S, which is not allowed as it would duplicate S in positions 4 and 5 when only one S exists in the word. However, the feedback only tells us about the last letter being S, not whether there are duplicates. So BLISS is possible if the word actually has two S’s. But let’s check other options first.)
- Other options: CLINKS (but K is allowed, N is excluded), FLIMS (but M is allowed), etc.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in S with I in position 4:
- BLISS – but has double S, which may or may not be allowed. The feedback didn’t say anything about duplicates, so it’s possible.
- FLIMS – F, L, I, M, S – all letters allowed and positions valid for I.
- CLIPS – but P is excluded.
- SLIMS – S is already in position 5, and position 1 can’t be S (since S is already at 5 and we don’t know about duplicates). Also, AROSE feedback didn’t indicate duplicates, so we should assume single S at 5.

Between FLIMS and BLISS, FLIMS seems safer as it doesn’t have duplicate letters.

But let’s verify:
- F: allowed
- L: allowed
- I: must be in position 4 (case 2)
- M: allowed
- S: position 5 (correct)

So FLIMS fits all constraints.

Another possible word is CLIPS, but P is excluded. Similarly, SLIMs has S in position 1 which may conflict if the word only has one S.

Thus, FLIMS is a strong candidate.

But wait, let’s double-check the allowed letters:
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z plus I (position 1 or 4), and S (position 5).

FLIMS uses F, L, I, M, S – all allowed, and I is in position 4, which is allowed.

So FLIMS is a valid next guess.

<guess>FLIMS</guess>",FLIMS,"Let’s consolidate everything we know so far:

1. The word ends in S (from AROSE).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from UNITS and WHIPS feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, W, H, P.
4. Therefore, the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4) must be filled from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

The only possible positions left for I are 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5). But position 5 is already S, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: I is in position 1 → I _ _ _ S
Case 2: I is in position 4 → _ _ _ I S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ S and cannot contain A, R, O, or E.

I now need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U.

A strong next guess is “UNITS”:
- Ends in S (matches known info)
- Contains U, N, I, T (none of which are excluded)
- Gives info on four new letters (U, N, I, T) while keeping S fixed in position.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. The word ends with S (from AROSE feedback).
2. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from UNITS feedback).
3. U, N, T, A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining letters must come from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus I (but I can’t be 3rd).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I somewhere other than position 3.

Candidate words:
- WHIPS – contains H, W, P (all allowed) and I in position 2.
- CLIPS – contains C, L, P and I in position 2.
- MISFS – invalid (repeated S).
- GILTS – ends in T, already excluded.
- DIXIE – ends in E, excluded.
- PIXYS – contains P, X, Y and I in position 2.

Among these, “WHIPS” uses four new letters (W, H, P) and the known I, giving maximum information.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far:

1. The word ends in S (from AROSE).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from UNITS and WHIPS feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, W, H, P.
4. Therefore, the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4) must be filled from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

The only possible positions left for I are 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5). But position 5 is already S, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: I is in position 1 → I _ _ _ S
Case 2: I is in position 4 → _ _ _ I S

We need to find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns using only the allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1 (I _ _ _ S):
- Possible words: ILLIS (invalid, repeated L), IMBIS (not a valid word), etc. Not many valid options.

Looking at Case 2 (_ _ _ I S):
- Possible words: BLISS (but L is allowed, S is already fixed, but we have S at 5, so BLISS would be B L I S S which has two S’s – but our word has only one S at position 5, so BLISS is invalid because position 4 would also need to be S, which is not allowed as it would duplicate S in positions 4 and 5 when only one S exists in the word. However, the feedback only tells us about the last letter being S, not whether there are duplicates. So BLISS is possible if the word actually has two S’s. But let’s check other options first.)
- Other options: CLINKS (but K is allowed, N is excluded), FLIMS (but M is allowed), etc.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in S with I in position 4:
- BLISS – but has double S, which may or may not be allowed. The feedback didn’t say anything about duplicates, so it’s possible.
- FLIMS – F, L, I, M, S – all letters allowed and positions valid for I.
- CLIPS – but P is excluded.
- SLIMS – S is already in position 5, and position 1 can’t be S (since S is already at 5 and we don’t know about duplicates). Also, AROSE feedback didn’t indicate duplicates, so we should assume single S at 5.

Between FLIMS and BLISS, FLIMS seems safer as it doesn’t have duplicate letters.

But let’s verify:
- F: allowed
- L: allowed
- I: must be in position 4 (case 2)
- M: allowed
- S: position 5 (correct)

So FLIMS fits all constraints.

Another possible word is CLIPS, but P is excluded. Similarly, SLIMs has S in position 1 which may conflict if the word only has one S.

Thus, FLIMS is a strong candidate.

But wait, let’s double-check the allowed letters:
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z plus I (position 1 or 4), and S (position 5).

FLIMS uses F, L, I, M, S – all allowed, and I is in position 4, which is allowed.

So FLIMS is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on FLIMS:

- F is NOT in the word (x)

- S is in the word and in position 5 (from AROSE), so this feedback S(-) is actually contradictory because earlier feedback already confirmed S is correct in position 5. The symbol ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position, but we know S is definitely in position 5. This suggests the feedback might have been a typo, but assuming the symbols are consistent, we should treat S as definitely in position 5 and ignore the ""-"" for S in FLIMS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ S and cannot contain A, R, O, or E.

I now need a 5-letter word ending in S that avoids those four letters.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U.

A strong next guess is “UNITS”:
- Ends in S (matches known info)
- Contains U, N, I, T (none of which are excluded)
- Gives info on four new letters (U, N, I, T) while keeping S fixed in position.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. The word ends with S (from AROSE feedback).
2. I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from UNITS feedback).
3. U, N, T, A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
and the remaining letters must come from {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus I (but I can’t be 3rd).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains I somewhere other than position 3.

Candidate words:
- WHIPS – contains H, W, P (all allowed) and I in position 2.
- CLIPS – contains C, L, P and I in position 2.
- MISFS – invalid (repeated S).
- GILTS – ends in T, already excluded.
- DIXIE – ends in E, excluded.
- PIXYS – contains P, X, Y and I in position 2.

Among these, “WHIPS” uses four new letters (W, H, P) and the known I, giving maximum information.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far:

1. The word ends in S (from AROSE).
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from UNITS and WHIPS feedback).
3. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, W, H, P.
4. Therefore, the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4) must be filled from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

The only possible positions left for I are 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 2, 3, or 5). But position 5 is already S, so I must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: I is in position 1 → I _ _ _ S
Case 2: I is in position 4 → _ _ _ I S

We need to find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns using only the allowed letters.

Looking at Case 1 (I _ _ _ S):
- Possible words: ILLIS (invalid, repeated L), IMBIS (not a valid word), etc. Not many valid options.

Looking at Case 2 (_ _ _ I S):
- Possible words: BLISS (but L is allowed, S is already fixed, but we have S at 5, so BLISS would be B L I S S which has two S’s – but our word has only one S at position 5, so BLISS is invalid because position 4 would also need to be S, which is not allowed as it would duplicate S in positions 4 and 5 when only one S exists in the word. However, the feedback only tells us about the last letter being S, not whether there are duplicates. So BLISS is possible if the word actually has two S’s. But let’s check other options first.)
- Other options: CLINKS (but K is allowed, N is excluded), FLIMS (but M is allowed), etc.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in S with I in position 4:
- BLISS – but has double S, which may or may not be allowed. The feedback didn’t say anything about duplicates, so it’s possible.
- FLIMS – F, L, I, M, S – all letters allowed and positions valid for I.
- CLIPS – but P is excluded.
- SLIMS – S is already in position 5, and position 1 can’t be S (since S is already at 5 and we don’t know about duplicates). Also, AROSE feedback didn’t indicate duplicates, so we should assume single S at 5.

Between FLIMS and BLISS, FLIMS seems safer as it doesn’t have duplicate letters.

But let’s verify:
- F: allowed
- L: allowed
- I: must be in position 4 (case 2)
- M: allowed
- S: position 5 (correct)

So FLIMS fits all constraints.

Another possible word is CLIPS, but P is excluded. Similarly, SLIMs has S in position 1 which may conflict if the word only has one S.

Thus, FLIMS is a strong candidate.

But wait, let’s double-check the allowed letters:
Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z plus I (position 1 or 4), and S (position 5).

FLIMS uses F, L, I, M, S – all allowed, and I is in position 4, which is allowed.

So FLIMS is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)

Guess 4: FLIMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) I(-) M(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FLIMS:

- F is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from UNITS) and NOT in position 4 (from FLIMS), so I must be in position 1 or 2
- M is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in position 5 (from AROSE), so this feedback S(-) is actually contradictory because earlier feedback already confirmed S is correct in position 5. The symbol ""-"" means it's in the word but wrong position, but we know S is definitely in position 5. This suggests the feedback might have been a typo, but assuming the symbols are consistent, we should treat S as definitely in position 5 and ignore the ""-"" for S in FLIMS.

So, corrected knowledge:
1. Word ends with S (position 5)
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4, so must be in position 1 or 2
3. Excluded letters so far: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, W, H, P, F, L, M
4. Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z plus I in position 1 or 2

Possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ S (I in position 1)
- _ I _ _ S (I in position 2)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- I _ _ _ S: ""IBIS"" is too short, ""ICISS"" invalid, ""IGGYS"" invalid, ""IKONS"" has N excluded, etc. Not many valid options.
- _ I _ _ S: 
  - B I _ _ S: ""BISS"" invalid, ""BIBYS"" invalid
  - C I _ _ S: ""CIGIS"" invalid, ""CIVILS"" too long
  - D I _ _ S: ""DISKS"" has K allowed, S in position 5, but K is allowed
  - G I _ _ S: ""GIGIS"" invalid
  - J I _ _ S: ""JIGIS"" invalid
  - K I _ _ S: ""KILNS"" has L excluded
  - V I _ _ S: ""VIRUS"" has U excluded
  - X I _ _ S: ""XENIS"" invalid
  - Y I _ _ S: ""YOGIS"" has O excluded
  - Z I _ _ S: ""ZIGIS"" invalid

Looking at ""DISKS"":
- D: allowed
- I: allowed in position 2
- S: allowed in position 5
- K: allowed
- Second S: position 4 would need to be S, but we know S is only confirmed in position 5. However, the feedback didn't prohibit duplicates, so it's possible.

Another option: ""CIGIS"" but G is allowed, but ""CIGIS"" isn't a valid word.

""DISKS"" seems the closest valid word fitting the constraints.

“C I K B S” – “CIKBS” invalid
“C I K G S” – “CIGKS” invalid
“C I K V S” – “CIVKS” invalid
“B I K _ S” – “B I K E S” has E excluded
“G I K _ S” – “G I K S” too short
“V I K _ S” – “V I K T S” has T excluded

Try K in position 1:
“K I _ _ S” – “K I B S” too short
“K I C S” too short
“K I G S” too short
“K I V S” too short

Try K in position 4:
“_ I _ K S”
Possible letters for position 1 and 3 from remaining: B, C, G, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z

“C I V K S” – “CIVKS” invalid
“B I V K S” – “BIVKS” invalid
“G I V K S” – “GIVKS” invalid
“V I C K S” – “VICKS” invalid
“C I G K S” – “CIGKS” invalid
“B I G K S” – “BIGKS” invalid
“G I C K S” – “GICKS” invalid
“J I C K S” – “J I C K S” is “JICKS” which is a valid word (slang for jester or to mock)

Check J, I, C, K, S:
- J: allowed
- I: allowed in position 2
- C: allowed
- K: allowed in position 4
- S: allowed in position 5

“JICKS” fits all constraints.",Guess 6: JICKS -> FEEDBACK: J(x) I(✓) C(x) K(-) S(-),FAIL
