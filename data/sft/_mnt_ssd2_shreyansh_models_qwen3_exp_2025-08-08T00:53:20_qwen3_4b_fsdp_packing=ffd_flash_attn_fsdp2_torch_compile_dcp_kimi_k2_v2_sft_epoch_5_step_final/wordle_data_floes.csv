2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it includes S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English words. The combination of S, L, A, T, E covers both vowels and consonants that appear frequently.

Between these two, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage (A, O, E vs A, E in SLATE), and includes R and S which are very common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3 is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- It contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5)
- It does not contain A or R

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5 (since it can't be in 4)
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 3 is O, so 1, 2, 4)

Let's think of words that fit _ _ O _ _ with S and E somewhere, avoiding A and R. Good candidates might be:
- STONE (but has N and T, and E is in position 5 which was marked wrong)
- SHONE (H is possible, E in position 5 again wrong)
- SPOKE (P, K possible, E in position 5 again wrong)
- SLOPE (L, P possible, E in position 5 again wrong)
- STOLE (T, L possible, E in position 5 again wrong)

Looking for words where S and E are not in positions 4 and 5:
- SPOKE: E is in position 5 (wrong)
- SLOPE: E is in position 5 (wrong)
- STONE: E is in position 5 (wrong)
- SHONE: E is in position 5 (wrong)
- STOLE: E is in position 5 (wrong)

Alternative approach: Maybe S is in position 1 or 2, and E is in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible words:
- SOBER (B possible, E in position 5 - no)
- SOWER (W possible, E in position 5 - no)
- SPOKE (E in position 5 - no)
- SLOPE (E in position 5 - no)
- SLOES (double S, E in position 4 - possible)
- SLOES: _ _ O _ _, positions: S(1), L(2), O(3), E(4), S(5). This has S in position 1 and 5, E in 4. This might fit.

Another option:
- SMOKE (M, K possible, E in position 5 - no)
- STEMS (E in position 2, S in position 5 - possible: _ _ O _ _, but S would be in position 5 which was marked wrong for S in position 4, but that doesn't preclude 5)
- STEMS: S in position 1, T, E in position 2, M, S in position 5. This has E in position 2 and S in position 1 and 5. This might fit.

But let's think of words with O in position 3, S and E elsewhere, avoiding A and R.

Another candidate:
- STONE: but E is in position 5 (wrong)
- SLOPE: E in position 5 (wrong)
- SPOKE: E in position 5 (wrong)
- SLOES: E in position 4, S in 1 and 5. This seems possible.

Alternatively:
- SPORE: but R is excluded
- STOKE: E in position 5 (wrong)
- STONE: E in position 5 (wrong)

Looking at SLOES:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) - allowed
- E is in position 4 (not 5) - allowed
- O is in position 3 - correct
- No A or R - correct

This seems like a good next guess to test S and E in new positions while keeping O fixed.

- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Thus the secret word looks like: _ L O E S

We also know from earlier that A and R are NOT in the word.

The only remaining letter to determine is the first letter. It must be a consonant that forms a valid 5-letter English word ending in LOES.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

Valid English words that fit _LOES:
- BLOES – not a recognized word
- CLOES – not standard
- DLOES – not standard
- FLOES – yes, “f loes” is a valid word (plural of floe, a piece of ice)
- GLOES – not standard
- HLOES – not standard
- MLOES – not standard
- NLOES – not standard
- PLOES – not standard
- TLOES – not standard
- WLOES – not standard

The only valid candidate is FLOES.

<guess>FLOES</guess>",FLOES,"From the new feedback on SLOES:
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (and we already knew it’s not in 4).
- L(✓) – L is in the word and already in the correct position (position 2).
- O(✓) – O is in the word and already in the correct position (position 3).
- E(✓) – E is in the word and already in the correct position (position 4).
- S(✓) – S is in the word and already in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern we now know for certain is:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Thus the secret word looks like: _ L O E S
