### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in the 5th position.
   - R and O are somewhere in the word but not in their original positions (R not 2nd, O not 3rd).

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓)
   - O is now confirmed in the 2nd position.
   - T is confirmed in the 4th position.
   - R is still in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - U is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ T E
- Letters to include: R (not 1st or 2nd, so possible 3rd or 4th, but 4th is T) → R must be 3rd.
- Letters to exclude: A, S, U.

Thus the word must be _ O R T E.

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""FROTE"" (though not common), but checking valid words, ""PROTE"" isn't valid. However, ""CORTE"" isn't valid either. Let me reconsider.

Wait, R must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1st, 2nd, or 5th). So the pattern is _ O R T E. The only valid English word fitting this is ""FORTE"" (which is a real word, meaning strong or a musical forte). 

Let me verify:
- F: untested, possible.
- O: confirmed 2nd.
- R: confirmed 3rd (since it must be somewhere and 4th is T).
- T: confirmed 4th.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, which will provide valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E and contains R and O somewhere, but not in the positions they appeared in AROSE (R was 2nd, O was 3rd).  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S.

We now need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R and O, but R not in position 2 and O not in position 3.  
A good next probe is a word that places R and O in new positions while introducing other common letters.  
“ROUTE” fits:
- Ends with E (matches known ✓)
- Contains R and O
- R is now in position 1 (new position)
- O is now in position 2 (new position)
- Introduces U and T, which are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in the 5th position.
   - R and O are somewhere in the word but not in their original positions (R not 2nd, O not 3rd).

2. ROUTE → R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓)
   - O is now confirmed in the 2nd position.
   - T is confirmed in the 4th position.
   - R is still in the word but not in the 1st position.
   - U is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ T E
- Letters to include: R (not 1st or 2nd, so possible 3rd or 4th, but 4th is T) → R must be 3rd.
- Letters to exclude: A, S, U.

Thus the word must be _ O R T E.

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""FROTE"" (though not common), but checking valid words, ""PROTE"" isn't valid. However, ""CORTE"" isn't valid either. Let me reconsider.

Wait, R must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1st, 2nd, or 5th). So the pattern is _ O R T E. The only valid English word fitting this is ""FORTE"" (which is a real word, meaning strong or a musical forte). 

Let me verify:
- F: untested, possible.
- O: confirmed 2nd.
- R: confirmed 3rd (since it must be somewhere and 4th is T).
- T: confirmed 4th.
- E: confirmed 5th.

This seems correct.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- F: untested, possible.
- O: confirmed 2nd.
- R: confirmed 3rd (since it must be somewhere and 4th is T).
- T: confirmed 4th.
- E: confirmed 5th.

This seems correct.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(✓) E(✓)
Guess 3: FORTE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓) E(✓)

From Guess 3 (FORTE) we now have:
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2.
- R(✓) – R is in position 3.
- T(✓) – T is in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in position 5.

So the word pattern is now fully determined: _ O R T E.

We have only the first letter left to discover.  
Letters already ruled out: A, S, U, F.  
Common remaining consonants for the first position: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “ORTE”:
- CORTE (variant spelling, not common)
- HORTE (proper noun, usually not allowed)
- MORTE (archaic)
- PORTE (French loanword, sometimes accepted)
- WORLD list includes “CORTE” but it’s rare.  
The most common and accepted word is “CORTE” (though it’s not in most standard dictionaries). However, the only standard English word fitting _ORTE is “CORTE” (a type of knife). 

But let’s double-check: are there any other common words?  
“PORTE” is not standard. “DORTE” is a name. “GORTE” is not a word.  

Therefore, the only plausible candidate is “CORTE”.

I will guess it.

We now know the exact pattern: _ O R T E  
Letters already ruled out for the first position: A, C, F, S, U.

Remaining common consonants for the first letter: B, D, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “ORTE”:
- BORTE – not a word  
- DORTE – proper noun (name)  
- GORTE – not a word  
- HORTÉ – not standard  
- LORTE – not a word  
- MORTE – archaic spelling of “mortar” or “morte” (used in Scots) but rare  
- NORTÉ – not standard  
- PORTÉ – variant spelling of “porte” (French) but uncommon  
- WORTE – not a word  

The only remaining valid dictionary entry that fits is “MORTE” (Scots spelling of “mortar” or “morte” as a noun). It is accepted in some Scrabble dictionaries and is the only remaining candidate.

Therefore, the next logical guess is MORTE.
