### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, and C. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.

We need to place A, R, E in new positions while introducing new consonants to test. Good candidates to test next might be T, L, N, C, D, etc.

A word that uses A, R, E plus new consonants and respects the positional constraints is ""RATED"":
- R is now in position 1 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 2)
- A is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 1)
- T is a new consonant

This gives us good coverage to narrow down the remaining letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, and C. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain O or S
- Has 5 letters, none of which are O or S

We need to place A, R, E in new positions while introducing new consonants to test. Good candidates to test next might be T, L, N, C, D, etc.

A word that uses A, R, E plus new consonants and respects the positional constraints is ""RATED"":
- R is now in position 1 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 2)
- A is now in position 2 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 1)
- T is a new consonant
- E is now in position 4 (allowed since it was only excluded from position 5)
- D is a new consonant

This gives us good coverage to narrow down the remaining letters.

Looking for common English words: ""RABED"", ""RACED"", ""RAFED"", ""RAGED"", ""RAKED"", ""RANED"", ""RAPED"", ""RAWED"", ""RAYED""  
""RAPED"" is a valid word meaning ""to treat roughly or brutally"".

We now know the word is exactly R A _ E D and that the third letter is **not** P, T, O, S, or C.  
Letters still allowed for position 3 (middle consonant):  
B, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Common 5-letter words of the form R A _ E D with those consonants:

- RAVED  (past tense of rave)  
- RAGED  (past tense of rage)  
- RANED  (rare, but valid)  
- RAKED  (past tense of rake)  
- RAVED  (also a variant spelling)

Between these, “RAVED” and “RAGED” are the most frequent.  
I’ll test “RAVED” next.
