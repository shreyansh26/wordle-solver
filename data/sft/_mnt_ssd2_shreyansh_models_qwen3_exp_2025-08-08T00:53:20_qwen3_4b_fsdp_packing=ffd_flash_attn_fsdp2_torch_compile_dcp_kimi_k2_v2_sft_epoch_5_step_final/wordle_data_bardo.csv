For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain about the secret word. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should provide good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

From the new feedback on RATIO:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word  
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word  
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 5 (exact match)  

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions:
- A is fixed in position 2
- O is fixed in position 5

Letters that are definitely in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- S, E, T, I

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ O

We still need to place R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 1 is now impossible for R, and position 2 is taken by A).

We need two more distinct letters (not S, E, T, I) to fill positions 1 and 3 (or 1 and 4, depending on R’s placement).

Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and O in position 5
- Places R in position 3 (since position 4 is also possible, but let’s test 3 first)
- Uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4

A good candidate is “CABRO”:
- C (new letter) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- B (new letter) in position 3
- R in position 4
- O (fixed) in position 5

However, CABRO might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word instead: “CARBO” is also invalid. Another option: “BARON” – but O is fixed at position 5, so this won’t work.

Let me try “R” in position 3:
Pattern: _ A R _ O

A valid word fitting this is “CARGO”:
- C in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- G in position 4 (new)
- O in position 5 (fixed)

This uses only letters not yet ruled out and places R in position 3.

So my next guess is CARGO.

  – A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden in position 1)  
  – O is in position 5 (allowed, since O was only forbidden in position 3)  
- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us maximal new information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RATIO:

- R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 2 (exact match)  
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word  
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word  
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 5 (exact match)  

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions:
- A is fixed in position 2
- O is fixed in position 5

Letters that are definitely in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- S, E, T, I

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ O

We still need to place R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 1 is now impossible for R, and position 2 is taken by A).

We need two more distinct letters (not S, E, T, I) to fill positions 1 and 3 (or 1 and 4, depending on R’s placement).

Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and O in position 5
- Places R in position 3 (since position 4 is also possible, but let’s test 3 first)
- Uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4

A good candidate is “CABRO”:
- C (new letter) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- B (new letter) in position 3
- R in position 4
- O (fixed) in position 5

However, CABRO might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word instead: “CARBO” is also invalid. Another option: “BARON” – but O is fixed at position 5, so this won’t work.

Let me try “R” in position 3:
Pattern: _ A R _ O

A valid word fitting this is “CARGO”:
- C in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- G in position 4 (new)
- O in position 5 (fixed)

This uses only letters not yet ruled out and places R in position 3.

So my next guess is CARGO.

From the latest feedback on CARGO:

- G(x) → G is not in the word
- O(✓) → O is in position 5 (fixed)

So the pattern is now:
_ A R _ O

Letters already ruled out: S, E, T, I, C, G.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B (new letter)
- Position 4: N (new letter)

This gives the word BARNO. However, BARNO is not a valid English word.

Next option:
- Position 1: M
- Position 4: N

This gives MARN O – but MARN is a valid 4-letter word, so M A R N O would be 5 letters: M A R N O → M A R N O is not a word.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words that fit _ A R _ O:
- B A R D O (valid: BARD is 4 letters, but BARD O isn’t)
- B A R G O (BARGO isn’t valid)
- B A R R O (invalid)
- M A R R O (MARR is 4 letters, MARR O isn’t)
- L A R G O (LARGO is a valid word, meaning a fast tempo in music)

LARGO is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- L (new) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- R (fixed) in position 3
- G (but G was ruled out by CARGO feedback) – oops, G is invalid.

Next valid word: D A R L O (DARLO isn’t valid)
Next: P A R K O (PARCO isn’t valid)
Next: B A R D O (BARD isn’t valid)
Next: F A R M O (FARMO isn’t valid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe position 4 is a vowel. We have used A and O, but E and I are out. U is still possible.

So pattern: _ A R U O

C A R U O – no
D A R U O – no
M A R U O – no
N A R U O – no
P A R U O – no
S A R U O – S is out

P A R N O – P A R N O isn’t valid
L A R N O – L A R N O isn’t valid
F A R N O – F A R N O isn’t valid

Wait, let me check valid 5-letter words ending in “AR_O”:

Valid words:
- BARON – but O is position 5, so B A R O N – but we need O in position 5, so B A R _ O.

Actually, the pattern is _ A R _ O.

- T A R P O – no
- V A R N O – no
- W A R P O – no

This seems problematic. Let me think of valid words with A in position 2 and O in position 5, and R in position 3.

Valid words:
- B A R R O – invalid
- C A R V O – no

Actually, “B A R R O” is invalid, but “B A R D O” isn’t valid either. 

Wait, let me think of words with R in position 3, A in position 2, O in position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters.

Valid word: B A R D O – no
Valid word: M A R K O – but K is new, and R is in position 3, A in 2, O in 5: M A R K O – yes, MARCO is a valid word.

- M (new) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain about the secret word. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are distinct, giving maximum information
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should provide good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3  
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all  
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all  

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E  
- Positions to avoid for A, R, O:  
  – A cannot be in position 1  
  – R cannot be in position 2  
  – O cannot be in position 3  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O somewhere (but not in the forbidden positions above)  
2. Does NOT use S or E  
3. Uses two other letters (not S or E) to fill the remaining two slots  

Good candidate letters (common and unused so far): T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and also places A, R, O in new positions is “RATIO”:
- Letters: R, A, T, I, O  
- Contains A, R, O  
- No S or E  
- Positions:  
  – R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was only forbidden in position 2)  
  – A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was only forbidden in position 1)  
  – O is in position 5 (allowed, since O was only forbidden in position 3)  
- T and I are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us maximal new information.

From the new feedback on RATIO:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word  
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word  
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 5 (exact match)  

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions:
- A is fixed in position 2
- O is fixed in position 5

Letters that are definitely in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
- S, E, T, I

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ O

We still need to place R somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since position 1 is now impossible for R, and position 2 is taken by A).

We need two more distinct letters (not S, E, T, I) to fill positions 1 and 3 (or 1 and 4, depending on R’s placement).

Common remaining consonants: N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and O in position 5
- Places R in position 3 (since position 4 is also possible, but let’s test 3 first)
- Uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4

A good candidate is “CABRO”:
- C (new letter) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- B (new letter) in position 3
- R in position 4
- O (fixed) in position 5

However, CABRO might not be a valid word. Let me think of a valid word instead: “CARBO” is also invalid. Another option: “BARON” – but O is fixed at position 5, so this won’t work.

Let me try “R” in position 3:
Pattern: _ A R _ O

A valid word fitting this is “CARGO”:
- C in position 1 (new)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- G in position 4 (new)
- O in position 5 (fixed)

This uses only letters not yet ruled out and places R in position 3.

So my next guess is CARGO.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(✓)
Guess 3: CARGO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on CARGO:
- C(x) → C is not in the word
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (fixed)
- R(✓) → R is in position 3 (fixed)
- G(x) → G is not in the word
- O(✓) → O is in position 5 (fixed)

So the pattern is now:
_ A R _ O

Letters already ruled out: S, E, T, I, C, G.

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 4. Common remaining consonants: N, L, D, B, M, P, etc.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: B (new letter)
- Position 4: N (new letter)

This gives the word BARNO. However, BARNO is not a valid English word.

Next option:
- Position 1: M
- Position 4: N

This gives MARN O – but MARN is a valid 4-letter word, so M A R N O would be 5 letters: M A R N O → M A R N O is not a word.

Wait, let’s think of valid 5-letter words that fit _ A R _ O:
- B A R D O (valid: BARD is 4 letters, but BARD O isn’t)
- B A R G O (BARGO isn’t valid)
- B A R R O (invalid)
- M A R R O (MARR is 4 letters, MARR O isn’t)
- L A R G O (LARGO is a valid word, meaning a fast tempo in music)

LARGO is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- L (new) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- R (fixed) in position 3
- G (but G was ruled out by CARGO feedback) – oops, G is invalid.

Next valid word: D A R L O (DARLO isn’t valid)
Next: P A R K O (PARCO isn’t valid)
Next: B A R D O (BARD isn’t valid)
Next: F A R M O (FARMO isn’t valid)

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A R _ O:
- B A R R O – invalid
- B A R G O – invalid
- L A R G O – invalid (G is out)
- M A R R O – invalid
- P A R K O – invalid
- D A R L O – invalid
- F A R M O – invalid
- H A R P O – invalid
- K A R L O – invalid
- N A R R O – invalid
- V A R N O – invalid
- W A R P O – invalid

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe position 4 is a vowel. We have used A and O, but E and I are out. U is still possible.

So pattern: _ A R U O

Valid word: B A R U O – no
C A R U O – no
D A R U O – no
M A R U O – no
N A R U O – no
P A R U O – no
S A R U O – S is out
T A R U O – T is out
V A R U O – no
W A R U O – no

Not finding any valid words. Maybe position 1 is a consonant and position 4 is another consonant.

Let me try: B A R D O – no
B A R N O – BARNO isn’t valid
M A R N O – M A R N O isn’t valid
D A R N O – D A R N O isn’t valid
P A R N O – P A R N O isn’t valid
L A R N O – L A R N O isn’t valid
F A R N O – F A R N O isn’t valid

Wait, let me check valid 5-letter words ending in “AR_O”:

Valid words:
- BARON – but O is position 5, so B A R O N – but we need O in position 5, so B A R _ O.

Actually, the pattern is _ A R _ O.

Valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A R _ O:
- B A R D O – no
- B A R G O – no
- B A R N O – BARNO isn’t valid
- C A R N O – no
- D A R N O – no
- F A R N O – no
- H A R P O – no
- K A R N O – no
- L A R N O – no
- M A R N O – no
- N A R R O – no
- P A R K O – no
- R A R D O – no
- S A R D O – no
- T A R P O – no
- V A R N O – no
- W A R P O – no

This seems problematic. Let me think of valid words with A in position 2 and O in position 5, and R in position 3.

Valid words:
- B A R R O – invalid
- C A R V O – no
- D A R L O – no
- F A R M O – no
- H A R P O – no
- K A R L O – no
- L A R G O – no (G is out)
- M A R R O – no
- N A R R O – no
- P A R K O – no
- S A R D O – no
- T A R P O – no
- V A R N O – no
- W A R P O – no

I’m not finding any valid words. Maybe I missed a word. Let me double-check:

Actually, “B A R R O” is invalid, but “B A R D O” isn’t valid either. 

Wait, let me think of words with R in position 3, A in position 2, O in position 5, and positions 1 and 4 filled with new letters.

Valid word: B A R D O – no
Valid word: M A R K O – but K is new, and R is in position 3, A in 2, O in 5: M A R K O – yes, MARCO is a valid word.

Let me check:
- M (new) in position 1
- A (fixed) in position 2
- R (fixed) in position 3
- K (new) in position 4
- O (fixed) in position 5

This fits all constraints:
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (M, K)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (fixed)
- O is in position 5 (fixed)
- No S, E, T, I, C, G

So the next guess is MARCO.
