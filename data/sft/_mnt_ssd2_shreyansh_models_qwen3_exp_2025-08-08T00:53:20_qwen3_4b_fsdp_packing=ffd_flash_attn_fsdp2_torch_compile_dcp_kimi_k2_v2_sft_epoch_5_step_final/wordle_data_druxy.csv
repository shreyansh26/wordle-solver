For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes common letters and both vowels and consonants. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why this is a good first guess:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Contains 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English 5-letter words
- Provides good coverage for eliminating or confirming many letters at once

- A: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (in word and in correct position)

So we know:
1. The word has R in the 2nd position.
2. It does NOT contain A, O, S, or E at all.

We need a 5-letter word with R as the second letter and none of A, O, S, E. Good consonants to try next would be T, N, L, C, etc., and remaining vowels would be I and U.

A good second guess would be something like ""TRIUM"" but that has an O (invalid) and isn't 5 letters. ""TRUNK"" is valid but has an O in the 3rd position. ""FRUIT"" is valid and has no A, O, S, E. Let me check: F-R-U-I-T. This uses R in position 2 and only includes F, R, U, I, T - none of which are A, O, S, E. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""BRICK"" but that has an O in the 3rd position. ""DRINK"" is also good but has an O. ""GRIND"" has an O. ""PRIDE"" has an E. ""TRIPE"" has an E. ""TRIAD"" has an A. ""TRUCK"" has an O. ""FRUIT"" seems the best among these.

- BRUIN (but “bruin” is not a common English word)
- CRUMP (uses P, allowed)
- GRUNT (uses T, already ruled out)
- PRUNE (uses E, ruled out)
- DRUNK (uses K and N, both allowed)
- PRUNE (ruled out)
- BRUNT (uses B, R, U, N, T – T is ruled out)
- TRULY (T ruled out)
- BRUIN (not common)
- CRUMP (valid, uses C, R, U, M, P)

“CRUMP” fits the pattern and only uses allowed letters (C, R, U, M, P).  
Another good option is “DRUNK” but T is ruled out.  
“BRUNT” uses T which is ruled out.  
“FRUIT” already used.  
“PRUNE” uses E.  
“TRUNK” uses T and U is already in correct spot.  
So “CRUMP” seems best.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes common letters and both vowels and consonants. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why this is a good first guess:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Contains 2 high-frequency consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most common in English 5-letter words
- Provides good coverage for eliminating or confirming many letters at once

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (in word and in correct position)
- O: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

So we know:
1. The word has R in the 2nd position.
2. It does NOT contain A, O, S, or E at all.

We need a 5-letter word with R as the second letter and none of A, O, S, E. Good consonants to try next would be T, N, L, C, etc., and remaining vowels would be I and U.

A good second guess would be something like ""TRIUM"" but that has an O (invalid) and isn't 5 letters. ""TRUNK"" is valid but has an O in the 3rd position. ""FRUIT"" is valid and has no A, O, S, E. Let me check: F-R-U-I-T. This uses R in position 2 and only includes F, R, U, I, T - none of which are A, O, S, E. This seems optimal.

Another option is ""BRICK"" but that has an O in the 3rd position. ""DRINK"" is also good but has an O. ""GRIND"" has an O. ""PRIDE"" has an E. ""TRIPE"" has an E. ""TRIAD"" has an A. ""TRUCK"" has an O. ""FRUIT"" seems the best among these.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ R U _ _
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, F, I, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the remaining vowels (but only U is confirmed in position 3; we still need to test for other vowels in other positions)

We have the pattern _ R U _ _ and must use only letters not yet ruled out.  
Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word fitting _ R U _ _ using allowed letters.

Candidate letters for the first and fourth/fifth positions: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- BRUIN (but “bruin” is not a common English word)
- CRUMP (uses P, allowed)
- GRUNT (uses T, already ruled out)
- PRUNE (uses E, ruled out)
- DRUNK (uses K and N, both allowed)
- PRUNE (ruled out)
- BRUNT (uses B, R, U, N, T – T is ruled out)
- TRULY (T ruled out)
- BRUIN (not common)
- CRUMP (valid, uses C, R, U, M, P)

“CRUMP” fits the pattern and only uses allowed letters (C, R, U, M, P).  
Another good option is “DRUNK” but T is ruled out.  
“BRUNT” uses T which is ruled out.  
“FRUIT” already used.  
“PRUNE” uses E.  
“TRUNK” uses T and U is already in correct spot.  
So “CRUMP” seems best.

3. Remaining usable consonants: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
4. Remaining vowels: none (U is already in place; A, O, E, I are ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2 and U in position 3
- Uses only letters from the allowed set
- Is a valid English word

Possible patterns: B R U _, D R U _, G R U _, H R U _, J R U _, K R U _, L R U _, N R U _, V R U _, W R U _, Y R U _

Checking common words:
- BRUNT – uses T (ruled out)
- DRUID – uses I (ruled out)
- GRUNT – uses T (ruled out)
- BRUIN – not common
- TRULY – T and L/Y ok but T ruled out
- PRUNE – P and E ruled out
- FRUIT – already used
- CRUMP – already used

Valid remaining options:
- BRUIN (but uncommon)
- DRUID (I ruled out)
- GRUNT (T ruled out)
- TRULY (T ruled out)
- BRUNT (T ruled out)

Looking again, the only common word left seems ""BRUIN"", but it's not in most dictionaries. However, ""bruin"" is actually a valid Scots word meaning ""brown"". Given the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word left.

Alternatively, ""DRUNK"" was invalid because T is ruled out. ""GRIND"" has I ruled out. 

Thus, ""BRUIN"" is the only viable candidate left.

""PRUNE"" invalid (P, E). \n\nWait, let\'s list all possible combinations with remaining letters:\n\nPossible endings with allowed letters:\n- DRU_K\n- DRU_D\n- DRU_L\n- DRU_V\n- DRU_W\n- DRU_Y\n- DRU_Z\n- GRU_D\n- GRU_L\n- GRU_V\n- GRU_W\n- GRU_Y\n- GRU_Z\n- HRU_D\n- HRU_L\n- HRU_V\n- HRU_W\n- HRU_Y\n- HRU_Z\n- etc.\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- ""DRUID"" – I is invalid\n- ""DRUMS"" – S is invalid\n- ""DRUNK"" – T is invalid\n- ""DRURY"" – not a word\n- ""GRUEL"" – E is invalid\n- ""GRUNT"" – T is invalid\n- ""GRUFF"" – F is invalid\n- ""GRUNT"" – T is invalid\n- ""GRIME"" – M, I, E invalid\n- ""GRIND"" – I, N, D – I and N invalid\n- ""GRUNT"" – T invalid\n- ""PRUNE"" – P, U, N, E – P, E invalid\n- ""TRULY"" – T invalid\n- ""BRUNT"" – T invalid\n- ""FRUIT"" – already used\n- ""CRUMP"" – already used\n\nIt appears the only remaining valid word is ""DRUID"", but I is ruled out. This suggests we might have missed a word. \n\nWait, let\'s check ""DRUID"" again – I is ruled out. \n\nLooking back, we have D, R, U, and need two more letters from allowed set. \n\nPossible words:\n- ""DRUZY"" – Z is allowed, Y is allowed\n- ""DRUZY"" is a valid word meaning ""having small crystals""\n\nThis fits:\n- Pattern: D R U Z Y\n- Uses only allowed letters (D, R, U, Z, Y)\n- All letters are from the allowed set\n\nThus, ""DRUZY"" is the correct next guess.\n\n<guess>DRUZY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: FRUIT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) U(✓) I(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CRUMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 4: BRUIN -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(✓) I(x) N(x)\nGuess 5: DRUZY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) U(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the five guesses we now have:

1. Pattern: D R U _ Y  
   (positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are locked)

2. Letters known NOT in the word:
   A, O, S, E, F, I, T, C, M, P, B, N, Z

3. The only remaining letter to determine is the 4th position, and the only unused consonant that is allowed is “L”.

Therefore the missing letter must be L, forming the word “DRULY”.
