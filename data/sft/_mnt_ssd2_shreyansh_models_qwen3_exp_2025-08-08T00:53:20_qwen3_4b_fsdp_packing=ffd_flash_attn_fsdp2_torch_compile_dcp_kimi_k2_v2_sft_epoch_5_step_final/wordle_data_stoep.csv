For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters.

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most frequent letters in English. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" which also covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it includes O which is also very common.

So my first guess will be AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with …O_.
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know are in the word: O (position 3), S, E.
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. Contains both S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5 in AROSE, and they’re marked “wrong position”).
3. Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is already O), so E could be 1 or 2.

Let’s brainstorm:
- If S is in position 1: S _ O E _ or S _ O _ E
- If S is in position 2: _ S O E _ or _ S O _ E
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S with E in 1 or 2.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2 (CONES):
- C and N are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3).
Wait, this is impossible - in Guess 1, O was marked ✓ (correct position) at position 3, but in Guess 2, O is now marked (-) (wrong position). This is a contradiction in the feedback provided.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for Guess 2 shows:
- O(-) : This means the letter O is in the word but in the wrong position for Guess 2 (position 2). This does NOT contradict Guess 1, because Guess 1's O was in position 3 and marked ✓, indicating it was correct there. The O in Guess 2 is in position 2 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 2 - which is consistent with O being at position 3.

So corrected knowledge:
- O is in position 3 (fixed).
- S and E are in the word, but:
  - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  - E is not in position 5 (from AROSE).
  - From CONES: E is in position 4 (marked ✓), so E is in position 4.
  - S is in position 5 (marked (-) in CONES, meaning not in position 5 - so S must be in position 1 or 2).
  - Also, C and N are not in the word.

So far we have:

- Must contain S (not in 4 or 5, so S must be in 1 or 2).

Possible words:
- S _ O E _ : S(1), _(?), O(3), E(4), _(?)
- _ S O E _ : _(?), S(2), O(3), E(4), _(?)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- SPOKE: contains P and K, but K is not in word (no info), P not tested. Also E is in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SHOVE: contains H and V, but V not tested. Also E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SLATE: contains L and T, but T not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- STOLE: contains T and L, but T and L not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SWORE: contains W and R, but R is invalid (from AROSE).

- SLOPE: contains L and P, but P not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SPOOF: lacks E - invalid.
- SWEET: lacks S in 1 - invalid (E in 4, but S in 2).

Best candidate seems SPOKE, but let's check if any letters are invalid:
- S, P, O, K, E: none are A, R, C, N.
- K is new, but no info against it.

Alternative: SLATE - L and T are new, but valid.
Another: STOLE - T and L are new, but valid.

Between SPOKE, SLATE, STOLE, SLOPE, SMOKE, SHOVE, the most common letters with no conflicts are SPOKE or SLATE.

Let's choose SPOKE as it introduces P and K which are common.

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Letters A, R, C, N are not in the word.

A good next guess is SPOKE, which places S in position 1, tests P and K, and fits the known pattern _ _ O E _.

<guess>SPOKE</guess>",SPOKE,"Let's consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2 (CONES):
- C and N are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3).
Wait, this is impossible - in Guess 1, O was marked ✓ (correct position) at position 3, but in Guess 2, O is now marked (-) (wrong position). This is a contradiction in the feedback provided.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for Guess 2 shows:
- O(-) : This means the letter O is in the word but in the wrong position for Guess 2 (position 2). This does NOT contradict Guess 1, because Guess 1's O was in position 3 and marked ✓, indicating it was correct there. The O in Guess 2 is in position 2 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 2 - which is consistent with O being at position 3.

So corrected knowledge:
- O is in position 3 (fixed).
- S and E are in the word, but:
  - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  - E is not in position 5 (from AROSE).
  - From CONES: E is in position 4 (marked ✓), so E is in position 4.
  - S is in position 5 (marked (-) in CONES, meaning not in position 5 - so S must be in position 1 or 2).
  - Also, C and N are not in the word.

So far we have:
- _ _ O E _
- Must contain S (not in 4 or 5, so S must be in 1 or 2).
- No A, R, C, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters.

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most frequent letters in English. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" which also covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it includes O which is also very common.

So my first guess will be AROSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with …O_.
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know are in the word: O (position 3), S, E.
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. Contains both S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5 in AROSE, and they’re marked “wrong position”).
3. Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is already O), so E could be 1 or 2.

Let’s brainstorm:
- If S is in position 1: S _ O E _ or S _ O _ E
- If S is in position 2: _ S O E _ or _ S O _ E
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S with E in 1 or 2.

Looking for valid words:
- SPOKE: S(1), P(?), O(3), K(?), E(5) – but E is in 5 (same as AROSE), and feedback said E is wrong position. So E can’t be 5. Eliminate.
- SLOPE: S(1), L(?), O(3), P(?), E(5) – again E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SMOKE: same issue with E in 5. Eliminate.
- SPORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SHOVE: contains H and V (unknown yet), but E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SWEET: E in 5 invalid, plus double E. Eliminate.
- STOLE: S(1), T(?), O(3), L(?), E(5) – E in 5 invalid. Eliminate.
- STORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SLOBS: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SNOES: double E and double S issues. Eliminate.
- SPOOF: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SWEAT: lacks E in valid position. Eliminate.

Alternative approach: E in position 1 or 2.
- E _ O S _ : E(1), _(?), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: ELOPS? Not valid.
- E S O _ _: E(1), S(2), O(3), _(?), _(?). Possible word: ESOP_ – no common word.
- _ E O S _: _(?), E(2), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: LEONS? No.
- _ E O _ S: _(?), E(2), O(3), _(?), S(5). Possible word: BEONS? Not valid.
- _ _ O E S: _(?), _(?), O(3), E(4), S(5). Possible word: CONES – but N and C are new, no A or R. Valid word! Let’s check:
  - CONES: C(?), O(3), N(?), E(4), S(5).
  - Contains O in 3 (✓), S in 5 (new position), E in 4 (new position), and no A or R.
  - All letters C, O, N, E, S are valid and no duplicates.
  - Seems like a strong second guess.

Known positions:

- Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- S (✓ in position 1 from SPOKE)
- O (already placed at 3)
- E (already placed at 4)

Known letters NOT in the word (x in any guess):
A, R, C, N, K

Forbidden positions for remaining letters:
- S is already fixed at position 1 → no need to test elsewhere.
- E is fixed at position 4 → no need to test elsewhere.
- O is fixed at position 3 → no need to test elsewhere.
- P was tested in position 2 (SPOKE) and marked (-) → P is in the word but NOT at position 2.
- Therefore P must be at position 5.

So far we have:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SLOEP – not a valid English word.
- SMOTE – contains M and T (both still allowed). “SMOTE” is a valid variant of “smote” (past tense of smite).
- SHOEP – not a word.
- STOEP – not a word.
- SWOEP – not a word.
- SPOEP – not a word.
- SGOEP – not a word.
- SMOKE – already tested (K is invalid).
- SLOPE – already considered (P at 5, but L at 2). “SLOPE” is a valid word.

Let’s verify SLOPE:
- S (1) ✓, L (2), O (3) ✓, P (5), E (4) ✓
- Letters used: S, L, O, P, E – none are forbidden except P was marked (-) but is now in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Hence SLOPE is a valid candidate.

- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SLOEP – not a valid English word.
- SMOTE – contains M and T (both still allowed). “SMOTE” is a valid variant of “smote” (past tense of smite).
- SHOEP – not a word.
- STOEP – not a word.
- SWOEP – not a word.
- SPOEP – not a word.
- SGOEP – not a word.
- SMOKE – already tested (K is invalid).
- SLOPE – already considered (P at 5, but L at 2). “SLOPE” is a valid word.

Let’s verify SLOPE:
- S (1) ✓, L (2), O (3) ✓, P (5), E (4) ✓
- Letters used: S, L, O, P, E – none are forbidden except P was marked (-) but is now in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Hence SLOPE is a valid candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters.

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most frequent letters in English. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" which also covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it includes O which is also very common.

So my first guess will be AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with …O_.
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know are in the word: O (position 3), S, E.
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. Contains both S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5 in AROSE, and they’re marked “wrong position”).
3. Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is already O), so E could be 1 or 2.

Let’s brainstorm:
- If S is in position 1: S _ O E _ or S _ O _ E
- If S is in position 2: _ S O E _ or _ S O _ E
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S with E in 1 or 2.

Looking for valid words:
- SPOKE: S(1), P(?), O(3), K(?), E(5) – but E is in 5 (same as AROSE), and feedback said E is wrong position. So E can’t be 5. Eliminate.
- SLOPE: S(1), L(?), O(3), P(?), E(5) – again E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SMOKE: same issue with E in 5. Eliminate.
- SPORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SHOVE: contains H and V (unknown yet), but E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SWEET: E in 5 invalid, plus double E. Eliminate.
- STOLE: S(1), T(?), O(3), L(?), E(5) – E in 5 invalid. Eliminate.
- STORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SLOBS: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SNOES: double E and double S issues. Eliminate.
- SPOOF: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SWEAT: lacks E in valid position. Eliminate.

Alternative approach: E in position 1 or 2.
- E _ O S _ : E(1), _(?), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: ELOPS? Not valid.
- E S O _ _: E(1), S(2), O(3), _(?), _(?). Possible word: ESOP_ – no common word.
- _ E O S _: _(?), E(2), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: LEONS? No.
- _ E O _ S: _(?), E(2), O(3), _(?), S(5). Possible word: BEONS? Not valid.
- _ _ O E S: _(?), _(?), O(3), E(4), S(5). Possible word: CONES – but N and C are new, no A or R. Valid word! Let’s check:
  - CONES: C(?), O(3), N(?), E(4), S(5).
  - Contains O in 3 (✓), S in 5 (new position), E in 4 (new position), and no A or R.
  - All letters C, O, N, E, S are valid and no duplicates.
  - Seems like a strong second guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2 (CONES):
- C and N are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3).
Wait, this is impossible - in Guess 1, O was marked ✓ (correct position) at position 3, but in Guess 2, O is now marked (-) (wrong position). This is a contradiction in the feedback provided.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for Guess 2 shows:
- O(-) : This means the letter O is in the word but in the wrong position for Guess 2 (position 2). This does NOT contradict Guess 1, because Guess 1's O was in position 3 and marked ✓, indicating it was correct there. The O in Guess 2 is in position 2 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 2 - which is consistent with O being at position 3.

So corrected knowledge:
- O is in position 3 (fixed).
- S and E are in the word, but:
  - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  - E is not in position 5 (from AROSE).
  - From CONES: E is in position 4 (marked ✓), so E is in position 4.
  - S is in position 5 (marked (-) in CONES, meaning not in position 5 - so S must be in position 1 or 2).
  - Also, C and N are not in the word.

So far we have:
- _ _ O E _
- Must contain S (not in 4 or 5, so S must be in 1 or 2).
- No A, R, C, N.

Possible words:
- S _ O E _ : S(1), _(?), O(3), E(4), _(?)
- _ S O E _ : _(?), S(2), O(3), E(4), _(?)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- SPOKE: contains P and K, but K is not in word (no info), P not tested. Also E is in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SHOVE: contains H and V, but V not tested. Also E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SLATE: contains L and T, but T not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- STOLE: contains T and L, but T and L not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SWORE: contains W and R, but R is invalid (from AROSE).
- SMOKE: contains M and K, but K not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SLOPE: contains L and P, but P not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SPOOF: lacks E - invalid.
- SWEET: lacks S in 1 - invalid (E in 4, but S in 2).

Best candidate seems SPOKE, but let's check if any letters are invalid:
- S, P, O, K, E: none are A, R, C, N.
- K is new, but no info against it.

Alternative: SLATE - L and T are new, but valid.
Another: STOLE - T and L are new, but valid.

Between SPOKE, SLATE, STOLE, SLOPE, SMOKE, SHOVE, the most common letters with no conflicts are SPOKE or SLATE.

Let's choose SPOKE as it introduces P and K which are common.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Letters A, R, C, N are not in the word.

A good next guess is SPOKE, which places S in position 1, tests P and K, and fits the known pattern _ _ O E _.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Known positions:
- Position 3 = O (✓ from AROSE and confirmed by SPOKE)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- S (✓ in position 1 from SPOKE)
- O (already placed at 3)
- E (already placed at 4)

Known letters NOT in the word (x in any guess):
A, R, C, N, K

Forbidden positions for remaining letters:
- S is already fixed at position 1 → no need to test elsewhere.
- E is fixed at position 4 → no need to test elsewhere.
- O is fixed at position 3 → no need to test elsewhere.
- P was tested in position 2 (SPOKE) and marked (-) → P is in the word but NOT at position 2.
- Therefore P must be at position 5.

So far we have:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SLOEP – not a valid English word.
- SMOTE – contains M and T (both still allowed). “SMOTE” is a valid variant of “smote” (past tense of smite).
- SHOEP – not a word.
- STOEP – not a word.
- SWOEP – not a word.
- SPOEP – not a word.
- SGOEP – not a word.
- SMOKE – already tested (K is invalid).
- SLOPE – already considered (P at 5, but L at 2). “SLOPE” is a valid word.

Let’s verify SLOPE:
- S (1) ✓, L (2), O (3) ✓, P (5), E (4) ✓
- Letters used: S, L, O, P, E – none are forbidden except P was marked (-) but is now in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Hence SLOPE is a valid candidate.

Let’s list everything we now know.

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1 = S (✓ from SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 3 = O (✓ from AROSE, confirmed by SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

2. Letters that must appear somewhere:
   - S, O, E (already placed)
   - P (must appear, because it was marked “-” in SPOKE, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any guess):
   A, R, C, N, K, L

4. Forbidden positions for P:
   - P cannot be in position 2 (from SPOKE)
   - P cannot be in position 5 (from SLOPE)
   Therefore P must be in position 5.

So the pattern is:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, L, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SBOEP – invalid
- SDOEP – invalid
- SFOEP – invalid
- SGOEP – invalid
- SHOEP – invalid
- SMOEP – invalid
- STOEP – invalid
- SWOEP – invalid
- SYOEP – invalid

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me double-check the dictionary for real words matching S?OEP.

The only valid English word that fits S _ O E P is “SPOEP,” but P is already known to be in the word and we’ve placed it at position 5.  
Since P must be at position 5, the only possible word is S _ O E P with P at 5, but that would require the word to be S _ O E P, which is not a valid word.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully.  
In SLOPE, P was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
We thought that meant P cannot be at 5, but actually the feedback for SLOPE was:

S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)

This means:
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (which is already E, so this is irrelevant)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)

So P could still be in positions 2 or 5, but:
- In SPOKE, P was in position 2 and marked “-”, so P is not in position 2
- Therefore P must be in position 5

So the word must be S _ O E P

But there is no standard 5-letter English word of the form S?OEP.

This suggests we might have made an error in assuming P must be in the word.  
Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

In SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  
In SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)

Thus P must be in position 5.

But the only possible word is S _ O E P, which does not exist.

This implies our assumption that P must be in the word is correct, but there is no valid word matching this pattern.  
Therefore the only possible resolution is that the word is “SPOEP,” but that is not a valid English word.

Wait, let me check again: is there any valid 5-letter word S _ O E P?

Searching the dictionary, the only valid word is “SPOEP,” which is not recognized.  
Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “SMOTE,” but let me check:

SMOTE:
- S(1) ✓
- M(?)
- O(3) ✓
- T(?)
- E(4) ✓

This fits all constraints:
- S, O, E are in correct positions
- M and T are new letters not yet tested
- No forbidden letters (A, R, C, N, K, L)
- P is not required here, which resolves the earlier contradiction because the feedback for SPOKE and SLOPE only indicated P was in the word but not in specific positions, but did not guarantee P must be present.  
However, the feedback for SPOKE specifically stated P(-), which means P is in the word but not in position 2.  
Thus P must be in the word somewhere.

Given that, and the pattern S _ O E P, the only possible word is “SPOEP,” which is invalid.  
This suggests the word must be “SMOTE,” but that does not contain P, which contradicts the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback:  
The feedback for SPOKE was S(✓) P(-) O(✓) K(x) E(-)  
The feedback for SLOPE was S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)

The “P(-)” in both instances means P is in the word but not in the position shown.  
In SPOKE, P was in position 2 → not position 2  
In SLOPE, P was in position 4 → not position 4 (but position 4 is E, so this is irrelevant)

Thus P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
But:
- Position 1 is S
- Position 3 is O
- Position 5 is P (only remaining spot)

Thus the word must be S _ O E P, but this is not a valid English word.

This indicates the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is “SMOTE,” which does not contain P, suggesting the feedback interpretation might have been off.  
However, strictly following the feedback, P must be in the word.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct interpretation is that the feedback symbols apply to the specific guess.  
The feedback for SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  
The feedback for SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)

Thus P must be in position 5, making the word S _ O E P, which does not exist.  
This implies the word must be “SMOTE,” and the feedback for SPOKE’s P(-) might have been intended to mean P is in the word but not in position 2, and similarly for SLOPE, but since position 4 is E, P must be elsewhere.

Given the constraints, the only valid word is “SMOTE,” and we must test it.

<guess>SMOTE</guess>",SMOTE,"Let’s list everything we now know.

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1 = S (✓ from SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 3 = O (✓ from AROSE, confirmed by SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

2. Letters that must appear somewhere:
   - S, O, E (already placed)
   - P (must appear, because it was marked “-” in SPOKE, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any guess):
   A, R, C, N, K, L

4. Forbidden positions for P:
   - P cannot be in position 2 (from SPOKE)
   - P cannot be in position 5 (from SLOPE)
   Therefore P must be in position 5.

So the pattern is:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, L, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SBOEP – invalid
- SDOEP – invalid
- SFOEP – invalid
- SGOEP – invalid
- SHOEP – invalid
- SMOEP – invalid
- STOEP – invalid
- SWOEP – invalid
- SYOEP – invalid

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me double-check the dictionary for real words matching S?OEP.

The only valid English word that fits S _ O E P is “SPOEP,” but P is already known to be in the word and we’ve placed it at position 5.  
Since P must be at position 5, the only possible word is S _ O E P with P at 5, but that would require the word to be S _ O E P, which is not a valid word.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully.  
In SLOPE, P was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
We thought that meant P cannot be at 5, but actually the feedback for SLOPE was:

S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)

This means:
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (which is already E, so this is irrelevant)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)

So P could still be in positions 2 or 5, but:
- In SPOKE, P was in position 2 and marked “-”, so P is not in position 2
- Therefore P must be in position 5

So the word must be S _ O E P

But there is no standard 5-letter English word of the form S?OEP.

This suggests we might have made an error in assuming P must be in the word.  
Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

In SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  
In SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)

Thus P must be in position 5.

But the only possible word is S _ O E P, which does not exist.

This implies our assumption that P must be in the word is correct, but there is no valid word matching this pattern.  
Therefore the only possible resolution is that the word is “SPOEP,” but that is not a valid English word.

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “SMOTE,” but let me check:

SMOTE:

This fits all constraints:
- S, O, E are in correct positions

In SPOKE, P was in position 2 → not position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible while avoiding duplicates to test more unique letters.

Looking at these common letters, a strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most frequent letters in English. This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" which also covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with AROSE as it includes O which is also very common.

So my first guess will be AROSE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with …O_.
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Letters we now know are in the word: O (position 3), S, E.
Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position ( _ _ O _ _ ).
2. Contains both S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively (since S was in position 4 and E in position 5 in AROSE, and they’re marked “wrong position”).
3. Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- E could be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is already O), so E could be 1 or 2.

Let’s brainstorm:
- If S is in position 1: S _ O E _ or S _ O _ E
- If S is in position 2: _ S O E _ or _ S O _ E
- If S is in position 5: _ _ O _ S with E in 1 or 2.

Looking for valid words:
- SPOKE: S(1), P(?), O(3), K(?), E(5) – but E is in 5 (same as AROSE), and feedback said E is wrong position. So E can’t be 5. Eliminate.
- SLOPE: S(1), L(?), O(3), P(?), E(5) – again E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SMOKE: same issue with E in 5. Eliminate.
- SPORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SHOVE: contains H and V (unknown yet), but E in 5 is invalid. Eliminate.
- SWEET: E in 5 invalid, plus double E. Eliminate.
- STOLE: S(1), T(?), O(3), L(?), E(5) – E in 5 invalid. Eliminate.
- STORE: contains R (invalid). Eliminate.
- SLOBS: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SNOES: double E and double S issues. Eliminate.
- SPOOF: lacks E. Eliminate.
- SWEAT: lacks E in valid position. Eliminate.

Alternative approach: E in position 1 or 2.
- E _ O S _ : E(1), _(?), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: ELOPS? Not valid.
- E S O _ _: E(1), S(2), O(3), _(?), _(?). Possible word: ESOP_ – no common word.
- _ E O S _: _(?), E(2), O(3), S(4), _(?). Possible word: LEONS? No.
- _ E O _ S: _(?), E(2), O(3), _(?), S(5). Possible word: BEONS? Not valid.
- _ _ O E S: _(?), _(?), O(3), E(4), S(5). Possible word: CONES – but N and C are new, no A or R. Valid word! Let’s check:
  - CONES: C(?), O(3), N(?), E(4), S(5).
  - Contains O in 3 (✓), S in 5 (new position), E in 4 (new position), and no A or R.
  - All letters C, O, N, E, S are valid and no duplicates.
  - Seems like a strong second guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, R are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- S and E are in the word but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

From Guess 2 (CONES):
- C and N are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3).
Wait, this is impossible - in Guess 1, O was marked ✓ (correct position) at position 3, but in Guess 2, O is now marked (-) (wrong position). This is a contradiction in the feedback provided.

However, upon closer inspection, the feedback for Guess 2 shows:
- O(-) : This means the letter O is in the word but in the wrong position for Guess 2 (position 2). This does NOT contradict Guess 1, because Guess 1's O was in position 3 and marked ✓, indicating it was correct there. The O in Guess 2 is in position 2 and marked (-), meaning it's in the word but not at position 2 - which is consistent with O being at position 3.

So corrected knowledge:
- O is in position 3 (fixed).
- S and E are in the word, but:
  - S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).
  - E is not in position 5 (from AROSE).
  - From CONES: E is in position 4 (marked ✓), so E is in position 4.
  - S is in position 5 (marked (-) in CONES, meaning not in position 5 - so S must be in position 1 or 2).
  - Also, C and N are not in the word.

So far we have:
- _ _ O E _
- Must contain S (not in 4 or 5, so S must be in 1 or 2).
- No A, R, C, N.

Possible words:
- S _ O E _ : S(1), _(?), O(3), E(4), _(?)
- _ S O E _ : _(?), S(2), O(3), E(4), _(?)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- SPOKE: contains P and K, but K is not in word (no info), P not tested. Also E is in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SHOVE: contains H and V, but V not tested. Also E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SLATE: contains L and T, but T not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- STOLE: contains T and L, but T and L not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SWORE: contains W and R, but R is invalid (from AROSE).
- SMOKE: contains M and K, but K not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SLOPE: contains L and P, but P not tested. E in 4, S in 1 - possible.
- SPOOF: lacks E - invalid.
- SWEET: lacks S in 1 - invalid (E in 4, but S in 2).

Best candidate seems SPOKE, but let's check if any letters are invalid:
- S, P, O, K, E: none are A, R, C, N.
- K is new, but no info against it.

Alternative: SLATE - L and T are new, but valid.
Another: STOLE - T and L are new, but valid.

Between SPOKE, SLATE, STOLE, SLOPE, SMOKE, SHOVE, the most common letters with no conflicts are SPOKE or SLATE.

Let's choose SPOKE as it introduces P and K which are common.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 3.
- E is confirmed in position 4.
- S must be in position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5).
- Letters A, R, C, N are not in the word.

A good next guess is SPOKE, which places S in position 1, tests P and K, and fits the known pattern _ _ O E _.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Known positions:
- Position 3 = O (✓ from AROSE and confirmed by SPOKE)
- Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

Known letters (must appear somewhere):
- S (✓ in position 1 from SPOKE)
- O (already placed at 3)
- E (already placed at 4)

Known letters NOT in the word (x in any guess):
A, R, C, N, K

Forbidden positions for remaining letters:
- S is already fixed at position 1 → no need to test elsewhere.
- E is fixed at position 4 → no need to test elsewhere.
- O is fixed at position 3 → no need to test elsewhere.
- P was tested in position 2 (SPOKE) and marked (-) → P is in the word but NOT at position 2.
- Therefore P must be at position 5.

So far we have:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SLOEP – not a valid English word.
- SMOTE – contains M and T (both still allowed). “SMOTE” is a valid variant of “smote” (past tense of smite).
- SHOEP – not a word.
- STOEP – not a word.
- SWOEP – not a word.
- SPOEP – not a word.
- SGOEP – not a word.
- SMOKE – already tested (K is invalid).
- SLOPE – already considered (P at 5, but L at 2). “SLOPE” is a valid word.

Let’s verify SLOPE:
- S (1) ✓, L (2), O (3) ✓, P (5), E (4) ✓
- Letters used: S, L, O, P, E – none are forbidden except P was marked (-) but is now in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

Hence SLOPE is a valid candidate.

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1 = S (✓ from SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 3 = O (✓ from AROSE, confirmed by SPOKE and SLOPE)
   - Position 4 = E (✓ from CONES)

2. Letters that must appear somewhere:
   - S, O, E (already placed)
   - P (must appear, because it was marked “-” in SPOKE, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any guess):
   A, R, C, N, K, L

4. Forbidden positions for P:
   - P cannot be in position 2 (from SPOKE)
   - P cannot be in position 5 (from SLOPE)
   Therefore P must be in position 5.

So the pattern is:
S _ O E P

Only position 2 is unknown.  
We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, L, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, T, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SBOEP – invalid
- SDOEP – invalid
- SFOEP – invalid
- SGOEP – invalid
- SHOEP – invalid
- SMOEP – invalid
- STOEP – invalid
- SWOEP – invalid
- SYOEP – invalid

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me double-check the dictionary for real words matching S?OEP.

The only valid English word that fits S _ O E P is “SPOEP,” but P is already known to be in the word and we’ve placed it at position 5.  
Since P must be at position 5, the only possible word is S _ O E P with P at 5, but that would require the word to be S _ O E P, which is not a valid word.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully.  
In SLOPE, P was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
We thought that meant P cannot be at 5, but actually the feedback for SLOPE was:

S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)

This means:
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (which is already E, so this is irrelevant)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)

So P could still be in positions 2 or 5, but:
- In SPOKE, P was in position 2 and marked “-”, so P is not in position 2
- Therefore P must be in position 5

So the word must be S _ O E P

But there is no standard 5-letter English word of the form S?OEP.

This suggests we might have made an error in assuming P must be in the word.  
Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

In SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  
In SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)

Thus P must be in position 5.

But the only possible word is S _ O E P, which does not exist.

This implies our assumption that P must be in the word is correct, but there is no valid word matching this pattern.  
Therefore the only possible resolution is that the word is “SPOEP,” but that is not a valid English word.

Wait, let me check again: is there any valid 5-letter word S _ O E P?

Searching the dictionary, the only valid word is “SPOEP,” which is not recognized.  
Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “SMOTE,” but let me check:

SMOTE:
- S(1) ✓
- M(?)
- O(3) ✓
- T(?)
- E(4) ✓

This fits all constraints:
- S, O, E are in correct positions
- M and T are new letters not yet tested
- No forbidden letters (A, R, C, N, K, L)
- P is not required here, which resolves the earlier contradiction because the feedback for SPOKE and SLOPE only indicated P was in the word but not in specific positions, but did not guarantee P must be present.  
However, the feedback for SPOKE specifically stated P(-), which means P is in the word but not in position 2.  
Thus P must be in the word somewhere.

Given that, and the pattern S _ O E P, the only possible word is “SPOEP,” which is invalid.  
This suggests the word must be “SMOTE,” but that does not contain P, which contradicts the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback:  
The feedback for SPOKE was S(✓) P(-) O(✓) K(x) E(-)  
The feedback for SLOPE was S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)

The “P(-)” in both instances means P is in the word but not in the position shown.  
In SPOKE, P was in position 2 → not position 2  
In SLOPE, P was in position 4 → not position 4 (but position 4 is E, so this is irrelevant)

Thus P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
But:
- Position 1 is S
- Position 3 is O
- Position 5 is P (only remaining spot)

Thus the word must be S _ O E P, but this is not a valid English word.

This indicates the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is “SMOTE,” which does not contain P, suggesting the feedback interpretation might have been off.  
However, strictly following the feedback, P must be in the word.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct interpretation is that the feedback symbols apply to the specific guess.  
The feedback for SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  
The feedback for SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)

Thus P must be in position 5, making the word S _ O E P, which does not exist.  
This implies the word must be “SMOTE,” and the feedback for SPOKE’s P(-) might have been intended to mean P is in the word but not in position 2, and similarly for SLOPE, but since position 4 is E, P must be elsewhere.

Given the constraints, the only valid word is “SMOTE,” and we must test it.

This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\nAnother excellent choice would be ""SLATE"" which also covers S, L, A, T, E - but I\'ll go with AROSE as it includes O which is also very common.\n\nSo my first guess will be AROSE.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A and R are NOT in the word (x).\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends with …O_.\n- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).\n\nLetters we now know are in the word: O (position 3), S, E.\nLetters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

– invalid\n\nHmm, none of these are valid.  \nLet me double-check the dictionary for real words matching S?OEP.\n\nThe only valid English word that fits S _ O E P is “SPOEP,” but P is already known to be in the word and we’ve placed it at position 5.  \nSince P must be at position 5, the only possible word is S _ O E P with P at 5, but that would require the word to be S _ O E P, which is not a valid word.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully.  \nIn SLOPE, P was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position).  \nWe thought that meant P cannot be at 5, but actually the feedback for SLOPE was:\n\nS(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)\n\nThis means:\n- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (which is already E, so this is irrelevant)\n- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (already known)\n\nSo P could still be in positions 2 or 5, but:\n- In SPOKE, P was in position 2 and marked “-”, so P is not in position 2\n- Therefore P must be in position 5\n\nSo the word must be S _ O E P\n\nBut there is no standard 5-letter English word of the form S?OEP.\n\nThis suggests we might have made an error in assuming P must be in the word.  \nLet me re-read the feedback carefully:\n\nIn SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  \nIn SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)\n\nThus P must be in position 5.\n\nBut the only possible word is S _ O E P, which does not exist.\n\nThis implies our assumption that P must be in the word is correct, but there is no valid word matching this pattern.  \nTherefore the only possible resolution is that the word is “SPOEP,” but that is not a valid English word.\n\nWait, let me check again: is there any valid 5-letter word S _ O E P?\n\nSearching the dictionary, the only valid word is “SPOEP,” which is not recognized.  \nTherefore, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “SMOTE,” but let me check:\n\nSMOTE:\n- S(1) ✓\n- M(?)\n- O(3) ✓\n- T(?)\n- E(4) ✓\n\nThis fits all constraints:\n- S, O, E are in correct positions\n- M and T are new letters not yet tested\n- No forbidden letters (A, R, C, N, K, L)\n- P is not required here, which resolves the earlier contradiction because the feedback for SPOKE and SLOPE only indicated P was in the word but not in specific positions, but did not guarantee P must be present.  \nHowever, the feedback for SPOKE specifically stated P(-), which means P is in the word but not in position 2.  \nThus P must be in the word somewhere.\n\nGiven that, and the pattern S _ O E P, the only possible word is “SPOEP,” which is invalid.  \nThis suggests the word must be “SMOTE,” but that does not contain P, which contradicts the feedback.\n\nRe-examining the feedback:  \nThe feedback for SPOKE was S(✓) P(-) O(✓) K(x) E(-)  \nThe feedback for SLOPE was S(✓) L(x) O(✓) P(-) E(-)\n\nThe “P(-)” in both instances means P is in the word but not in the position shown.  \nIn SPOKE, P was in position 2 → not position 2  \nIn SLOPE, P was in position 4 → not position 4 (but position 4 is E, so this is irrelevant)\n\nThus P must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  \nBut:\n- Position 1 is S\n- Position 3 is O\n- Position 5 is P (only remaining spot)\n\nThus the word must be S _ O E P, but this is not a valid English word.\n\nThis indicates the only possible valid word fitting all constraints is “SMOTE,” which does not contain P, suggesting the feedback interpretation might have been off.  \nHowever, strictly following the feedback, P must be in the word.\n\nUpon deeper reflection, the correct interpretation is that the feedback symbols apply to the specific guess.  \nThe feedback for SPOKE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 2  \nThe feedback for SLOPE: P(-) means P is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E, so this is redundant)\n\nThus P must be in position 5, making the word S _ O E P, which does not exist.  \nThis implies the word must be “SMOTE,” and the feedback for SPOKE’s P(-) might have been intended to mean P is in the word but not in position 2, and similarly for SLOPE, but since position 4 is E, P must be elsewhere.\n\nGiven the constraints,

   - Position 3 = O (✓ in AROSE, SPOKE, SLOPE, SMOTE)
   - Position 4 = E (✓ in CONES, SLOPE, SMOTE)

2. Letters that must appear:

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (x in any guess):

4. Forbidden positions for P:
   - P cannot be in position 2 (from SPOKE)
   - P cannot be in position 5 (from SMOTE)
   - P cannot be in position 4 (already E)
   Therefore P must be in position 5.

We need a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not A, R, C, N, K, L, M, S, O, E, P)
- Makes a valid 5-letter word with S _ O E P

So T must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be S T O E P, but that is not a valid word.

2: ?
3: O
4: E
5: P

The only valid English word fitting S _ O E P is “SPOEP,” which does not exist.  
This indicates the word must be “STOEP,” but that is also invalid.

Upon careful re-examination, the only valid word is “STOEP,” but it is not recognized.  
This implies the word is “STOKE,” but K is invalid.  
Next candidate: “STOPE” – P is in position 5, which satisfies all constraints.

Check “STOPE”:
- S(1) ✓
- T(2) – T was marked “-” in SMOTE (meaning T is in word but not in position 5, so position 2 is allowed)

Therefore, the correct guess is STOPE.
