### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- SLATE
- CRANE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Let's try ""SHINE"":

But let's think more carefully - the pattern must be N O _ E S or _ O N E S. For _ O N E S, the first letter would be the only remaining one. Let's try ""CONES"" - but C hasn't been used, and it fits _ O N E S.

But wait, does _ O N E S make sense? That would be C O N E S, but that's 5 letters. Actually, _ O N E S would require the first letter to be whatever fits, but we have N in position 3 already.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ E S with N somewhere. Since N can't be in 3, it must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is invalid, so 1. So it's N O _ E S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- SLATE
- CRANE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, or T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4)
- Avoids L, A, T
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let's try ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S isn't in position 1 from SLATE feedback) - so this is invalid.

Try ""SPREE"":
- S in position 1 - invalid.

Try ""SENOR"":
- S in position 1 - invalid.

Try ""REINS"":
- S in position 5 - allowed (E is in position 2, S can be in 5)
- R, E, I, N are new letters to test
- Doesn't contain L, A, T

This seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REINS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) I(x) N(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- S (must be in position 5, because in SLATE it was “-” [wrong position] but in REINS it was “✓” [correct position 5])
- E (must be somewhere except positions 2 and 5)
- N (somewhere except position 4)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
- L, A, T, R, I

So the pattern so far:
- _ _ _ _ S
- E appears once in positions 1, 3, or 4
- N appears once in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S, so 1, 2, or 3)

We need three more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y. Remaining vowels: O, U.

Let’s try to place E and N together in the first three slots while introducing new, high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:
- N E _ _ S → need two new letters in positions 3-4
- _ N E _ S → same
- _ E N _ S → same

A quick check gives “HENS” as too short, “MENSE” as invalid, “PENCE” as invalid.

Try “PENES” – but that repeats E and isn’t a valid word.

Try “GONES”:
- G, O, N, E, S
- Contains N, E, S
- All letters are new (G, O)
- Valid English word

Let’s use GONES.

So the word looks like: _ O _ E S, with an additional N somewhere.

The only remaining positions for N are 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are taken and 3 was ruled out by GONES, N must be in position 1).

Thus the pattern is: N O _ E S or _ O N E S.

We need one more letter for the remaining blank. The letters not yet ruled out and common enough are: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""HONES"":
- H, O, N, E, S
- H is new, fits the pattern _ O N E S
- All letters are valid so far

But wait, we already ruled out H? No, H hasn't been used yet. Let me check if H is allowed - yes, it's not in the absent list.

But let's think more carefully - the pattern must be N O _ E S or _ O N E S. For _ O N E S, the first letter would be the only remaining one. Let's try ""CONES"" - but C hasn't been used, and it fits _ O N E S.

But wait, does _ O N E S make sense? That would be C O N E S, but that's 5 letters. Actually, _ O N E S would require the first letter to be whatever fits, but we have N in position 3 already.

Let's try ""NOBES"" - but NOBES isn't a valid word. ""NOCES"" - no. ""NODES"" - yes, valid word. ""NODES"" fits perfectly.

Check letters:
- N: position 1 (✓)
- O: position 2 (✓)

- E: position 4 (✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Popular and effective starting words include:
- STARE
- AROSE
- RAISE
- SLATE
- CRANE

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word.
- A is not in the word.
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, or T.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5)
- Has E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4)
- Avoids L, A, T
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let's try ""SHINE"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S isn't in position 1 from SLATE feedback) - so this is invalid.

Try ""SPREE"":
- S in position 1 - invalid.

Try ""SENOR"":
- S in position 1 - invalid.

Try ""REINS"":
- S in position 5 - allowed (E is in position 2, S can be in 5)
- R, E, I, N are new letters to test
- Doesn't contain L, A, T

This seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REINS -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) I(x) N(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- S (must be in position 5, because in SLATE it was “-” [wrong position] but in REINS it was “✓” [correct position 5])
- E (must be somewhere except positions 2 and 5)
- N (somewhere except position 4)

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
- L, A, T, R, I

So the pattern so far:
- _ _ _ _ S
- E appears once in positions 1, 3, or 4
- N appears once in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S, so 1, 2, or 3)

We need three more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y. Remaining vowels: O, U.

Let’s try to place E and N together in the first three slots while introducing new, high-frequency letters.

Candidate words:
- N E _ _ S → need two new letters in positions 3-4
- _ N E _ S → same
- _ E N _ S → same

A quick check gives “HENS” as too short, “MENSE” as invalid, “PENCE” as invalid.

Try “PENES” – but that repeats E and isn’t a valid word.

Try “GONES”:
- G, O, N, E, S
- Contains N, E, S
- All letters are new (G, O)
- Valid English word

Let’s use GONES.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

Guess 3: GONES -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

Confirmed letters and positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ in REINS and GONES).
- E is in position 4 (✓ in GONES).
- O is in position 2 (✓ in GONES).

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from GONES feedback N(-)).

Known absent letters: L, A, T, R, I, G.

So the word looks like: _ O _ E S, with an additional N somewhere.

The only remaining positions for N are 1 or 3 (since 2,4,5 are taken and 3 was ruled out by GONES, N must be in position 1).

Thus the pattern is: N O _ E S or _ O N E S.

We need one more letter for the remaining blank. The letters not yet ruled out and common enough are: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""HONES"":
- H, O, N, E, S
- H is new, fits the pattern _ O N E S
- All letters are valid so far

But wait, we already ruled out H? No, H hasn't been used yet. Let me check if H is allowed - yes, it's not in the absent list.

But let's think more carefully - the pattern must be N O _ E S or _ O N E S. For _ O N E S, the first letter would be the only remaining one. Let's try ""CONES"" - but C hasn't been used, and it fits _ O N E S.

But wait, does _ O N E S make sense? That would be C O N E S, but that's 5 letters. Actually, _ O N E S would require the first letter to be whatever fits, but we have N in position 3 already.

Actually, the pattern is _ O _ E S with N somewhere. Since N can't be in 3, it must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is invalid, so 1. So it's N O _ E S.

Thus the word is N O _ E S. The missing letter is position 3. Possible letters: common ones not ruled out are B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try ""NOBES"" - but NOBES isn't a valid word. ""NOCES"" - no. ""NODES"" - yes, valid word. ""NODES"" fits perfectly.

Check letters:
- N: position 1 (✓)
- O: position 2 (✓)
- D: new letter
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (✓)

All constraints satisfied.
