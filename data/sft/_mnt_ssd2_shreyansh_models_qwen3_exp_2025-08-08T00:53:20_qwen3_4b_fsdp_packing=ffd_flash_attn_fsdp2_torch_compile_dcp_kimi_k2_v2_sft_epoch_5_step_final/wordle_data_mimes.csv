### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters that might be in the secret word, either in their correct positions or as misplaced letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, E, I  

Known constraints:
- S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN).

So the word contains S, E, I and two other letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know the positions of S, E, I are still open except for the forbidden spots above.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, I in new positions that haven’t been ruled out.
2. Introduce two fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate word: “SIEVE”  
- S is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- V and E are new letters; E is repeated but that’s okay since we already know E is in the word.

However, “SIEVE” uses E twice, which is acceptable but might waste a letter slot. A cleaner choice is “SICKS” but that repeats S. Instead, let’s use “SLEET”:
- S in 1, L and T are new, but T is already ruled out.  
Another option: “SPICE”:
- S, P, I, C, E: all new letters except S and E which we know are present.  
Positions: S1, P?, I?, C?, E5 (E cannot be 5). So E must be in 3 or 4.  
“SPICE” puts E in 5, which is forbidden.  

Next: “SLEEP”:
- S, L, E, E, P. Again E in 5 is bad.  

“SIEPS” – not a valid word.  

“SIPED”:
- S, I, P, E, D.  
Positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), P?, E4 (ok), D?.  
No ruled-out letters. Valid word.  

But let’s pick a more common word. “SPIKE”:
- S, P, I, K, E.  
Positions: S1 (ok), P?, I?, K?, E5 (forbidden). E in 5 is bad.  

“SICKO” – O is ruled out.  

“SIGHT” – T ruled out.  

“SIPSY” – Y is new, but double S.  

“SIFTH” – T ruled out.  

“SIFTE” – T ruled out.  

“SIEVE” – E twice, but valid.  

“SIEVE” seems the best among options, or “SIPES” (double S).  

A better choice: “SIEPS” invalid.  

Let’s use “SIEVE” as it introduces V and E again.  

Actually, let’s use “SIEVE” but note E appears twice.  

Another valid word: “SIEPS” – invalid.  

“SIEVE” is acceptable.  

But to avoid repeating E, let’s try “SICKS” – invalid (double S).  

“SICKY” – Y new, but valid.  

“SICKY” positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), C?, K?, Y?.  
Valid word, introduces C and K.  

Let’s choose “SICKY”.

Wait, let’s pick “SIEVE” because it keeps S, I, E together and introduces V.  

But “SIEVE” has E in 5, which is forbidden.  

So E must be in 3 or 4.  

Let’s use “SLEEP” – E in 4 (ok).  

“SLEEP” is valid, introduces L and P.  

Yes, “SLEEP” is good.  

Final choice: “SLEEP”.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters that might be in the secret word, either in their correct positions or as misplaced letters.

- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN).

So the word contains S, E, I and two other letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know the positions of S, E, I are still open except for the forbidden spots above.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, I in new positions that haven’t been ruled out.
2. Introduce two fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate word: “SIEVE”  
- S is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- V and E are new letters; E is repeated but that’s okay since we already know E is in the word.

However, “SIEVE” uses E twice, which is acceptable but might waste a letter slot. A cleaner choice is “SICKS” but that repeats S. Instead, let’s use “SLEET”:
- S in 1, L and T are new, but T is already ruled out.  
Another option: “SPICE”:
- S, P, I, C, E: all new letters except S and E which we know are present.  
Positions: S1, P?, I?, C?, E5 (E cannot be 5). So E must be in 3 or 4.  
“SPICE” puts E in 5, which is forbidden.  

Next: “SLEEP”:
- S, L, E, E, P. Again E in 5 is bad.  

“SIEPS” – not a valid word.  

“SIPED”:
- S, I, P, E, D.  
Positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), P?, E4 (ok), D?.  
No ruled-out letters. Valid word.  

But let’s pick a more common word. “SPIKE”:
- S, P, I, K, E.  
Positions: S1 (ok), P?, I?, K?, E5 (forbidden). E in 5 is bad.  

“SICKO” – O is ruled out.  

“SIGHT” – T ruled out.  

“SIPSY” – Y is new, but double S.  

“SIFTH” – T ruled out.  

“SIFTE” – T ruled out.  

“SIEVE” – E twice, but valid.  

“SIEVE” seems the best among options, or “SIPES” (double S).  

A better choice: “SIEPS” invalid.  

Let’s use “SIEVE” as it introduces V and E again.  

Actually, let’s use “SIEVE” but note E appears twice.  

Another valid word: “SIEPS” – invalid.  

“SIEVE” is acceptable.  

But to avoid repeating E, let’s try “SICKS” – invalid (double S).  

“SICKY” – Y new, but valid.  

“SICKY” positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), C?, K?, Y?.  
Valid word, introduces C and K.  

Let’s choose “SICKY”.

Wait, let’s pick “SIEVE” because it keeps S, I, E together and introduces V.  

But “SIEVE” has E in 5, which is forbidden.  

So E must be in 3 or 4.  

Let’s use “SLEEP” – E in 4 (ok).  

“SLEEP” is valid, introduces L and P.  

Yes, “SLEEP” is good.  

Final choice: “SLEEP”.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, I, and two more letters from the still-unused pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Specific positional information:

- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).  It is confirmed in position 4 (from SLEEP).  So E is fixed at position 4.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters that might be in the secret word, either in their correct positions or as misplaced letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E.
- Excludes A, R, O.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining letters and places S and E in new positions. A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 5 before).
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- No A, R, or O are used.

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, E, I  

Known constraints:
- S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN).

So the word contains S, E, I and two other letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know the positions of S, E, I are still open except for the forbidden spots above.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, I in new positions that haven’t been ruled out.
2. Introduce two fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate word: “SIEVE”  
- S is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- V and E are new letters; E is repeated but that’s okay since we already know E is in the word.

However, “SIEVE” uses E twice, which is acceptable but might waste a letter slot. A cleaner choice is “SICKS” but that repeats S. Instead, let’s use “SLEET”:
- S in 1, L and T are new, but T is already ruled out.  
Another option: “SPICE”:
- S, P, I, C, E: all new letters except S and E which we know are present.  
Positions: S1, P?, I?, C?, E5 (E cannot be 5). So E must be in 3 or 4.  
“SPICE” puts E in 5, which is forbidden.  

Next: “SLEEP”:
- S, L, E, E, P. Again E in 5 is bad.  

“SIEPS” – not a valid word.  

“SIPED”:
- S, I, P, E, D.  
Positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), P?, E4 (ok), D?.  
No ruled-out letters. Valid word.  

But let’s pick a more common word. “SPIKE”:
- S, P, I, K, E.  
Positions: S1 (ok), P?, I?, K?, E5 (forbidden). E in 5 is bad.  

“SICKO” – O is ruled out.  

“SIGHT” – T ruled out.  

“SIPSY” – Y is new, but double S.  

“SIFTH” – T ruled out.  

“SIFTE” – T ruled out.  

“SIEVE” – E twice, but valid.  

“SIEVE” seems the best among options, or “SIPES” (double S).  

A better choice: “SIEPS” invalid.  

Let’s use “SIEVE” as it introduces V and E again.  

Actually, let’s use “SIEVE” but note E appears twice.  

Another valid word: “SIEPS” – invalid.  

“SIEVE” is acceptable.  

But to avoid repeating E, let’s try “SICKS” – invalid (double S).  

“SICKY” – Y new, but valid.  

“SICKY” positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), C?, K?, Y?.  
Valid word, introduces C and K.  

Let’s choose “SICKY”.

Wait, let’s pick “SIEVE” because it keeps S, I, E together and introduces V.  

But “SIEVE” has E in 5, which is forbidden.  

So E must be in 3 or 4.  

Let’s use “SLEEP” – E in 4 (ok).  

“SLEEP” is valid, introduces L and P.  

Yes, “SLEEP” is good.  

Final choice: “SLEEP”.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, L, P  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, I, and two more letters from the still-unused pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Specific positional information:
- S is not in position 1 (from STEIN and SLEEP) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  So S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).  It is confirmed in position 4 (from SLEEP).  So E is fixed at position 4.
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN) and not in position 3 (from SLEEP).  So I must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are still open except for the above constraints.

We need two more distinct letters (not yet used) to fill the remaining three slots (since E is locked at 4).  We want common letters to maximize information.

Candidate word structure: _ _ _ E _

Possible placements:
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- The remaining two letters must come from the unused set.

Let’s try S in position 2 and I in position 1:
Word form: I S _ E _

Need two more letters.  Common unused letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, Y.

Let’s pick C and K to form ""ISKED"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""ISKEE"" – invalid (double E).

""ISKEW"" – invalid.

""ISKEB"" – invalid.

""ISKEF"" – invalid.

Alternative: S in position 3 and I in position 1:
Word form: I _ S E _

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""ICASE"" – invalid (A ruled out).

""IGOSE"" – O ruled out.

""IMISE"" – invalid.

""IVISE"" – invalid.

""INISE"" – N ruled out.

""ISKED"" – invalid.

""ISKEW"" – invalid.

Alternative: S in position 5 and I in position 1:
Word form: I _ _ E S

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""ICERS"" – valid word, uses C and R (R is already ruled out).

""IGELS"" – invalid.

""IMBES"" – invalid.

""IVENS"" – N ruled out.

""IZENS"" – Z and N ruled out.

Alternative: I in position 2 and S in position 3:
Word form: _ I S E _

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""CISSE"" – invalid.

""DISSE"" – invalid.

""GISSE"" – invalid.

""VISSE"" – invalid.

""MISSY"" – invalid.

""KISSE"" – invalid.

Alternative: I in position 5 and S in position 2:
Word form: _ S _ E I

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""CSEMI"" – invalid.

""DSKIE"" – invalid.

""FSKIE"" – invalid.

""GSKIE"" – invalid.

""HSKIE"" – invalid.

""VSIE"" – too short.

""WSKIE"" – invalid.

""YSKIE"" – invalid.

Alternative: I in position 5 and S in position 3:
Word form: _ _ S E I

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""COSSE"" – O ruled out.

""DISSE"" – invalid.

""GISSE"" – invalid.

""VISSE"" – invalid.

""MISSY"" – invalid.

""KISSE"" – invalid.

""HSIE"" – too short.

Let’s try ""CSEMI"" – invalid.

""DSKIE"" – invalid.

""FSKIE"" – invalid.

""GSKIE"" – invalid.

""HSKIE"" – invalid.

""VSIE"" – too short.

""WSKIE"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""ICASE"" – invalid.

""IGOSE"" – O ruled out.

""IMISE"" – invalid.

""IVISE"" – invalid.

""IZISE"" – invalid.

Alternative: I in position 2 and S in position 5:
Word form: _ I _ E S

Let’s try ""CIGES"" – invalid.

""DIRKS"" – invalid.

""DISKS"" – S already used.

""DIVES"" – V and D unused, valid word.

""DIVES"" has D, I, V, E, S.  D and V are new, I in 2, S in 5, E in 4.  This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 – it’s in 5.  OK.
- E in 4 – confirmed.  OK.
- I not in 3 or 4 – it’s in 2.  OK.
- No A, R, O, T, N, L, P.  A, R, O, T, N, L, P are all excluded.  D and V are new.  The word ""DIVES"" is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DIVES"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify multiple letters that might be in the secret word, either in their correct positions or as misplaced letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E.
- Excludes A, R, O.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining letters and places S and E in new positions. A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 5 before).
- T, I, N are common letters not yet tested.
- No A, R, or O are used.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, E, I  

Known constraints:
- S is not in position 1 (from STEIN) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).
- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN).

So the word contains S, E, I and two other letters chosen from the remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know the positions of S, E, I are still open except for the forbidden spots above.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S, E, I in new positions that haven’t been ruled out.
2. Introduce two fresh, common consonants to maximize information.

Candidate word: “SIEVE”  
- S is in position 1 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- V and E are new letters; E is repeated but that’s okay since we already know E is in the word.

However, “SIEVE” uses E twice, which is acceptable but might waste a letter slot. A cleaner choice is “SICKS” but that repeats S. Instead, let’s use “SLEET”:
- S in 1, L and T are new, but T is already ruled out.  
Another option: “SPICE”:
- S, P, I, C, E: all new letters except S and E which we know are present.  
Positions: S1, P?, I?, C?, E5 (E cannot be 5). So E must be in 3 or 4.  
“SPICE” puts E in 5, which is forbidden.  

Next: “SLEEP”:
- S, L, E, E, P. Again E in 5 is bad.  

“SIEPS” – not a valid word.  

“SIPED”:
- S, I, P, E, D.  
Positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), P?, E4 (ok), D?.  
No ruled-out letters. Valid word.  

But let’s pick a more common word. “SPIKE”:
- S, P, I, K, E.  
Positions: S1 (ok), P?, I?, K?, E5 (forbidden). E in 5 is bad.  

“SICKO” – O is ruled out.  

“SIGHT” – T ruled out.  

“SIPSY” – Y is new, but double S.  

“SIFTH” – T ruled out.  

“SIFTE” – T ruled out.  

“SIEVE” – E twice, but valid.  

“SIEVE” seems the best among options, or “SIPES” (double S).  

A better choice: “SIEPS” invalid.  

Let’s use “SIEVE” as it introduces V and E again.  

Actually, let’s use “SIEVE” but note E appears twice.  

Another valid word: “SIEPS” – invalid.  

“SIEVE” is acceptable.  

But to avoid repeating E, let’s try “SICKS” – invalid (double S).  

“SICKY” – Y new, but valid.  

“SICKY” positions: S1 (ok), I2 (ok), C?, K?, Y?.  
Valid word, introduces C and K.  

Let’s choose “SICKY”.

Wait, let’s pick “SIEVE” because it keeps S, I, E together and introduces V.  

But “SIEVE” has E in 5, which is forbidden.  

So E must be in 3 or 4.  

Let’s use “SLEEP” – E in 4 (ok).  

“SLEEP” is valid, introduces L and P.  

Yes, “SLEEP” is good.  

Final choice: “SLEEP”.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, L, P  
Letters that ARE in the word: S, E, I, and two more letters from the still-unused pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Specific positional information:
- S is not in position 1 (from STEIN and SLEEP) and not in position 4 (from AROSE).  So S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E is not in position 2 (from STEIN) and not in position 5 (from AROSE).  It is confirmed in position 4 (from SLEEP).  So E is fixed at position 4.
- I is not in position 4 (from STEIN) and not in position 3 (from SLEEP).  So I must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are still open except for the above constraints.

We need two more distinct letters (not yet used) to fill the remaining three slots (since E is locked at 4).  We want common letters to maximize information.

Candidate word structure: _ _ _ E _

Possible placements:
- S must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- The remaining two letters must come from the unused set.

Let’s try S in position 2 and I in position 1:
Word form: I S _ E _

Need two more letters.  Common unused letters: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, Y.

Let’s pick C and K to form ""ISKED"" – but that’s not a valid word.

""ISKEE"" – invalid (double E).

""ISKEW"" – invalid.

""ISKEB"" – invalid.

""ISKEF"" – invalid.

Alternative: S in position 3 and I in position 1:
Word form: I _ S E _

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""ICASE"" – invalid (A ruled out).

""IGOSE"" – O ruled out.

""IMISE"" – invalid.

""IVISE"" – invalid.

""INISE"" – N ruled out.

""ISKED"" – invalid.

""ISKEW"" – invalid.

Alternative: S in position 5 and I in position 1:

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""ICERS"" – valid word, uses C and R (R is already ruled out).

""IGELS"" – invalid.

""IMBES"" – invalid.

""IVENS"" – N ruled out.

""IZENS"" – Z and N ruled out.

Alternative: I in position 2 and S in position 3:

Need two letters.  Let’s try ""CISSE"" – invalid.

""DISSE"" – invalid.

""GISSE"" – invalid.

""VISSE"" – invalid.

""MISSY"" – invalid.

""KISSE"" – invalid.

Alternative: I in position 5 and S in position 2:

""DSKIE"" – invalid.

""FSKIE"" – invalid.

""GSKIE"" – invalid.

""HSKIE"" – invalid.

""VSIE"" – too short.

""WSKIE"" – invalid.

""GSKIE"" – invalid.

""HSKIE"" – invalid.

""VSIE"" – too short.

""WSKIE"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""ICASE"" – invalid.

""IGOSE"" – O ruled out.

""IMISE"" – invalid.

""IZISE"" – invalid.

Alternative: I in position 2 and S in position 5:
Word form: _ I _ E S

Let’s try ""CIGES"" – invalid.

""DIRKS"" – invalid.

""DISKS"" – S already used.

""DIVES"" – V and D unused, valid word.

""DIVES"" has D, I, V, E, S.  D and V are new, I in 2, S in 5, E in 4.  This fits all constraints.

Check constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 – it’s in 5.  OK.
- E in 4 – confirmed.  OK.
- I not in 3 or 4 – it’s in 2.  OK.
- No A, R, O, T, N, L, P.  A, R, O, T, N, L, P are all excluded.  D and V are new.  The word ""DIVES"" is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ""DIVES"".

From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, N, L, P, D, V  
Letters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions:  
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  

So the word structure is: _ I _ E S

We still need two more letters for positions 1 and 3, chosen from the unused alphabet: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We want common English letters to maximize information. The most frequent remaining consonants are C, F, G, H, K, M.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ I _ E S:

- B I _ E S → B I K E S (valid)  
- C I _ E S → C I F E S (invalid), C I K E S (valid)  
- F I _ E S → F I K E S (valid)  
- G I _ E S → G I K E S (valid)  
- H I _ E S → H I K E S (valid)  
- M I _ E S → M I K E S (valid)  

All these words use new letters (C, K, F, G, H, M) that haven’t been tested yet. Among these, ""C I K E S"" (CITES) is a common word and uses two new letters (C and K) efficiently.

Therefore, the next guess is ""CITES"".
