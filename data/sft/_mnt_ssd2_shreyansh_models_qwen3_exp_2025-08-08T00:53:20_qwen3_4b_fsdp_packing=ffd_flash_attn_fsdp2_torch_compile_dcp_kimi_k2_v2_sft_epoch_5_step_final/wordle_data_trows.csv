For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: correct position (✓) → O is in position 3
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere except position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E
- S cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try a word that keeps R and O in place, puts S in a new spot, and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F: new letter
- R: stays in position 2 (✓)
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- S is not used here, but we can test S in position 1 or 5 in the next guess if needed.

However, since S must be in the word, let’s try to include S in a new position. A better choice might be “SWORD”:
- S: new position (1)
- W: new letter
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- R: stays in position 4? Wait, no, R is in position 2 from feedback. So SWORD would place R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback.

Let me correct: the pattern is _ R O _ _. So the word must have R in position 2 and O in position 3. A word like “CROCS” would fit, but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet. 

Another option: “GROSS” – but S is in position 4, which is invalid. 

“BROTH” – but H is new and we don’t know about it. 

“PROXY” – but Y is uncommon. 

“TROOP” – but P is new and we don’t know about P. 

A better approach: use a word with S in position 1 or 5. Let’s try “SWORD” again, but ensure R is in position 2 and O in position 3. Actually, “SWORD” doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Wait, the correct pattern is _ R O _ _. So possible words: 
- C R O W D
- P R O W L
- F R O N T
- B R O W N
- T R O P E

“FRONT” seems good: F, R, O, N, T. This tests new letters while keeping R and O fixed. 

But we know S must be in the word, so let’s try “CROCS” – but C is repeated. 

“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N. This tests G and I. 

“DROOL” – D, R, O, O, L. Double O is possible. 

“BROIL” – B, R, O, I, L. Tests B, I, L. 

I think “FRONT” is a solid choice to test new consonants and N. 

But to include S, let’s try “SWORD” again, but realize it doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Realization: we need a word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and S must appear somewhere. The only positions left for S are 1 or 5. 

Possible candidates:
- S R O _ _ : but S cannot be in position 1 because then R would be in position 2 (✓) and O in position 3 (✓), but S is in position 1. However, the word would be S R O _ _, which is possible. Examples: SROCK, SRONS, etc. But these are not common words. 

- _ R O S _ : S in position 4 is invalid (from feedback S was in position 4 and marked wrong). So S must be in position 5: _ R O _ S. 

Thus, the word must be _ R O _ S. 

Common words fitting this: 
- C R O W S
- P R O W S
- B R O W S
- T R O W S
- F R O N S (but N is position 4, S is 5)

“CROWS” is a valid word: C, R, O, W, S. This includes S in position 5, keeps R in 2 and O in 3, and tests C and W. 

This seems optimal. Let’s go with CROWS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: correct position (✓) → O is in position 3
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere except position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E
- S cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try a word that keeps R and O in place, puts S in a new spot, and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F: new letter
- R: stays in position 2 (✓)
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- S is not used here, but we can test S in position 1 or 5 in the next guess if needed.

However, since S must be in the word, let’s try to include S in a new position. A better choice might be “SWORD”:
- S: new position (1)
- W: new letter
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- R: stays in position 4? Wait, no, R is in position 2 from feedback. So SWORD would place R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback.

Let me correct: the pattern is _ R O _ _. So the word must have R in position 2 and O in position 3. A word like “CROCS” would fit, but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet. 

Another option: “GROSS” – but S is in position 4, which is invalid. 

“BROTH” – but H is new and we don’t know about it. 

“PROXY” – but Y is uncommon. 

“TROOP” – but P is new and we don’t know about P. 

A better approach: use a word with S in position 1 or 5. Let’s try “SWORD” again, but ensure R is in position 2 and O in position 3. Actually, “SWORD” doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Wait, the correct pattern is _ R O _ _. So possible words: 
- C R O W D
- P R O W L
- F R O N T
- B R O W N
- T R O P E

“FRONT” seems good: F, R, O, N, T. This tests new letters while keeping R and O fixed. 

But we know S must be in the word, so let’s try “CROCS” – but C is repeated. 

“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N. This tests G and I. 

“DROOL” – D, R, O, O, L. Double O is possible. 

“BROIL” – B, R, O, I, L. Tests B, I, L. 

I think “FRONT” is a solid choice to test new consonants and N. 

But to include S, let’s try “SWORD” again, but realize it doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Realization: we need a word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and S must appear somewhere. The only positions left for S are 1 or 5. 

Possible candidates:
- S R O _ _ : but S cannot be in position 1 because then R would be in position 2 (✓) and O in position 3 (✓), but S is in position 1. However, the word would be S R O _ _, which is possible. Examples: SROCK, SRONS, etc. But these are not common words. 

- _ R O S _ : S in position 4 is invalid (from feedback S was in position 4 and marked wrong). So S must be in position 5: _ R O _ S. 

Thus, the word must be _ R O _ S. 

Common words fitting this: 
- C R O W S
- P R O W S
- B R O W S
- T R O W S
- F R O N S (but N is position 4, S is 5)

“CROWS” is a valid word: C, R, O, W, S. This includes S in position 5, keeps R in 2 and O in 3, and tests C and W. 

This seems optimal. Let’s go with CROWS.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: correct position (✓) → O is in position 3
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere except position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E
- S cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try a word that keeps R and O in place, puts S in a new spot, and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F: new letter
- R: stays in position 2 (✓)
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- S is not used here, but we can test S in position 1 or 5 in the next guess if needed.

However, since S must be in the word, let’s try to include S in a new position. A better choice might be “SWORD”:
- S: new position (1)
- W: new letter
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- R: stays in position 4? Wait, no, R is in position 2 from feedback. So SWORD would place R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback.

Let me correct: the pattern is _ R O _ _. So the word must have R in position 2 and O in position 3. A word like “CROCS” would fit, but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet. 

Another option: “GROSS” – but S is in position 4, which is invalid. 

“BROTH” – but H is new and we don’t know about it. 

“PROXY” – but Y is uncommon. 

“TROOP” – but P is new and we don’t know about P. 

A better approach: use a word with S in position 1 or 5. Let’s try “SWORD” again, but ensure R is in position 2 and O in position 3. Actually, “SWORD” doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Wait, the correct pattern is _ R O _ _. So possible words: 
- C R O W D
- P R O W L
- F R O N T
- B R O W N
- T R O P E

“FRONT” seems good: F, R, O, N, T. This tests new letters while keeping R and O fixed. 

But we know S must be in the word, so let’s try “CROCS” – but C is repeated. 

“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N. This tests G and I. 

“DROOL” – D, R, O, O, L. Double O is possible. 

“BROIL” – B, R, O, I, L. Tests B, I, L. 

I think “FRONT” is a solid choice to test new consonants and N. 

But to include S, let’s try “SWORD” again, but realize it doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Realization: we need a word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and S must appear somewhere. The only positions left for S are 1 or 5. 

Possible candidates:
- S R O _ _ : but S cannot be in position 1 because then R would be in position 2 (✓) and O in position 3 (✓), but S is in position 1. However, the word would be S R O _ _, which is possible. Examples: SROCK, SRONS, etc. But these are not common words. 

- _ R O S _ : S in position 4 is invalid (from feedback S was in position 4 and marked wrong). So S must be in position 5: _ R O _ S. 

Thus, the word must be _ R O _ S. 

Common words fitting this: 
- C R O W S
- P R O W S
- B R O W S
- T R O W S
- F R O N S (but N is position 4, S is 5)

“CROWS” is a valid word: C, R, O, W, S. This includes S in position 5, keeps R in 2 and O in 3, and tests C and W. 

This seems optimal. Let’s go with CROWS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is in position 2
- O: correct position (✓) → O is in position 3
- S: in the word but wrong position (-) → S is somewhere except position 4
- E: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters in word: R, O, S
- Letters not in word: A, E
- S cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try a word that keeps R and O in place, puts S in a new spot, and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F: new letter
- R: stays in position 2 (✓)
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- S is not used here, but we can test S in position 1 or 5 in the next guess if needed.

However, since S must be in the word, let’s try to include S in a new position. A better choice might be “SWORD”:
- S: new position (1)
- W: new letter
- O: stays in position 3 (✓)
- R: stays in position 4? Wait, no, R is in position 2 from feedback. So SWORD would place R in position 4, which contradicts the feedback.

Let me correct: the pattern is _ R O _ _. So the word must have R in position 2 and O in position 3. A word like “CROCS” would fit, but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet. 

Another option: “GROSS” – but S is in position 4, which is invalid. 

“BROTH” – but H is new and we don’t know about it. 

“PROXY” – but Y is uncommon. 

“TROOP” – but P is new and we don’t know about P. 

A better approach: use a word with S in position 1 or 5. Let’s try “SWORD” again, but ensure R is in position 2 and O in position 3. Actually, “SWORD” doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Wait, the correct pattern is _ R O _ _. So possible words: 
- C R O W D
- P R O W L
- F R O N T
- B R O W N
- T R O P E

“FRONT” seems good: F, R, O, N, T. This tests new letters while keeping R and O fixed. 

But we know S must be in the word, so let’s try “CROCS” – but C is repeated. 

“GROIN” – G, R, O, I, N. This tests G and I. 

“DROOL” – D, R, O, O, L. Double O is possible. 

“BROIL” – B, R, O, I, L. Tests B, I, L. 

I think “FRONT” is a solid choice to test new consonants and N. 

But to include S, let’s try “SWORD” again, but realize it doesn’t fit _ R O _ _. 

Realization: we need a word with R in position 2 and O in position 3, and S must appear somewhere. The only positions left for S are 1 or 5. 

Possible candidates:
- S R O _ _ : but S cannot be in position 1 because then R would be in position 2 (✓) and O in position 3 (✓), but S is in position 1. However, the word would be S R O _ _, which is possible. Examples: SROCK, SRONS, etc. But these are not common words. 

- _ R O S _ : S in position 4 is invalid (from feedback S was in position 4 and marked wrong). So S must be in position 5: _ R O _ S. 

Thus, the word must be _ R O _ S. 

Common words fitting this: 
- C R O W S
- P R O W S
- B R O W S
- T R O W S
- F R O N S (but N is position 4, S is 5)

“CROWS” is a valid word: C, R, O, W, S. This includes S in position 5, keeps R in 2 and O in 3, and tests C and W. 

This seems optimal. Let’s go with CROWS.
