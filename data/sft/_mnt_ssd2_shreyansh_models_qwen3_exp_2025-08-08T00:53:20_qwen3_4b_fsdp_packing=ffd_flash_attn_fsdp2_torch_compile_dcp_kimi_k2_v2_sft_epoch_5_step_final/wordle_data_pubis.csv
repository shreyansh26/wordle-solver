### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters from these to test as many as possible. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

From the feedback on AROSE:

2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:

- SLANT (but has A which is excluded)
- SPLIT (but has P and I)
- STINK (but has I and N, K)
- SLING (but has I and N, G)

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.

3. Position constraints so far:

   - I is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and I exactly once each.  
- Contains none of A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.

- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
So “SLICK” is invalid.

Next candidate: “SPICY”  
- Contains S and I.  
- Contains C, P, Y (all allowed).

Next: “FILMS” – contains I and S, but S is 5th (allowed), I is 2nd (allowed).

Possible candidates:
- WISPS – but P is allowed, W is allowed. I is in position 2 (allowed). Ends with S. Letters: W, I, S, P, S – but S repeats, which is fine since S is already confirmed. However, we don’t know if S repeats, so let’s avoid double letters for now.
- DICUS – but U is allowed, D, C are allowed. I is in position 2. Ends with S. But DICUS is not a common 5-letter word.
- PIVOT – but ends with T, which is forbidden.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters from these to test as many as possible. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but S is NOT in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STUMP (but has U and P which are less common)
- SLANT (but has A which is excluded)
- SPLIT (but has P and I)
- STINK (but has I and N, K)
- SLING (but has I and N, G)

A good balance is ""STING"" - uses S (not in 4th), T, I, N, G. Avoids A, R, O, E.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and I (both marked “-”, so they appear but are in wrong positions).  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is not in position 1 or 4.  
   - I is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and I exactly once each.  
- Contains none of A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.  
- Places I somewhere other than position 3.

Remaining common letters we can still use: D, L, C, U, M, Y, P, B, H, K, F, W, V, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all these rules is “SLICK”:
- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
So “SLICK” is invalid.

Next candidate: “SPICY”  
- Contains S and I.  
- Contains C, P, Y (all allowed).  
- S is in position 1 → again invalid (S cannot be 1st).

Next: “CUBIC” – doesn’t contain S or I.

Next: “SUSHI” – contains S twice and I, but S is in positions 1 and 3 (position 1 is invalid).

Next: “SULKS” – S is in positions 1 and 5, I is missing.

Next: “FILMS” – contains I and S, but S is 5th (allowed), I is 2nd (allowed).  
Check letters: F, I, L, M, S – none are in the forbidden list.  
Positions:  
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4) – OK.  
- I is in position 2 (not 3) – OK.  

“FILMS” satisfies all constraints.

with the constraints:
- Must contain I exactly once.
- I cannot be in position 3 (from earlier feedback).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, L, M, X, Y.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, Z (plus I).

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, ending with S, containing I somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since position 3 is forbidden for I), and using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- PIVOT – but ends with T (forbidden).
- PICS – too short.
- PISCS – invalid.
- PIVYS – Y is forbidden.
- PIBYS – B is allowed, Y is forbidden.
- PIZZA – ends with A (forbidden).
- PITCH – ends with H, but needs to end with S.
- PIVOT – already invalid.
- PIVTS – invalid.
- PIVMS – M is forbidden.
- PIVDS – D is allowed: P I V D S – but is PIVDS a word? No.
- PIVKS – K is allowed: P I V K S – not a word.
- PIVBS – B is allowed: P I V B S – not a word.
- PIVHS – H is allowed: P I V H S – not a word.
- PIVWS – W is allowed: P I V W S – not a word.
- PIVUS – U is allowed: P I V U S – not a word.
- PIVQS – Q is allowed: P I V Q S – not a word.
- PIVJS – J is allowed: P I V J S – not a word.
- PIVKS – already considered.
- PIVDS – already considered.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the I is in position 2 or 4.

Possible words:
- P I _ _ S
- P _ I _ S
- P _ _ I S

But position 3 is forbidden for I, so P _ I _ S is invalid (I in position 3). So possible patterns:
- P I _ _ S
- P _ _ I S

But position 5 is S, so:

Pattern 1: P I _ _ S
Need 3rd and 4th letters from remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, Z).

Possible words:
- P I C K S – PICKS – valid word. Letters: P, I, C, K, S – all allowed. I is in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 5 (correct). P is in position 1 (correct). No forbidden letters.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Pattern 2: P _ _ I S
Need 2nd and 3rd letters from allowed letters. Possible:
- P U B I S – PUBIS – valid word. But let's check letters: P, U, B, I, S – all allowed. I is in position 4 (allowed). P and S correct positions. This is also valid.

Between PICKS and PUBIS, both are valid. PICKS seems more common.

But let me verify:
- PICKS: P I C K S
  - P: position 1 – correct (✓)
  - I: position 2 – allowed (-)
  - C: allowed (not in forbidden list)
  - K: allowed
  - S: position 5 – correct (✓)
  - No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, L, M, X, Y) – none are present.

This seems perfect.

Therefore, the next guess is PICKS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique letters from these to test as many as possible. 

Some good options would be:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but S is NOT in the 4th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses S (but not in position 4)
- Avoids A, R, O, E
- Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STUMP (but has U and P which are less common)
- SLANT (but has A which is excluded)
- SPLIT (but has P and I)
- STINK (but has I and N, K)
- SLING (but has I and N, G)

A good balance is ""STING"" - uses S (not in 4th), T, I, N, G. Avoids A, R, O, E.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and I (both marked “-”, so they appear but are in wrong positions).  
3. Position constraints so far:
   - S is not in position 1 or 4.  
   - I is not in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and I exactly once each.  
- Contains none of A, R, O, E, T, N, G.  
- Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.  
- Places I somewhere other than position 3.

Remaining common letters we can still use: D, L, C, U, M, Y, P, B, H, K, F, W, V, etc.

A good candidate that satisfies all these rules is “SLICK”:
- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
So “SLICK” is invalid.

Next candidate: “SPICY”  
- Contains S and I.  
- Contains C, P, Y (all allowed).  
- S is in position 1 → again invalid (S cannot be 1st).

Next: “CUBIC” – doesn’t contain S or I.

Next: “SUSHI” – contains S twice and I, but S is in positions 1 and 3 (position 1 is invalid).

Next: “SULKS” – S is in positions 1 and 5, I is missing.

Next: “FILMS” – contains I and S, but S is 5th (allowed), I is 2nd (allowed).  
Check letters: F, I, L, M, S – none are in the forbidden list.  
Positions:  
- S is in position 5 (not 1 or 4) – OK.  
- I is in position 2 (not 3) – OK.  

“FILMS” satisfies all constraints.

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(x) M(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on FILMS:
- F, L, M are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — we already knew S was in the word, now we also know I is in it.
- S is in the correct position (✓) — position 5.

So we now know:
1. Word ends with S (position 5 is S).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, L, M.
3. Letters that ARE in the word: S (already fixed at position 5), I (somewhere except position 3).
4. Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones): B, C, D, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and S).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains I exactly once, and I is not in position 3.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s look for words ending in S that contain I but not in position 3.

Possible candidates:
- WISPS – but P is allowed, W is allowed. I is in position 2 (allowed). Ends with S. Letters: W, I, S, P, S – but S repeats, which is fine since S is already confirmed. However, we don’t know if S repeats, so let’s avoid double letters for now.
- DICUS – but U is allowed, D, C are allowed. I is in position 2. Ends with S. But DICUS is not a common 5-letter word.
- PIVOT – but ends with T, which is forbidden.
- BIKIS – ends with S, I in position 3 – but I cannot be in position 3.
- CHIPS – ends with S, I in position 3 – forbidden.
- DICKS – ends with S, I in position 3 – forbidden.
- VICOS – ends with S, I in position 2. Letters: V, I, C, O, S – but O is forbidden.
- WICKS – ends with S, I in position 3 – forbidden.
- PIXYS – ends with S, I in position 2. Letters: P, I, X, Y, S – all allowed (P, I, X, Y, S not in forbidden list). I is in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 5 (correct). This seems valid.

 PIXYS:
- Ends with S (position 5) – confirmed correct.
- Contains I in position 2 (not 3) – allowed.
- Uses only allowed letters P, I, X, Y, S – none are in the forbidden list.

Therefore, PIXYS is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on PICKS:
- P(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- K(x) – K is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) – position 5 is correct.

So the pattern is still P _ _ _ S, and the only remaining letter we know must appear is I.  
We also know:
- I cannot be in position 2 (from PICKS feedback) or position 3 (from earlier).  
- Therefore I must be in position 4.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, F, L, M, X, Y, C, K.

Allowed letters left: B, D, H, J, Q, U, V, W, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P, ends with S.
- Has I in position 4.
- Uses only allowed letters in positions 2 and 3.

Word structure: P _ _ I S

Possible candidates:
- P U B I S – PUBIS (valid, but less common)
- P U D I S – not a word
- P U H I S – not a word
- P U J I S – not a word
- P U Q I S – not a word
- P U V I S – not a word
- P U W I S – not a word
- P U Z I S – not a word
- P U B I S – PUBIS is the only valid one.

But let me double-check: is PUBIS a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it's the plural of pubis.

So the word must be PUBIS.
