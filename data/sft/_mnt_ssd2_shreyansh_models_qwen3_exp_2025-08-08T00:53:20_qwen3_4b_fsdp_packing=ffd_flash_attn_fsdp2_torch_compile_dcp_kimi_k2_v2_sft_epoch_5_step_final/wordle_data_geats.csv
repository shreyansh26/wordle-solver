### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 = A (from both guesses)
- Position 4 = T (from Guess 1)
- The word must contain S and E (both appeared as “-” in both guesses, so they are present but not in the positions tried so far).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L (from Guess 1), K (from Guess 2).
- Positions already ruled out for S: 1 (Guess 1 and 2), 1 (Guess 2).  
  Positions still possible for S: 2, 3, 4, 5.  But 3 is A, 4 is T, so only 2 or 5.
- Positions ruled out for E: 2 (Guess 2), 3 (Guess 1), 4 (Guess 1).  
  So E must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4.
- Contains S (in position 2 or 5) and E (in position 1 or 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no L, no K).

Possible patterns:
- If E is in position 1: E _ A T _
- If E is in position 5: _ _ A T E

Let’s try the second pattern first because it fixes E in position 5 and leaves position 2 open for S or another letter.  
We still need S somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are open (except position 2 can’t be S because we haven’t ruled that out yet).  
A common word fitting this: “SHARE” – but H hasn’t been tested and R hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SNARE” – but N hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SPARE” – P hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SWATE” – but W hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SATEX” – but X is rare.  
Another: “SALET” – but L is out.  
Another: “SAPES” – but S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s pick “SHARE” because H and R are common letters we haven’t used yet.

Pattern check:
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 ✓
- R: new letter
- E: position 5 (allowed)
- S: position 2 (allowed)

This tests H and R while respecting all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after three guesses.

Known positions:
- Position 3 = A (✓ in all three guesses)
- Position 4 = T (✓ in Guess 1, still present in word; the “-” in STEAK only means T is not in position 2)

Letters that must appear:
- S (always “-”, so it is in the word but never in the position guessed so far: 1, 2, 3, 5 → only possible position left is 4, but position 4 is T.  This is impossible.  Wait, let’s recheck S positions:

S has been tried in:
- SLATE: position 1 → “-”
- STEAK: position 1 → “-”
- SHARE: position 1 → “-”

So S has been tried in position 1 three times and always marked “-”.  That means S is NOT in position 1.  But position 4 is T, position 3 is A, so S has nowhere left to be.  This contradiction shows my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In STEAK, T is in position 2 and gets “-”, which means T is in the word but not in position 2.  Since T was already ✓ in position 4 in SLATE, this is consistent: T is in position 4.

Now re-evaluate S:
- S has been tried in positions 1 (SLATE, STEAK, SHARE) and always “-”.  The only way this can happen is if S is in the word but not in position 1.  However, positions 2, 3, 4, 5 have been checked implicitly or explicitly:
  - Position 2: never directly tested for S
  - Position 3: A
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: never directly tested for S

So S could be in position 2 or 5.

Letters that must appear:
- S (in position 2 or 5)
- E (always “-”, so E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 as per the feedback.  Wait, let’s list E positions:

E has been tried in:
- SLATE: position 5 → “-” → E not in 5
- STEAK: position 3 → “-” → E not in 3
- SHARE: position 5 → “-” → E not in 5

So E must be in position 1 or 2.

Letters that are out: L, K, H, R.

Known pattern:
- _ _ A T _

We need:
- E in 1 or 2
- S in 2 or 5
- No L, K, H, R

Possible patterns:
1. E _ A T _ → E in 1, then S must be in 2 or 5.  But position 2 is open.  Word must be E S A T _ or E _ A T S.  ESATS is invalid.  E S A T _ → need a valid word: ESATE?  Not valid.  E M A T S?  But M not tested yet.  E S A T E?  But E already in 1.  Not working.

2. _ _ A T E → E in 5, then S must be in 2.  So pattern: _ S A T E.  Valid words: B SATE?  No.  C SATE?  No.  D SATE?  No.  F SATE?  No.  G SATE?  No.  J SATE?  No.  M SATE?  No.  N SATE?  No.  P SATE?  No.  Q SATE?  No.  V SATE?  No.  W SATE?  No.  Y SATE?  No.  Z SATE?  No.  None of these are valid English words.

This suggests an inconsistency.  Re-examining the feedback:

Wait, in SHARE, the feedback was S(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) E(-).  This means:
- S is in word but not in position 1
- H is not in word
- A is correct in position 3
- R is not in word
- E is in word but not in position 5

So E must be in position 2 (since 1,3,4,5 have been ruled out).

Thus the pattern is:
- _ E A T _

And S must be in position 2 or 5.  But position 2 is E, so S must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ E A T S

Now we need a valid 5-letter word ending in EATS with E in position 2 and A in 3, T in 4, S in 5.  The only common word is:

B E A T S → B is untested and valid.

Let’s verify:
- B: new letter
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- A: position 3 (✓)
- T: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: correct position (3rd letter is A)
- T: correct position (4th letter is T)
- E: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 1,2,5)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A T _
- Must contain S and E somewhere (but not in their original positions)
- Cannot contain L

Good next guesses should test new common letters while respecting the known pattern. I’ll try a word that:
- Keeps A and T in place
- Places S in a new position (1 or 2)
- Places E in a new position (1,2,5)
- Introduces other common consonants

A strong candidate is ""STEAK"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T in position 4 (matches ✓)
- A in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E in position 2 (new position)
- Introduces K (common ending letter) and avoids L

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 = A (from both guesses)
- Position 4 = T (from Guess 1)
- The word must contain S and E (both appeared as “-” in both guesses, so they are present but not in the positions tried so far).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L (from Guess 1), K (from Guess 2).
- Positions already ruled out for S: 1 (Guess 1 and 2), 1 (Guess 2).  
  Positions still possible for S: 2, 3, 4, 5.  But 3 is A, 4 is T, so only 2 or 5.
- Positions ruled out for E: 2 (Guess 2), 3 (Guess 1), 4 (Guess 1).  
  So E must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4.
- Contains S (in position 2 or 5) and E (in position 1 or 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no L, no K).

Possible patterns:
- If E is in position 1: E _ A T _
- If E is in position 5: _ _ A T E

Let’s try the second pattern first because it fixes E in position 5 and leaves position 2 open for S or another letter.  
We still need S somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are open (except position 2 can’t be S because we haven’t ruled that out yet).  
A common word fitting this: “SHARE” – but H hasn’t been tested and R hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SNARE” – but N hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SPARE” – P hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SWATE” – but W hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SATEX” – but X is rare.  
Another: “SALET” – but L is out.  
Another: “SAPES” – but S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s pick “SHARE” because H and R are common letters we haven’t used yet.

Pattern check:
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 ✓
- R: new letter
- E: position 5 (allowed)
- S: position 2 (allowed)

This tests H and R while respecting all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 2-5)
- L: not in the word at all
- A: correct position (3rd letter is A)
- T: correct position (4th letter is T)
- E: in the word but wrong position (must be in positions 1,2,5)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A T _
- Must contain S and E somewhere (but not in their original positions)
- Cannot contain L

Good next guesses should test new common letters while respecting the known pattern. I’ll try a word that:
- Keeps A and T in place
- Places S in a new position (1 or 2)
- Places E in a new position (1,2,5)
- Introduces other common consonants

A strong candidate is ""STEAK"":
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T in position 4 (matches ✓)
- A in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E in position 2 (new position)
- Introduces K (common ending letter) and avoids L

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 = A (from both guesses)
- Position 4 = T (from Guess 1)
- The word must contain S and E (both appeared as “-” in both guesses, so they are present but not in the positions tried so far).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L (from Guess 1), K (from Guess 2).
- Positions already ruled out for S: 1 (Guess 1 and 2), 1 (Guess 2).  
  Positions still possible for S: 2, 3, 4, 5.  But 3 is A, 4 is T, so only 2 or 5.
- Positions ruled out for E: 2 (Guess 2), 3 (Guess 1), 4 (Guess 1).  
  So E must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and T in position 4.
- Contains S (in position 2 or 5) and E (in position 1 or 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no L, no K).

Possible patterns:
- If E is in position 1: E _ A T _
- If E is in position 5: _ _ A T E

Let’s try the second pattern first because it fixes E in position 5 and leaves position 2 open for S or another letter.  
We still need S somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are open (except position 2 can’t be S because we haven’t ruled that out yet).  
A common word fitting this: “SHARE” – but H hasn’t been tested and R hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SNARE” – but N hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SPARE” – P hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SWATE” – but W hasn’t been tested.  
Another: “SATEX” – but X is rare.  
Another: “SALET” – but L is out.  
Another: “SAPES” – but S would be in position 5, which is allowed.

Let’s pick “SHARE” because H and R are common letters we haven’t used yet.

Pattern check:
- H: new letter
- A: position 3 ✓
- R: new letter
- E: position 5 (allowed)
- S: position 2 (allowed)

This tests H and R while respecting all constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after three guesses.

Known positions:
- Position 3 = A (✓ in all three guesses)
- Position 4 = T (✓ in Guess 1, still present in word; the “-” in STEAK only means T is not in position 2)

Letters that must appear:
- S (always “-”, so it is in the word but never in the position guessed so far: 1, 2, 3, 5 → only possible position left is 4, but position 4 is T.  This is impossible.  Wait, let’s recheck S positions:

S has been tried in:
- SLATE: position 1 → “-”
- STEAK: position 1 → “-”
- SHARE: position 1 → “-”

So S has been tried in position 1 three times and always marked “-”.  That means S is NOT in position 1.  But position 4 is T, position 3 is A, so S has nowhere left to be.  This contradiction shows my earlier assumption was wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:
- In STEAK, T is in position 2 and gets “-”, which means T is in the word but not in position 2.  Since T was already ✓ in position 4 in SLATE, this is consistent: T is in position 4.

Now re-evaluate S:
- S has been tried in positions 1 (SLATE, STEAK, SHARE) and always “-”.  The only way this can happen is if S is in the word but not in position 1.  However, positions 2, 3, 4, 5 have been checked implicitly or explicitly:
  - Position 2: never directly tested for S
  - Position 3: A
  - Position 4: T
  - Position 5: never directly tested for S

So S could be in position 2 or 5.

Letters that must appear:
- S (in position 2 or 5)
- E (always “-”, so E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 as per the feedback.  Wait, let’s list E positions:

E has been tried in:
- SLATE: position 5 → “-” → E not in 5
- STEAK: position 3 → “-” → E not in 3
- SHARE: position 5 → “-” → E not in 5

So E must be in position 1 or 2.

Letters that are out: L, K, H, R.

Known pattern:
- _ _ A T _

We need:
- E in 1 or 2
- S in 2 or 5
- No L, K, H, R

Possible patterns:
1. E _ A T _ → E in 1, then S must be in 2 or 5.  But position 2 is open.  Word must be E S A T _ or E _ A T S.  ESATS is invalid.  E S A T _ → need a valid word: ESATE?  Not valid.  E M A T S?  But M not tested yet.  E S A T E?  But E already in 1.  Not working.

2. _ _ A T E → E in 5, then S must be in 2.  So pattern: _ S A T E.  Valid words: B SATE?  No.  C SATE?  No.  D SATE?  No.  F SATE?  No.  G SATE?  No.  J SATE?  No.  M SATE?  No.  N SATE?  No.  P SATE?  No.  Q SATE?  No.  V SATE?  No.  W SATE?  No.  Y SATE?  No.  Z SATE?  No.  None of these are valid English words.

This suggests an inconsistency.  Re-examining the feedback:

Wait, in SHARE, the feedback was S(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) E(-).  This means:
- S is in word but not in position 1
- H is not in word
- A is correct in position 3
- R is not in word
- E is in word but not in position 5

So E must be in position 2 (since 1,3,4,5 have been ruled out).

Thus the pattern is:
- _ E A T _

And S must be in position 2 or 5.  But position 2 is E, so S must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ E A T S

Now we need a valid 5-letter word ending in EATS with E in position 2 and A in 3, T in 4, S in 5.  The only common word is:

B E A T S → B is untested and valid.

Let’s verify:
- B: new letter
- E: position 2 (allowed)
- A: position 3 (✓)
- T: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

This is impossible.  Wait, let’s recheck S positions:\n\nS has been tried in:\n- SLATE: position 1 → “-”\n- STEAK: position 1 → “-”\n- SHARE: position 1 → “-”\n\nSo S has been tried in position 1 three times and always marked “-”.  That means S is NOT in position 1.  But position 4 is T, position 3 is A, so S has nowhere left to be.  This contradiction shows my earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nRe-examining the feedback:\n- In STEAK, T is in position 2 and gets “-”, which means T is in the word but not in position 2.  Since T was already ✓ in position 4 in SLATE, this is consistent: T is in position 4.\n\nNow re-evaluate S:\n- S has been tried in positions 1 (SLATE, STEAK, SHARE) and always “-”.  The only way this can happen is if S is in the word but not in position 1.  However, positions 2, 3, 4, 5 have been checked implicitly or explicitly:\n  - Position 2: never directly tested for S\n  - Position 3: A\n  - Position 4: T\n  - Position 5: never directly tested for S\n\nSo S could be in position 2 or 5.\n\nLetters that must appear:\n- S (in position 2 or 5)\n- E (always “-”, so E is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 as per the feedback.

E _ A T _ → E in 1, then S must be in 2 or 5.  But position 2 is open.  Word must be E S A T _ or E _ A T S.  ESATS is invalid.  E S A T _ → need a valid word: ESATE?  Not valid.  E M A T S?  But M not tested yet.  E S A T E?  But E already in 1.  Not working.\n\n2. _ _ A T E → E in 5, then S must be in 2.  So pattern: _ S A T E.  Valid words: B SATE?  No.  C SATE?  No.  D SATE?  No.  F SATE?  No.  G SATE?  No.  J SATE?  No.  M SATE?  No.  N SATE?  No.  P SATE?  No.  Q SATE?  No.  V SATE?  No.  W SATE?  No.  Y SATE?  No.  Z SATE?  No.  None of these are valid English words.\n\nThis suggests an inconsistency.  Re-examining the feedback:\n\nWait, in SHARE, the feedback was S(-) H(x) A(✓) R(x) E(-).  This means:\n- S is in word but not in position 1\n- H is not in word\n- A is correct in position 3\n- R is not in word\n- E is in word but not in position 5\n\nSo E must be in position 2 (since 1,3,4,5 have been ruled out).\n\nThus the pattern is:\n- _ E A T _\n\nAnd S must be in position 2 or 5.  But position 2 is E, so S must be in position 5.\n\nThus the word must be: _ E A T S\n\nNow we need a valid 5-letter word ending in EATS with E in position 2 and A in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

Common unused consonants left: C, D, G, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

Valid 5-letter words ending in EATS with the first letter from the remaining set:

Among these, “NEATS” is the most common everyday word.  
All other letters (N, P, S, W) are still permissible for the first position.

Therefore, the only remaining logical guess is “NEATS”.
