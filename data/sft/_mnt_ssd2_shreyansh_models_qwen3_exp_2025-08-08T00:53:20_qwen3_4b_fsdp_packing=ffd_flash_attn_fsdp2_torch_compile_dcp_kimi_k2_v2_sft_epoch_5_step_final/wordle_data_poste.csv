For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. The combination of S, L, A, T, E gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it includes O which is a bit more common than L, and E is the most common vowel. However, both are good. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

- O (3rd letter) – - → in the word but not in position 3.
- S (4th letter) – - → in the word but not in position 4.
- E (5th letter) – ✓ → in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters O and S, but:
   - O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STONE), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from STONE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters that have been ruled out: A, R, N (from STONE).
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and S which we know are present.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Uses only still-possible letters.
- Introduces new common consonants to test.

Candidate positions for O: 1, 2, 4  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3  

Let’s try to place O in position 2 and S in position 3. That gives the pattern: _ O S _ E.  
The first and fourth letters must be new consonants from the remaining pool. Common choices are L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is “LOSES”:
- L (new letter, position 1).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- S (allowed in position 3).
- E (already known in position 5).
- S (repetition of S is allowed; we already know S is in the word, so this is valid).

But “LOSES” has two S’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice is “CLOVE”:
- C (new letter, position 1).
- L (new letter, position 2).
- O (allowed in position 3? Wait, O cannot be in position 3 (from STONE feedback)). So “CLOVE” is invalid.

Next try: O in position 1, S in position 2. Pattern: O S _ _ E.  
Possible word: “OSPRE” – but R is ruled out.

Try “OUSTE” – but T is ruled out.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
But then S must be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s pick “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- U (new).
- S (allowed in position 4? No, S cannot be in 4. So invalid).

Try “POISE”:
- P (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- I (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “MOUSE”:
- M (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “COUSE”:
- C (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try O in position 1 and S in position 3: pattern O _ S _ E.  
Possible word: “OVISE” – but V is allowed.

But “OVISE” is not a common English word.

Common word: “OCEAN” – but A and N are ruled out.

Try “OUSTY” – but Y is allowed, but “OUSTY” is uncommon.

Best common word seems “HOUSE” but S is in position 4 which is invalid.

Re-evaluate: O must be in 1,2,4 and S in 2,3.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Try “SMOTE”:
- S (position 1, but S cannot be in 1). Invalid.

Try “SPITE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SCOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SPOKE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Alternative: O in position 2, S in position 3: pattern _ O S _ E.  
Need first and fourth letters new consonants.

Common word: “VOICE” – but I is vowel, and C is new.  
But O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 3 (allowed).  
Letters: V, O, I, C, E.  
V and C are new, allowed.

“VOICE” fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (position 2) and S (position 3).
- Does not contain A, R, N.
- Uses new letters V and I.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. The combination of S, L, A, T, E gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it includes O which is a bit more common than L, and E is the most common vowel. However, both are good. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) – x → not in the word.
- R (2nd letter) – x → not in the word.
- O (3rd letter) – - → in the word but not in position 3.
- S (4th letter) – - → in the word but not in position 4.
- E (5th letter) – ✓ → in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A or R.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Uses O and S in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to test next: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

A strong next guess is ""STONE"":
- S in 1st position (was in 4th, now try 1st).
- T (new letter).
- O in 2nd position (was in 3rd, now try 2nd).
- N (new letter).
- E in 5th (matches known ✓).

This tests S in position 1, O in position 2, and introduces T and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters O and S, but:
   - O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STONE), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from STONE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters that have been ruled out: A, R, N (from STONE).
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and S which we know are present.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Uses only still-possible letters.
- Introduces new common consonants to test.

Candidate positions for O: 1, 2, 4  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3  

Let’s try to place O in position 2 and S in position 3. That gives the pattern: _ O S _ E.  
The first and fourth letters must be new consonants from the remaining pool. Common choices are L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is “LOSES”:
- L (new letter, position 1).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- S (allowed in position 3).
- E (already known in position 5).
- S (repetition of S is allowed; we already know S is in the word, so this is valid).

But “LOSES” has two S’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice is “CLOVE”:
- C (new letter, position 1).
- L (new letter, position 2).
- O (allowed in position 3? Wait, O cannot be in position 3 (from STONE feedback)). So “CLOVE” is invalid.

Next try: O in position 1, S in position 2. Pattern: O S _ _ E.  
Possible word: “OSPRE” – but R is ruled out.

Try “OUSTE” – but T is ruled out.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
But then S must be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s pick “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- U (new).
- S (allowed in position 4? No, S cannot be in 4. So invalid).

Try “POISE”:
- P (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- I (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “MOUSE”:
- M (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “COUSE”:
- C (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try O in position 1 and S in position 3: pattern O _ S _ E.  
Possible word: “OVISE” – but V is allowed.

But “OVISE” is not a common English word.

Common word: “OCEAN” – but A and N are ruled out.

Try “OUSTY” – but Y is allowed, but “OUSTY” is uncommon.

Best common word seems “HOUSE” but S is in position 4 which is invalid.

Re-evaluate: O must be in 1,2,4 and S in 2,3.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Try “SMOTE”:
- S (position 1, but S cannot be in 1). Invalid.

Try “SPITE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SCOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SPOKE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Alternative: O in position 2, S in position 3: pattern _ O S _ E.  
Need first and fourth letters new consonants.

Common word: “VOICE” – but I is vowel, and C is new.  
But O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 3 (allowed).  
Letters: V, O, I, C, E.  
V and C are new, allowed.

“VOICE” fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (position 2) and S (position 3).
- Does not contain A, R, N.
- Uses new letters V and I.

This seems optimal.

- C (4th) – x → not in the word.

- Exact pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), E (position 5), S (from earlier feedback must be present somewhere), and we have ruled out A, R, N, V, I, C.
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from previous feedback: not in 1 from STONE, not in 4 from AROSE, and not in 3 from VOICE? Wait, no: VOICE had S not present, so S is only constrained by earlier guesses.

Wait, let's re-summarize S:

From AROSE: S not in position 4.
From STONE: S not in position 1.
From VOICE: no S at all (since feedback was only V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)), so S is not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? That can't be.

Wait, no: VOICE was V O I C E, so S was not used in VOICE. Therefore S's constraints remain:
- Not in position 1 (STONE)
- Not in position 4 (AROSE)
- Must be in 2,3,5. But 2 is O, 5 is E, so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ O S _ E

- Ruled out so far: A, R, N, V, I, C, T (from STONE), and others.
- Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

- BOSSE: valid word (a ridge or swell).
- MOSSE: valid (German for moss, accepted in English dictionaries).

Known facts
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters O and S, but:

   - S is NOT in position 1 (from STONE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters that have been ruled out: A, R, N (from STONE).
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and S which we know are present.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Uses only still-possible letters.
- Introduces new common consonants to test.

The first and fourth letters must be new consonants from the remaining pool. Common choices are L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is “LOSES”:
- L (new letter, position 1).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- S (allowed in position 3).
- E (already known in position 5).
- S (repetition of S is allowed; we already know S is in the word, so this is valid).

But “LOSES” has two S’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice is “CLOVE”:
- C (new letter, position 1).
- L (new letter, position 2).
- O (allowed in position 3? Wait, O cannot be in position 3 (from STONE feedback)). So “CLOVE” is invalid.

Next try: O in position 1, S in position 2. Pattern: O S _ _ E.  
Possible word: “OSPRE” – but R is ruled out.

Try “OUSTE” – but T is ruled out.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
But then S must be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s pick “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- U (new).
- S (allowed in position 4? No, S cannot be in 4. So invalid).

Try “POISE”:
- P (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- I (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “MOUSE”:
- M (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “COUSE”:
- C (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try O in position 1 and S in position 3: pattern O _ S _ E.  
Possible word: “OVISE” – but V is allowed.

But “OVISE” is not a common English word.

Common word: “OCEAN” – but A and N are ruled out.

Try “OUSTY” – but Y is allowed, but “OUSTY” is uncommon.

Best common word seems “HOUSE” but S is in position 4 which is invalid.

Re-evaluate: O must be in 1,2,4 and S in 2,3.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Try “SMOTE”:
- S (position 1, but S cannot be in 1). Invalid.

Try “SPITE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SCOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SPOKE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Alternative: O in position 2, S in position 3: pattern _ O S _ E.  
Need first and fourth letters new consonants.

Common word: “VOICE” – but I is vowel, and C is new.  
But O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 3 (allowed).  
Letters: V, O, I, C, E.  
V and C are new, allowed.

“VOICE” fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (position 2) and S (position 3).
- Does not contain A, R, N.
- Uses new letters V and I.

This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)

Guess 3: VOICE -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)

From the new feedback on VOICE:
- V (1st) – x → not in the word.
- O (2nd) – ✓ → in the word AND in position 2.
- I (3rd) – x → not in the word.
- C (4th) – x → not in the word.
- E (5th) – ✓ → already known (position 5).

So we now know:
- Exact pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), E (position 5), S (from earlier feedback must be present somewhere), and we have ruled out A, R, N, V, I, C.
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from previous feedback: not in 1 from STONE, not in 4 from AROSE, and not in 3 from VOICE? Wait, no: VOICE had S not present, so S is only constrained by earlier guesses.

Wait, let's re-summarize S:

From AROSE: S not in position 4.
From STONE: S not in position 1.
From VOICE: no S at all (since feedback was only V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)), so S is not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? That can't be.

Wait, no: VOICE was V O I C E, so S was not used in VOICE. Therefore S's constraints remain:
- Not in position 1 (STONE)
- Not in position 4 (AROSE)
- Must be in 2,3,5. But 2 is O, 5 is E, so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ O S _ E

Now we need:
- 1st and 4th letters: new letters not yet ruled out.
- Ruled out so far: A, R, N, V, I, C, T (from STONE), and others.
- Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ O S _ E.

Possible candidates:
- BOSSE
- DOLSE (not a word)
- FOLSE (not a word)
- GOSPE (not a word)
- HOSTE (not a word)
- JOSIE (but I is ruled out)
- LOSER (but R is ruled out)
- MOSSE
- POSSE
- TOSSE (T is ruled out)
- WOSSE (not a word)

Best common words: BOSSE, MOSSE, POSSE.

Check:
- BOSSE: valid word (a ridge or swell).
- MOSSE: valid (German for moss, accepted in English dictionaries).
- POSSE: valid (a group of people, often used in ""posse comitatus"").

Among these, ""POSSE"" is the most common English word.

Thus, the next guess is POSSE.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with POS and ends with E, with the fourth letter being any letter except those already ruled out (A, R, N, V, I, C, T, etc.).

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y.

Valid English words fitting P O S _ E:
- POSSE (already guessed)

- POSGE (not a word)
- POSBE (not a word)
- POSDE (not a word)
- POSFE (not a word)
- POSYE (not a word)
- POSWE (not a word)

The only remaining common word is POSSE, but we've already used it. Since POSSE was the only valid word in this pattern, and we've already confirmed P, O, S, E are correct, the fourth letter must be S (as in POSSE), but we've already guessed that. However, the feedback from POSSE already confirmed P, O, S, E in their correct positions, and the second S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"", which is consistent with the secret word having exactly one S (in position 3), and the second S in POSSE being extra. 

But since we've already confirmed positions 1-4 except the last letter, and position 5 is E, the word must be POSSE. However, we've already guessed POSSE. This suggests that the secret word is POSSE, but we need to verify.

But wait, the feedback from POSSE shows:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-) E(✓)
This implies:
- P, O, S (position 3), E are all correct in their positions.
- The second S in position 4 is in the word but not in position 4, which is impossible because position 3 already has S. This suggests the secret word has exactly one S, which is in position 3, and the second S in POSSE is not part of the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must be P O S _ E with the fourth letter not S. 

But there are no other valid English words starting with POS and ending with E except POSSE. This seems like a contradiction, indicating that the secret word is indeed POSSE, and the feedback is consistent because the second S in POSSE is just an extra letter not in the secret word. 

However, since we've already guessed POSSE and the feedback is as such, the only possible word left is POSSE. But we need to make a guess. Given the pattern P O S _ E and the letters ruled out, there are no other valid words. This suggests that POSSE must be the correct word, despite it being the same as our guess. 

But the rules state that we must guess a valid word, and POSSE is valid. Given the feedback, POSSE is the only possible word left. Therefore, the next guess is POSSE.

But since we've already guessed it once, and we have 6 tries, we can guess it again. However, it's more likely that the word is POSSE, so we'll go with it.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E. These are all very common letters in English 5-letter words. The combination of S, L, A, T, E gives us good coverage of both vowels and consonants.

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because it includes O which is a bit more common than L, and E is the most common vowel. However, both are good. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter) – x → not in the word.

- S (4th letter) – - → in the word but not in position 4.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain A or R.

I want a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Uses O and S in different positions.
- Avoids A and R.
- Uses common letters to maximize information.

Good candidate letters to test next: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, etc.

A strong next guess is ""STONE"":
- S in 1st position (was in 4th, now try 1st).
- T (new letter).
- O in 2nd position (was in 3rd, now try 2nd).
- N (new letter).
- E in 5th (matches known ✓).

This tests S in position 1, O in position 2, and introduces T and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Known facts
1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters O and S, but:
   - O is NOT in position 3 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 again (from STONE), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from STONE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE), so S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters that have been ruled out: A, R, N (from STONE).
4. Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O and S which we know are present.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Uses only still-possible letters.
- Introduces new common consonants to test.

Candidate positions for O: 1, 2, 4  
Candidate positions for S: 2, 3  

Let’s try to place O in position 2 and S in position 3. That gives the pattern: _ O S _ E.  
The first and fourth letters must be new consonants from the remaining pool. Common choices are L, C, D, M, etc.

A good candidate is “LOSES”:
- L (new letter, position 1).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- S (allowed in position 3).
- E (already known in position 5).
- S (repetition of S is allowed; we already know S is in the word, so this is valid).

But “LOSES” has two S’s, which might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice is “CLOVE”:
- C (new letter, position 1).
- L (new letter, position 2).
- O (allowed in position 3? Wait, O cannot be in position 3 (from STONE feedback)). So “CLOVE” is invalid.

Next try: O in position 1, S in position 2. Pattern: O S _ _ E.  
Possible word: “OSPRE” – but R is ruled out.

Try “OUSTE” – but T is ruled out.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
But then S must be in position 2 or 3.

Let’s pick “HOUSE”:
- H (new).
- O (allowed in position 2).
- U (new).
- S (allowed in position 4? No, S cannot be in 4. So invalid).

Try “POISE”:
- P (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- I (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “MOUSE”:
- M (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try “COUSE”:
- C (new).
- O (position 2, allowed).
- U (new).
- S (position 4, not allowed). Invalid.

Try O in position 1 and S in position 3: pattern O _ S _ E.  
Possible word: “OVISE” – but V is allowed.

But “OVISE” is not a common English word.

Common word: “OCEAN” – but A and N are ruled out.

Try “OUSTY” – but Y is allowed, but “OUSTY” is uncommon.

Best common word seems “HOUSE” but S is in position 4 which is invalid.

Re-evaluate: O must be in 1,2,4 and S in 2,3.

Try O in position 4: pattern _ _ _ O E.  
Then S must be in 2 or 3.

Try “SMOTE”:
- S (position 1, but S cannot be in 1). Invalid.

Try “SPITE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SCOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SPOKE”:
- S (position 1, invalid).

Try “SLOPE” again – same issue.

Alternative: O in position 2, S in position 3: pattern _ O S _ E.  
Need first and fourth letters new consonants.

Common word: “VOICE” – but I is vowel, and C is new.  
But O is in position 2 (allowed), S is in position 3 (allowed).  
Letters: V, O, I, C, E.  
V and C are new, allowed.

“VOICE” fits all constraints:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O (position 2) and S (position 3).
- Does not contain A, R, N.
- Uses new letters V and I.

This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: STONE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: VOICE -> FEEDBACK: V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on VOICE:
- V (1st) – x → not in the word.
- O (2nd) – ✓ → in the word AND in position 2.
- I (3rd) – x → not in the word.
- C (4th) – x → not in the word.
- E (5th) – ✓ → already known (position 5).

So we now know:
- Exact pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), E (position 5), S (from earlier feedback must be present somewhere), and we have ruled out A, R, N, V, I, C.
- S must be in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from previous feedback: not in 1 from STONE, not in 4 from AROSE, and not in 3 from VOICE? Wait, no: VOICE had S not present, so S is only constrained by earlier guesses.

Wait, let's re-summarize S:

From AROSE: S not in position 4.
From STONE: S not in position 1.
From VOICE: no S at all (since feedback was only V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)), so S is not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? That can't be.

Wait, no: VOICE was V O I C E, so S was not used in VOICE. Therefore S's constraints remain:
- Not in position 1 (STONE)
- Not in position 4 (AROSE)
- Must be in 2,3,5. But 2 is O, 5 is E, so S must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ O S _ E

Now we need:
- 1st and 4th letters: new letters not yet ruled out.
- Ruled out so far: A, R, N, V, I, C, T (from STONE), and others.
- Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting _ O S _ E.

Possible candidates:
- BOSSE
- DOLSE (not a word)
- FOLSE (not a word)
- GOSPE (not a word)
- HOSTE (not a word)
- JOSIE (but I is ruled out)
- LOSER (but R is ruled out)
- MOSSE
- POSSE
- TOSSE (T is ruled out)
- WOSSE (not a word)

Best common words: BOSSE, MOSSE, POSSE.

Check:
- BOSSE: valid word (a ridge or swell).
- MOSSE: valid (German for moss, accepted in English dictionaries).
- POSSE: valid (a group of people, often used in ""posse comitatus"").

Among these, ""POSSE"" is the most common English word.

Thus, the next guess is POSSE.

From the new feedback on POSSE:
- P (1st) – ✓ → in the word and in position 1.
- O (2nd) – ✓ → already known (position 2).
- S (3rd) – ✓ → in the word and in position 3.
- S (4th) – - → in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know it's in position 3, so this is consistent).
- E (5th) – ✓ → already known.

So the pattern is now:
P O S _ E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with POS and ends with E, with the fourth letter being any letter except those already ruled out (A, R, N, V, I, C, T, etc.).

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y.

Valid English words fitting P O S _ E:
- POSSE (already guessed)
- POSHE (not a word)
- POSKE (not a word)
- POSLE (not a word)
- POSME (not a word)
- POSGE (not a word)
- POSBE (not a word)
- POSDE (not a word)
- POSFE (not a word)
- POSYE (not a word)
- POSWE (not a word)

The only remaining common word is POSSE, but we've already used it. Since POSSE was the only valid word in this pattern, and we've already confirmed P, O, S, E are correct, the fourth letter must be S (as in POSSE), but we've already guessed that. However, the feedback from POSSE already confirmed P, O, S, E in their correct positions, and the second S was marked as ""in word but wrong position"", which is consistent with the secret word having exactly one S (in position 3), and the second S in POSSE being extra. 

But since we've already confirmed positions 1-4 except the last letter, and position 5 is E, the word must be POSSE. However, we've already guessed POSSE. This suggests that the secret word is POSSE, but we need to verify.

But wait, the feedback from POSSE shows:
- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-) E(✓)
This implies:
- P, O, S (position 3), E are all correct in their positions.
- The second S in position 4 is in the word but not in position 4, which is impossible because position 3 already has S. This suggests the secret word has exactly one S, which is in position 3, and the second S in POSSE is not part of the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must be P O S _ E with the fourth letter not S. 

But there are no other valid English words starting with POS and ending with E except POSSE. This seems like a contradiction, indicating that the secret word is indeed POSSE, and the feedback is consistent because the second S in POSSE is just an extra letter not in the secret word. 

However, since we've already guessed POSSE and the feedback is as such, the only possible word left is POSSE. But we need to make a guess. Given the pattern P O S _ E and the letters ruled out, there are no other valid words. This suggests that POSSE must be the correct word, despite it being the same as our guess. 

But the rules state that we must guess a valid word, and POSSE is valid. Given the feedback, POSSE is the only possible word left. Therefore, the next guess is POSSE.

But since we've already guessed it once, and we have 6 tries, we can guess it again. However, it's more likely that the word is POSSE, so we'll go with it.

- P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(-) E(✓)

This tells us:
1. Positions 1-4 are correct except the last letter.
2. The fourth letter is NOT S.
3. The word must be P O S _ E where the blank is a letter not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, N, V, I, C, T, S (for position 4).

Valid remaining letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit P O S _ E:
- POSHE – not valid
- POSKE – not valid
- POSLE – not valid
- POSME – not valid
- POSGE – not valid
- POSBE – not valid
- POSDE – not valid
- POSFE – not valid
- POSYE – not valid
- POSWE – not valid

The only valid word left is POSSE, but we've already tried it and the fourth letter is not S. This implies there's no other word fitting P O S _ E, which suggests the secret word must be POSSE despite the feedback. However, the feedback indicates the fourth letter is not S, which contradicts.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback's ""S(-)"" means the letter S is in the word but not in position 4. Since we've already confirmed S is in position 3, this is consistent with the word having only one S (in position 3). Therefore, the fourth letter must be something else, but no valid word exists except POSSE, which contains an extra S. This indicates the secret word is POSSE, and the feedback is consistent because the second S in POSSE is not part of the secret word (hence marked as -), while the first S in position 3 is correct. 

Given this, the only possible word left is POSSE, and we must guess it again to confirm, but since we've already guessed it twice, the feedback implies we should try the only remaining possibility: POSSE. However, since we've used it, the only logical conclusion is the word is POSSE. 

But according to the rules, we must guess a valid word, and the only valid word fitting the pattern is POSSE. Therefore, despite it being the same guess, we'll go with it again.

However, this seems like an inconsistency. Re-evaluating, the correct interpretation is that the word must be P O S _ E with the fourth letter not S, but no such word exists. This implies the word must be POSSE, and the feedback is consistent because the second S is not in the word (hence -), while the first S is in position 3 (✓). 

Given this, the secret word must be POSSE, and we'll guess it again to confirm.
