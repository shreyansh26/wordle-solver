### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has a good vowel-consonant balance and uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

A good next guess is often something like ""STEAL"" or ""LEASH"" - swapping positions of the known letters and introducing new common letters.

""STEAL"" uses:
- S in position 1 (was position 4 before)
- T (common consonant)
- E in position 2 (was position 5 before)
- A in position 4 (was position 1 before)

This should help determine positions of S, E, A and test T and L.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.\n\nHowever, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. \n\nAfter considering these, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has a good vowel-consonant balance and uses letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R(x): R is not in the word at all.\n- O(x): O is not in the word at all.\n- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Does NOT contain R or O.\n- DOES contain A, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they appeared in AROSE.\n\nI need a new word that:\n1. Uses A, S, and E in different positions.\n2. Avoids R and O entirely.\n3. Uses other common consonants/vowels to narrow things down.\n\nA good next guess is often something like ""STEAL"" or ""LEASH"" - swapping positions of the known letters and introducing new common letters.\n\n""STEAL"" uses:\n- S in position 1 (was position 4 before)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E in position 2 (was position 5 before)\n- A in position 4 (was position 1 before)\n- L (common consonant)\n\nThis should help determine positions of S, E, A and test T and L.\n\n<guess>STEAL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we know:\n\nLetters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L  \nLetters that ARE in the word (but still need placement): A, S, E  \n\nPositions already ruled out:\n- A: cannot be 1st (AROSE) or 4th (STEAL)\n- S: cannot be 4th (AROSE) or 1st (STEAL)\n- E: cannot be 5th (AROSE) or 3rd (STEAL)\n\nSo the remaining valid positions for each known letter are:\n- A: 2nd, 3rd, 5th\n- S: 2nd, 3rd, 5th\n- E: 1st, 2nd, 4th\n\nWe still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowels (I, U).

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated so far):
R, O, T, L, I, C

Letters that ARE in the word (still need placement):
A, S, E   (each has been marked “-” in previous guesses)

Positions already ruled out for each of those three letters:

A: cannot be 1st (AROSE), 4th (STEAL), 3rd (NIECE)  → only 2nd or 5th left
S: cannot be 4th (AROSE), 1st (STEAL)               → only 2nd, 3rd, 5th left
E: cannot be 5th (AROSE), 3rd (STEAL), 4th (NIECE) → only 1st or 2nd left

So the word must contain A, S, E exactly once each, and the remaining two letters must be from the still-untested, high-frequency set {D, N, U, G, H, M, P, Y, …}.  
We also know:
- E must be in position 1 or 2.
- A must be in position 2 or 5.
- S must be in position 2, 3 or 5.

Let’s look for a common 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters we haven’t tried yet.

Candidate check:
- EASEL – but L is already eliminated.
- EASER – R is eliminated.
- EASY – only 4 letters.
- SPEAK – P, K new; positions: S(1) but S cannot be 1st (STEAL feedback), so no.
- EARTH – R, T eliminated.
- HASTE – H, T eliminated.
- SHADE – S(1) invalid, A(3) invalid, D new.
- SPACE – C eliminated.
- SPEAK – C eliminated.
- EAGER – R eliminated.
- EASED – D new, but E(1) allowed, A(2) allowed, S(3) allowed, E(4) invalid (NIECE ruled out 4th E), D(5) new.  
  However, duplicate E is not allowed (feedback only showed single E in word so far).

Next candidate: “PEASE”
- P new
- E(1) allowed
- A(2) allowed
- S(3) allowed
- E(4) invalid (already ruled out 4th E)

Still invalid.

Next: “HEAVE”
- H new
- E(1) allowed
- A(2) allowed
- V new
- E(4) invalid

No.

Next: “MEANS”
- M new
- E(1) allowed
- A(2) allowed
- N new
- S(5) allowed

This uses:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- A in 2nd (allowed)
- S in 5th (allowed)
- M, N new letters not yet tested.

“MEANS” is a valid common word that fits all constraints.
