### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"", which contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This should give us good coverage to start eliminating possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (wrong in position 1 and 3)
- S (wrong in position 4 and 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
R, O, E, T, N, D

So far the word must contain A and S, and cannot contain R O E T N D.

Positions we have ruled out for each letter:
A: not 1, not 3 → possible positions 2, 4, 5
S: not 1, not 4 → possible positions 2, 3, 5

We still need to test other common letters that have not appeared: L, I, C, U, G, B, M, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A and S in still-allowed positions
2. Introduce several new common letters
3. Avoid any of the excluded letters

Candidate word: SLACK
- S in position 1 → allowed (only ruled out 1 and 4, but 1 is allowed for S if we consider the feedback says ""wrong position"" not ""excluded"")
Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- R, O, E are not in the word

Guess 2: STAND → S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)

- S is in the word but not in position 1

- S is in word, positions allowed: 2, 3, 5
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, T, N, D

Possible word: SCUBA

Wait, let's think of a word with:
- A in position 2

Word: BASIL
- B (new), A in 2, S in 3, I (new), L (new)
This uses A in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces B, I, L which are common and untested.

- Letters in the word: A (position 2), S.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, B, I, L.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 3, 4 → S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is already taken by A, so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word looks like: _ A _ _ S.

We still need two more letters that:
1. Have not been tested yet (from the remaining common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
2. Are not in the excluded list.

A good strategy is to pick two new common letters and test them in positions 1 and 3 (position 4 is open but we only need two letters).

Let's try: CAVAS – but V is okay, but A is in position 2.
But CAVAS is not a common word.

Another approach: since we need _ A _ _ S and we have letters C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y left, let's pick common ones.

But this has A in position 4 which is allowed, and S in position 5 which is allowed. But this uses M twice which might not be optimal.

Another valid word: PAPAS – P A P A S. But P is okay, A is in position 2, P is okay, A is in position 4, S in position 5. This uses P twice.

Let's try: CAVAS – C A V A S. But C is okay, V is okay, A is in position 2, A is in position 4, S in position 5. CAVAS is valid (though rare).

But let's think of more common words: PANSY – N excluded.

But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters: P A _ _ S.

Let's check: PACKS
- P: new, okay
- A: position 2, correct
- C: new, okay

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"", which contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This should give us good coverage to start eliminating possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

We still have no information about positions 2, 3, 5, or the letters T, L, N, I, D, etc. To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
1. Uses A and S in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, E.

A good candidate is ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position, since it was in position 4 before).
- T, N, D are new common letters.
- A is in position 3 (new position, since it was in position 1 before).
- No R, O, E are used.

This should give us good coverage.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (wrong in position 1 and 3)
- S (wrong in position 4 and 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
R, O, E, T, N, D

So far the word must contain A and S, and cannot contain R O E T N D.

Positions we have ruled out for each letter:
A: not 1, not 3 → possible positions 2, 4, 5
S: not 1, not 4 → possible positions 2, 3, 5

We still need to test other common letters that have not appeared: L, I, C, U, G, B, M, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A and S in still-allowed positions
2. Introduce several new common letters
3. Avoid any of the excluded letters

Candidate word: SLACK
- S in position 1 → allowed (only ruled out 1 and 4, but 1 is allowed for S if we consider the feedback says ""wrong position"" not ""excluded"")
Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- R, O, E are not in the word

Guess 2: STAND → S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T, N, D are not in the word

So combined:
- A is in word, positions allowed: 2, 4, 5
- S is in word, positions allowed: 2, 3, 5
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, T, N, D

Now let's choose a word that uses A and S in allowed positions and introduces new common letters.

Possible word: SCUBA
But this uses U and B which are less common, and C is okay.

Wait, let's think of a word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3
- And new common letters for other positions

Word: BASIL
- B (new), A in 2, S in 3, I (new), L (new)
This uses A in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces B, I, L which are common and untested.

This seems like a good choice.

Remaining common letters to test in positions 1 and 3 (and position 4 if needed) are: F, G, H, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ S with no excluded letters.

Let's list possible candidates:

- G A _ _ S: GAMES (M, E – E excluded), GAVES (E excluded), GAINS (N excluded).
- H A _ _ S: HASTE (E excluded), HALES (L excluded), HAPPY (doesn't end with S).
- M A _ _ S: MACHO (O excluded), MAMAS (M, A, S – A is fixed, S is fixed, M is okay), MAMAS is valid but uses M twice.
- U A _ _ S: No common words start with U here.
- V A _ _ S: VAPED (but P, D excluded), VAMPS (P excluded).
- W A _ _ S: WACKS (C excluded), WADS (too short).
- Y A _ _ S: YACHTS (too long), YAWLS (L excluded).

The most plausible valid word fitting the pattern is MAMAS:
- M in position 1 (new), A in position 2 (correct), M in position 3 (repeats M), A in position 4 (new position for A, allowed), S in position 5 (correct).
However, this repeats M and may not be optimal.

Another candidate: GAVES – but E is excluded.
Another candidate: HAMPS – but P is excluded.
Another candidate: VAMPS – P is excluded.

Looking again, the only valid word left seems to be MAMAS, but let's check if we missed any.

Wait, let's try: FAMAS – but F, A, M, A, S. F is new, M is new, A is correct, S is correct. FAMAS is a valid word (though rare, it's a name or ""fame"").

But let's see if there's a more common word: MAMAS is the only other.

Given the constraints, MAMAS is the best choice.

But let's double-check:
- M A M A S
- M: position 1 (new), allowed
- A: position 2 (correct)
- M: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This uses only allowed letters and fits the pattern.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"", which contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This should give us good coverage to start eliminating possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not R, O, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

We still have no information about positions 2, 3, 5, or the letters T, L, N, I, D, etc. To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
1. Uses A and S in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters not yet tested (like T, L, N, I, D, U, etc.).
3. Avoids R, O, E.

A good candidate is ""STAND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position, since it was in position 4 before).
- T, N, D are new common letters.
- A is in position 3 (new position, since it was in position 1 before).
- No R, O, E are used.

This should give us good coverage.

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word:
- A (wrong in position 1 and 3)
- S (wrong in position 4 and 1)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
R, O, E, T, N, D

So far the word must contain A and S, and cannot contain R O E T N D.

Positions we have ruled out for each letter:
A: not 1, not 3 → possible positions 2, 4, 5
S: not 1, not 4 → possible positions 2, 3, 5

We still need to test other common letters that have not appeared: L, I, C, U, G, B, M, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A and S in still-allowed positions
2. Introduce several new common letters
3. Avoid any of the excluded letters

Candidate word: SLACK
- S in position 1 → allowed (only ruled out 1 and 4, but 1 is allowed for S if we consider the feedback says ""wrong position"" not ""excluded"")
Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- R, O, E are not in the word

Guess 2: STAND → S(-) T(x) A(-) N(x) D(x)
This means:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T, N, D are not in the word

So combined:
- A is in word, positions allowed: 2, 4, 5
- S is in word, positions allowed: 2, 3, 5
- Letters excluded: R, O, E, T, N, D

Now let's choose a word that uses A and S in allowed positions and introduces new common letters.

Possible word: SCUBA
But this uses U and B which are less common, and C is okay.

Wait, let's think of a word with:
- A in position 2
- S in position 3
- And new common letters for other positions

Word: BASIL
- B (new), A in 2, S in 3, I (new), L (new)
This uses A in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 3 (allowed), and introduces B, I, L which are common and untested.

This seems like a good choice.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: BASIL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) S(-) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BASIL:
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and is now locked into position 2.
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (in addition to not being in positions 1 or 4).
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (position 2), S.
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, B, I, L.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1, 3, 4 → S must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is already taken by A, so S must be in position 5.

Therefore the word looks like: _ A _ _ S.

We still need two more letters that:
1. Have not been tested yet (from the remaining common letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).
2. Are not in the excluded list.

A good strategy is to pick two new common letters and test them in positions 1 and 3 (position 4 is open but we only need two letters).

Candidate word: MACHS – but ""MACHS"" is not a valid English word.
Next candidate: HAKES – but E is excluded.
Next candidate: GAMS – but this is only 4 letters.
Next candidate: PANS – but N is excluded.
Next candidate: CASH – but we need 5 letters and H is okay.

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words ending in S with A in position 2 and no excluded letters.

Valid words: 
- CAVES – but E is excluded.
- CAGES – but E is excluded.
- MACHO – but O is excluded.
- PAPAS – but P is okay, but A is already in position 2.
- GASP – too short.
- HASTE – E excluded.
- KAYAK – but K is okay, but A is in position 2.
- PANSY – but N is excluded.
- PAPAL – but L is excluded.

Let's try: CAVAS – but V is okay, but A is in position 2.
But CAVAS is not a common word.

Another approach: since we need _ A _ _ S and we have letters C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y left, let's pick common ones.

Valid word: CASHS – no.
Valid word: PAPAS – but P is okay, but A is in position 2.
Valid word: MACHS – no.
Valid word: KAYAK – but K is okay, and A is in position 2, and Y is okay, but K is in position 1 and 5, but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let's try: MACHO – but O is excluded.
Let's try: PANSY – but N is excluded.
Let's try: GASP – too short.

Actually, let's try: CAVAS – but this is not a common word.
Let's try: HAKKS – no.
Let's try: MAMAS – but M is okay, A is in position 2, M is okay, A is in position 4, but A can be in position 4 (since A is allowed in 2,4,5). But S is in position 5. So MAMAS: M A M A S. But this has A in position 4 which is allowed, and S in position 5 which is allowed. But this uses M twice which might not be optimal.

But MAMAS is a valid word. However, let's see if we can find a better one.

Another valid word: PAPAS – P A P A S. But P is okay, A is in position 2, P is okay, A is in position 4, S in position 5. This uses P twice.

Let's try: CAVAS – C A V A S. But C is okay, V is okay, A is in position 2, A is in position 4, S in position 5. CAVAS is valid (though rare).

But let's think of more common words: PANSY – N excluded.
Let's try: PAPAS – this is more common.

But let's see if we can find a word with distinct letters: P A _ _ S.

Possible: P A C K S – but PACKS is a valid word (meaning to pack repeatedly), and uses C and K which are new.

Let's check: PACKS
- P: new, okay
- A: position 2, correct
- C: new, okay
- K: new, okay
- S: position 5, correct (since S must be in 5)

This seems optimal.

Remaining common letters to test in positions 1 and 3 (and position 4 if needed) are: F, G, H, M, U, V, W, Y.

However, this repeats M and may not be optimal.

- A: position 2 (correct)
- M: position 3 (new position, allowed)
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This uses only allowed letters and fits the pattern.

From the new feedback on MAMAS:

- A(✓) → A is confirmed in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is confirmed in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is confirmed in position 5.

So the word pattern is now: _ A _ A S, and we already know:
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, T, N, D, B, I, L, P, C, K, M.
- Remaining possible letters for position 1 and 3: F, G, H, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A _ A S with no excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- F A _ A S: FABLES (L excluded), FAVAS (V, S – but S is fixed at 5), FAKAS (K excluded).
- G A _ A S: GAVAS (V, S – S is fixed), GAZAS (Z not common, but GAZAS is valid), but Z is uncommon.
- H A _ A S: HAZAS (Z uncommon), HAPPY (doesn't fit).
- U A _ A S: No common words.
- V A _ A S: VAPAS (P excluded).
- W A _ A S: WAKAS (K excluded).
- Y A _ A S: YACAS (C excluded).

The only valid word left seems to be GAZAS:
- G in position 1 (new), A in 2 (correct), Z in 3 (but Z is uncommon), A in 4 (correct), S in 5 (correct).
However, Z is not in the excluded list, but GAZAS is valid.

But let's check if we missed any:
- F A V A S: FAVAS is valid (a type of bread), uses F, V which are new.
- F A V A S: F(1), A(2), V(3), A(4), S(5) – all letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

FAVAS is a valid word (though rare) and uses new letters F and V.

But let's see if there's a more common word: GAZAS is the only other plausible one, but GAZAS uses Z which is less common.

Between FAVAS and GAZAS, FAVAS is more likely.

But wait, let's confirm FAVAS:
- F: new, allowed
- A: position 2 (correct)
- V: new, allowed
- A: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This fits perfectly.
