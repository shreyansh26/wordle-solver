For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word often includes a mix of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends with E.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc. We already know the last letter is E, so we want to test new consonants and a vowel in the first four positions.

A good next guess would be something like:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) — tests C, R, O, N while keeping E in place.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) — similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) — tests C, H, O, R.

Among these, CRONE seems strong as it tests C, R, O, N — all common letters not yet eliminated.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, N.
3. O is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” in CRONE).

So we need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (but not in the 3rd spot) and avoids all the eliminated letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already partially used).

A good next probe should test new consonants and possibly the vowel I or U, while placing O in a different position.

Candidate words:
- HOMIE (but M and I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  
- POISE (but S is eliminated)  
- DOPEY (but Y is allowed, and we haven’t tested D or P)  
- GLOVE (but L is eliminated)  
- BOGIE (B, G, I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  

“BOGIE” looks solid:  
- Ends in E (confirmed).  
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the “-” feedback).  
- Uses new letters B, O, G, I, E — none of which have been ruled out except O (already known to be in the word).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word often includes a mix of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends with E.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc. We already know the last letter is E, so we want to test new consonants and a vowel in the first four positions.

A good next guess would be something like:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) — tests C, R, O, N while keeping E in place.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) — similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) — tests C, H, O, R.

Among these, CRONE seems strong as it tests C, R, O, N — all common letters not yet eliminated.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, N.
3. O is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” in CRONE).

So we need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (but not in the 3rd spot) and avoids all the eliminated letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already partially used).

A good next probe should test new consonants and possibly the vowel I or U, while placing O in a different position.

Candidate words:
- HOMIE (but M and I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  
- POISE (but S is eliminated)  
- DOPEY (but Y is allowed, and we haven’t tested D or P)  
- GLOVE (but L is eliminated)  
- BOGIE (B, G, I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  

“BOGIE” looks solid:  
- Ends in E (confirmed).  
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the “-” feedback).  
- Uses new letters B, O, G, I, E — none of which have been ruled out except O (already known to be in the word).

Therefore, BOGIE is a strong third guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word often includes a mix of these letters. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (✓) — so the word ends with E.

Since S, L, A, T are eliminated, we need a new set of consonants and vowels. The remaining common letters include R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc. We already know the last letter is E, so we want to test new consonants and a vowel in the first four positions.

A good next guess would be something like:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) — tests C, R, O, N while keeping E in place.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) — similar to CRONE but with P.
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) — tests C, H, O, R.

Among these, CRONE seems strong as it tests C, R, O, N — all common letters not yet eliminated.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, N.
3. O is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” in CRONE).

So we need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O (but not in the 3rd spot) and avoids all the eliminated letters.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already partially used).

A good next probe should test new consonants and possibly the vowel I or U, while placing O in a different position.

Candidate words:
- HOMIE (but M and I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  
- POISE (but S is eliminated)  
- DOPEY (but Y is allowed, and we haven’t tested D or P)  
- GLOVE (but L is eliminated)  
- BOGIE (B, G, I are still allowed; O is in position 2)  

“BOGIE” looks solid:  
- Ends in E (confirmed).  
- Contains O in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the “-” feedback).  
- Uses new letters B, O, G, I, E — none of which have been ruled out except O (already known to be in the word).

Therefore, BOGIE is a strong third guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: BOGIE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) G(x) I(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on BOGIE:
- B is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so O is now fixed in position 2.
- G is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so I is fixed in position 4.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so E is fixed in position 5.

So the word pattern is now: _ O _ I E

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, B, G.

Remaining letters we haven’t tested yet (common ones): D, F, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ O _ I E. Let’s think of possible words:

- DOUIE – but ""DOUIE"" isn’t a valid English word.
- FOUIE – invalid.
- HOUIE – invalid.
- KOUIE – invalid.
- MOUIE – invalid.
- POUIE – invalid.
- WOUIE – invalid.
- YOUIE – invalid.

Looking at valid English words, the only common one that fits _ O _ I E is “DOIE?” – nothing. Wait, let me think differently.

Actually, let me list valid 5-letter words ending in OIE: there aren’t many. The only common one is “HOIST” but that doesn’t fit. Wait, let me think of words with O in position 2, I in position 4, E in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- FOUL E – but that’s not 5 letters.
- HOMIE – but M is allowed, but I is already in position 4, E in 5, but O is in position 2, so HOMIE would be H O M I E – yes, that fits the pattern _ O _ I E.

Check letters in HOMIE:
- H – not eliminated.
- O – confirmed in position 2.
- M – not eliminated.
- I – confirmed in position 4.
- E – confirmed in position 5.

So HOMIE is a valid word that fits all constraints.

Current known pattern: _ O _ I E  
Positions fixed:
- 2 = O  
- 4 = I  
- 5 = E  

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, B, G, H, M.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ I E using only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining consonants to try: D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Valid English words fitting _ O _ I E:
- DOUIE – invalid
- FOUIE – invalid
- KOUIE – invalid
- POUIE – invalid
- WOUIE – invalid
- YOUIE – invalid

Wait, let me check another angle. The only common valid word that fits is “DOIE?” – nothing. Actually, the word “DOIE” isn’t valid. 

Let me think of all possible valid 5-letter words ending in OIE: there aren’t many. The only one I can find is “HOIST” which doesn’t fit. 

Wait, let me list all possible combinations with remaining letters:

Possible first letters (not eliminated): D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible third letters (not eliminated): D, F, K, P, U, V, W, Y (since M, N, etc. are out).

So possible words:
- D O D I E – “DODIE” – valid (a name, also used as a term)
- F O D I E – “FODIE” – not a word
- K O D I E – “KODIE” – not a word
- P O D I E – “PODIE” – not a word
- U O D I E – “UODIE” – not a word
- V O D I E – “VODIE” – not a word
- W O D I E – “WODIE” – not a word
- Y O D I E – “YODIE” – not a word

“DODIE” seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

Let me verify:
- D – not eliminated
- O – correct position
- D – not eliminated
- I – correct position
- E – correct position

Thus, DODIE is the logical next guess.

From the latest feedback on DODIE:
- D is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 1 is D.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 2 is O.
- D is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so there is another D somewhere, but not in position 3.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 4 is I.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so position 5 is E.

Therefore, the word must be D O _ I E, and the third letter must be a D (since the only D left is in position 3, but feedback says it's in wrong position, which is impossible because position 3 is the only place D could be. Wait, this suggests an inconsistency, but actually the feedback means the second D in DODIE (position 3) is marked (-), implying there's another D elsewhere. However, positions 1,2,4,5 are fixed as D,O,I,E. The only remaining position is 3, but it's marked (-), meaning no D there. This implies no D exists in the word, contradicting the first D's ✓. This suggests the word must be D O D I E, but the third D is marked (-), which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible word fitting D O _ I E is DOIE with an additional letter, but we need 5 letters. Realizing the only valid word is DOGIE, but G was eliminated. Next possibility is DOZIE, but Z isn't tested. However, the only common valid word is DOGIE (but G is out), so this suggests the word must be DOZIE or similar, but Z isn't in our allowed letters. Rechecking, the only valid word left is DOZIE, but since Z isn't tested and G is out, this indicates the word must be DOZIE. However, since we have 6 tries and this is the 5th, we must guess DOZIE.
