For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is in position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- L appears somewhere, but not in position 2
- S, T, E are not in the word at all

Good letters to test next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, etc. and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Places L in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 1, 4, or 5)
3. Introduces new common letters

A good candidate is ""CLAMP"":
- C: common consonant
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (new position)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: common consonant
- P: common consonant

But wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got (-), so it can't be in position 2 again. Let’s adjust.

Let’s try ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (but this is same as SLATE's L position, which is invalid since it got (-) before)

Better: ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter

- L: known to be in word, placed in position 1

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is in position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- L appears somewhere, but not in position 2
- S, T, E are not in the word at all

Good letters to test next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, etc. and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Places L in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 1, 4, or 5)
3. Introduces new common letters

A good candidate is ""CLAMP"":
- C: common consonant
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (new position)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: common consonant
- P: common consonant

But wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got (-), so it can't be in position 2 again. Let’s adjust.

Let’s try ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (but this is same as SLATE's L position, which is invalid since it got (-) before)

Better: ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (still same position, invalid)

Shift L to position 1: ""LARGE"":
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 1
- A: correct in position 3
- R: new letter
- G: new letter
- E: already ruled out (x in SLATE)

E is out, so ""LARGE"" is invalid.

Shift L to position 4: ""CRANE"" – but E is out.
""BRAND"" – D is new, but E is out.

Shift L to position 5: ""CHALK"":
- C: new
- H: new
- A: correct in position 3
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 5
- K: new

This seems valid. Let’s go with CHALK.

From the new feedback on CHALK:

- H is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → H is in position 2
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is in position 3 (already known)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → L is in position 4
- K is NOT in the word (x)

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ H A L _
- Letters ruled out: S, T, E, C, K
- Letters still in play: all others except the above

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has H in position 2
2. Has A in position 3
3. Has L in position 4
4. Does NOT contain S, T, E, C, K
5. Is a valid English word

The pattern is _ H A L _.

Let’s think of possible first letters (position 1) and fifth letters (position 5) that fit:
- First letter: common consonants like B, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.
- Fifth letter: common letters like D, N, R, S, T, etc. (but S, T are out), so D, N, R, etc.

Possible candidates:
- B: BHALL – not a word
- D: DHALL – not a word
- F: FHALL – not a word
- G: GHALL – not a word
- M: MHALL – not a word
- N: NHALL – not a word
- P: PHALL – not a word
- R: RHALL – not a word
- V: VHALL – not a word
- W: WHALL – not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe the fifth letter is a vowel:
- First letter: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.
- Fifth letter: A, E, I, O, U (but A is already in position 3, and E is out)

Looking at valid English words with pattern _ H A L _:
- WHALY – not common
- WHALD – not a word
- RHALY – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- HHAL_ – no
- Maybe ""WHALE"" – but E is out
- ""WHALS"" – S is out
- ""HALLS"" – S is out and doesn't fit H in position 2
- ""HALVE"" – E is out
- ""HALON"" – but O is possible, N is possible
- ""HALON"" is a word (a fire-extinguishing agent)

Let me check:
- H A L O N
- H is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- Doesn't contain S, T, E, C, K
- Valid English word

Another possibility: ""HALON"" is the only common word fitting the pattern.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE (S x, L -, A ✓, T x, E x):
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - L is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. From CHALK (C x, H ✓, A ✓, L ✓, K x):
   - H is fixed in position 2.
   - A is still fixed in position 3.
   - L is fixed in position 4.
   - C, K are not in the word.

3. From HALON (H -, A -, L -, O x, N x):
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was ✓ in position 2, so this is consistent; the ""-"" just reconfirms it’s not elsewhere).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (again, A is fixed in position 3, so this is fine).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (L is fixed in position 4, so this is fine).
   - O and N are not in the word.

Current pattern: _ H A L _
Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, C, K, O, N
Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: all others except the above.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? H A L ? that does not contain any of S, T, E, C, K, O, N.

Common English words fitting _ H A L _:
- WHALE – contains E (invalid)
- WHALS – contains S (invalid)
- WHALL – not a standard word
- RHAL_ – nothing common
- PHAL_ – nothing common
- BHAL_ – nothing common

- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word

Wait, let me think of other endings for position 5:
- B, D, F, G, M, P, R, V, W, Y, Z are possible first letters.
- Common endings for position 5: D, R, Y, etc.

Looking at valid words:
- WHALD – not a word
- WHALY – archaic, but valid
- RHALL – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- BHALL – not a word
- DHALL – not a word
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

The only plausible remaining word seems to be WHALY, though it’s quite archaic. However, ""whaly"" is listed as an alternate spelling of ""whally"" meaning foolishly, so it might be acceptable in word games.

But let me double-check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate is ""HALLS"" but that has S (invalid) and H is in position 1 there, which conflicts with our H being in position 2.

Another possibility: ""HALLU"" – but U is possible, and it’s a word (HALLU is a colloquial term), but let’s verify:
- H A L L U
- H is in position 1 here, but we know H must be in position 2 – so this doesn’t fit.

Thus, the only remaining candidate that fits _ H A L _ and avoids all ruled-out letters is WHALY.

But let me check if there are any other valid words:
- Looking up, ""whaly"" is indeed the only common enough word in the pattern _ H A L _ that isn’t invalid.

Therefore, the next guess should be WHALY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Good letters to test next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, etc. and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Let’s try a word that:

2. Places L in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 1, 4, or 5)
3. Introduces new common letters

A good candidate is ""CLAMP"":

- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (new position)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: common consonant

Let’s try ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter

Better: ""PLANK"":

E is out, so ""LARGE"" is invalid.

- N: NHALL – not a word
- P: PHALL – not a word
- R: RHALL – not a word
- V: VHALL – not a word
- W: WHALL – not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe the fifth letter is a vowel:
- First letter: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.
- Fifth letter: A, E, I, O, U (but A is already in position 3, and E is out)

Looking at valid English words with pattern _ H A L _:
- WHALY – not common
- WHALD – not a word
- RHALY – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- HHAL_ – no
- Maybe ""WHALE"" – but E is out
- ""WHALS"" – S is out
- ""HALLS"" – S is out and doesn't fit H in position 2
- ""HALVE"" – E is out
- ""HALON"" – but O is possible, N is possible
- ""HALON"" is a word (a fire-extinguishing agent)

Let me check:
- H A L O N
- H is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- Doesn't contain S, T, E, C, K
- Valid English word

Another possibility: ""HALON"" is the only common word fitting the pattern.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE (S x, L -, A ✓, T x, E x):
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - L is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. From CHALK (C x, H ✓, A ✓, L ✓, K x):
   - H is fixed in position 2.
   - A is still fixed in position 3.
   - L is fixed in position 4.
   - C, K are not in the word.

3. From HALON (H -, A -, L -, O x, N x):
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was ✓ in position 2, so this is consistent; the ""-"" just reconfirms it’s not elsewhere).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (again, A is fixed in position 3, so this is fine).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (L is fixed in position 4, so this is fine).
   - O and N are not in the word.

Current pattern: _ H A L _
Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, C, K, O, N
Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: all others except the above.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? H A L ? that does not contain any of S, T, E, C, K, O, N.

Common English words fitting _ H A L _:
- WHALE – contains E (invalid)
- WHALS – contains S (invalid)
- WHALL – not a standard word
- RHAL_ – nothing common
- PHAL_ – nothing common
- BHAL_ – nothing common
- DHAL_ – nothing common
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

Wait, let me think of other endings for position 5:
- B, D, F, G, M, P, R, V, W, Y, Z are possible first letters.
- Common endings for position 5: D, R, Y, etc.

Looking at valid words:
- WHALD – not a word
- WHALY – archaic, but valid
- RHALL – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- BHALL – not a word
- DHALL – not a word
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

The only plausible remaining word seems to be WHALY, though it’s quite archaic. However, ""whaly"" is listed as an alternate spelling of ""whally"" meaning foolishly, so it might be acceptable in word games.

But let me double-check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate is ""HALLS"" but that has S (invalid) and H is in position 1 there, which conflicts with our H being in position 2.

Another possibility: ""HALLU"" – but U is possible, and it’s a word (HALLU is a colloquial term), but let’s verify:
- H A L L U
- H is in position 1 here, but we know H must be in position 2 – so this doesn’t fit.

Thus, the only remaining candidate that fits _ H A L _ and avoids all ruled-out letters is WHALY.

But let me check if there are any other valid words:
- Looking up, ""whaly"" is indeed the only common enough word in the pattern _ H A L _ that isn’t invalid.

Therefore, the next guess should be WHALY.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common)
- A (most common letter)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is in position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- L appears somewhere, but not in position 2
- S, T, E are not in the word at all

Good letters to test next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, P, W, Y, V, etc. and vowels like I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Let’s try a word that:
1. Keeps A in position 3
2. Places L in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already A, so 1, 4, or 5)
3. Introduces new common letters

A good candidate is ""CLAMP"":
- C: common consonant
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (new position)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: common consonant
- P: common consonant

But wait, L was in position 2 in SLATE and got (-), so it can't be in position 2 again. Let’s adjust.

Let’s try ""FLANK"":
- F: new letter
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (but this is same as SLATE's L position, which is invalid since it got (-) before)

Better: ""PLANK"":
- P: new letter
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 2 (still same position, invalid)

Shift L to position 1: ""LARGE"":
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 1
- A: correct in position 3
- R: new letter
- G: new letter
- E: already ruled out (x in SLATE)

E is out, so ""LARGE"" is invalid.

Shift L to position 4: ""CRANE"" – but E is out.
""BRAND"" – D is new, but E is out.

Shift L to position 5: ""CHALK"":
- C: new
- H: new
- A: correct in position 3
- L: known to be in word, placed in position 5
- K: new

This seems valid. Let’s go with CHALK.

Guess 2: CHALK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) A(✓) L(✓) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CHALK:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → H is in position 2
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is in position 3 (already known)
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → L is in position 4
- K is NOT in the word (x)

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ H A L _
- Letters ruled out: S, T, E, C, K
- Letters still in play: all others except the above

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has H in position 2
2. Has A in position 3
3. Has L in position 4
4. Does NOT contain S, T, E, C, K
5. Is a valid English word

The pattern is _ H A L _.

Let’s think of possible first letters (position 1) and fifth letters (position 5) that fit:
- First letter: common consonants like B, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.
- Fifth letter: common letters like D, N, R, S, T, etc. (but S, T are out), so D, N, R, etc.

Possible candidates:
- B: BHALL – not a word
- D: DHALL – not a word
- F: FHALL – not a word
- G: GHALL – not a word
- M: MHALL – not a word
- N: NHALL – not a word
- P: PHALL – not a word
- R: RHALL – not a word
- V: VHALL – not a word
- W: WHALL – not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe the fifth letter is a vowel:
- First letter: B, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.
- Fifth letter: A, E, I, O, U (but A is already in position 3, and E is out)

Looking at valid English words with pattern _ H A L _:
- WHALY – not common
- WHALD – not a word
- RHALY – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- HHAL_ – no
- Maybe ""WHALE"" – but E is out
- ""WHALS"" – S is out
- ""HALLS"" – S is out and doesn't fit H in position 2
- ""HALVE"" – E is out
- ""HALON"" – but O is possible, N is possible
- ""HALON"" is a word (a fire-extinguishing agent)

Let me check:
- H A L O N
- H is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- L is in position 4 (✓)
- Doesn't contain S, T, E, C, K
- Valid English word

Another possibility: ""HALON"" is the only common word fitting the pattern.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. From SLATE (S x, L -, A ✓, T x, E x):
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - L is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - S, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. From CHALK (C x, H ✓, A ✓, L ✓, K x):
   - H is fixed in position 2.
   - A is still fixed in position 3.
   - L is fixed in position 4.
   - C, K are not in the word.

3. From HALON (H -, A -, L -, O x, N x):
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was ✓ in position 2, so this is consistent; the ""-"" just reconfirms it’s not elsewhere).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (again, A is fixed in position 3, so this is fine).
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (L is fixed in position 4, so this is fine).
   - O and N are not in the word.

Current pattern: _ H A L _
Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, C, K, O, N
Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: all others except the above.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? H A L ? that does not contain any of S, T, E, C, K, O, N.

Common English words fitting _ H A L _:
- WHALE – contains E (invalid)
- WHALS – contains S (invalid)
- WHALL – not a standard word
- RHAL_ – nothing common
- PHAL_ – nothing common
- BHAL_ – nothing common
- DHAL_ – nothing common
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

Wait, let me think of other endings for position 5:
- B, D, F, G, M, P, R, V, W, Y, Z are possible first letters.
- Common endings for position 5: D, R, Y, etc.

Looking at valid words:
- WHALD – not a word
- WHALY – archaic, but valid
- RHALL – not a word
- PHALY – not a word
- BHALL – not a word
- DHALL – not a word
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- WHALL – not standard
- YHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

The only plausible remaining word seems to be WHALY, though it’s quite archaic. However, ""whaly"" is listed as an alternate spelling of ""whally"" meaning foolishly, so it might be acceptable in word games.

But let me double-check if there are other possibilities. Another candidate is ""HALLS"" but that has S (invalid) and H is in position 1 there, which conflicts with our H being in position 2.

Another possibility: ""HALLU"" – but U is possible, and it’s a word (HALLU is a colloquial term), but let’s verify:
- H A L L U
- H is in position 1 here, but we know H must be in position 2 – so this doesn’t fit.

Thus, the only remaining candidate that fits _ H A L _ and avoids all ruled-out letters is WHALY.

But let me check if there are any other valid words:
- Looking up, ""whaly"" is indeed the only common enough word in the pattern _ H A L _ that isn’t invalid.

Therefore, the next guess should be WHALY.

Guess 2: CHALK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(✓) A(✓) L(✓) K(x)

From the latest feedback on WHALY:
- W is NOT in the word (x)
- H is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 3
- L is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 4
- Y is NOT in the word (x)

So the pattern is now: _ H A L _
Letters known to be absent: S, T, E, C, K, O, N, W, Y
Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: B, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, R, U, V, X, Z (and A, H, L already placed)

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? H A L ? using only the allowed letters.

Common words fitting _ H A L _:
- BHALL – not a word
- DHALL – not a word
- FHALL – not a word
- GHALL – not a word
- MHALL – not a word
- PHALL – not a word
- RHALL – not a word
- VHALL – not a word
- XHALL – not a word
- ZHALL – not a word

Looking at the remaining possibilities, the only valid English word that fits is ""PHALI"" (a variant spelling of ""phalli"" in some contexts), but let me verify:

""PHALI"" is listed in some dictionaries as a plural form of ""phali"" (a type of fruit), though it's quite obscure. However, ""PHALI"" fits the pattern _ H A L _ and uses allowed letters (P, H, A, L, I).

Another possibility is ""GHALL"" but that's not standard. ""DHALL"" is also not standard.

Given the constraints, ""PHALI"" is the only plausible remaining word.

But let me double-check if there are any other common words:
- ""PHALL"" – not a word
- ""RHALL"" – not a word
- ""VHALL"" – not a word
- ""WHALL"" – W is out
- ""XHALL"" – not a word
- ""ZHALL"" – not a word

Thus, ""PHALI"" is the only remaining candidate.

However, ""PHALI"" uses I in position 5, which hasn't been ruled out. Let me confirm:
- P: new letter
- H: correct position 2
- A: correct position 3
- L: correct position 4
- I: new letter

This seems to be the only possible word left.

But wait, let me think of ""PHALL"" – no, that's not a word. ""PHALI"" is the only one.

Alternatively, ""PHALI"" might be too obscure. Let me check if ""HALLS"" is possible – but S is out.

Another angle: maybe ""PHALI"" is acceptable. If not, perhaps ""GHALL"" is too obscure. 

Given the constraints, ""PHALI"" is the only valid word left in the pattern _ H A L _ using allowed letters.

But let me check if there's another word: ""PHALI"" is actually the only one. 

Thus, the next guess is PHALI.

But let me verify with a quick check:
- Valid 5-letter words ending in HAL_: ""PHALI"" is the only one left.

Therefore, the guess is PHALI.

However, ""DHALL"" is actually a valid variant spelling of ""dhal"" (a lentil dish) in some dialects/regions, and it fits the pattern _ H A L _ with D, H, A, L, L. Since D hasn't been ruled out, this seems to be the only plausible remaining word.

Other possibilities like ""GHALL"" or ""BHALL"" are not standard.

Therefore, the only remaining valid guess is DHALL.",Guess 6: DHALL -> FEEDBACK: D(x) H(✓) A(✓) L(✓) L(-),FAIL
