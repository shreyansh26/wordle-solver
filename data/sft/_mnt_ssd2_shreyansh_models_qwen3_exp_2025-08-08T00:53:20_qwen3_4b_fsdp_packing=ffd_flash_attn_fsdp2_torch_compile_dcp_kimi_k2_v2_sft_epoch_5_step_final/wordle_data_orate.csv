### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (exactly)
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (exactly)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters we still need to place: A and O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (since they can’t be where they were).
- Letters to avoid: S
- We can try a word that keeps R and E fixed, places A and O in new valid spots, and introduces a new common consonant.

A good candidate is “RANGE”:
- R in position 2 ✓
- E in position 5 ✓
- A in position 1 (new spot for A)
- N is a new common consonant
- G is another new common consonant

This gives us three fresh letters (N, G) plus A and O are repositioned.

Let's update what we know after the two guesses.

   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is NOT in the word.

2. From RANGE:
   - R is NOT in position 1 (but we already know it's in position 2, so this is consistent).
   - A is NOT in position 2 (but we already know it's not in position 1, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - N is NOT in the word.

   - E is in position 5 (consistent with AROSE).

- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters we know must appear: A and O
- Letters we know must NOT appear: S, N, G
- Positions A and O can't be:
   - A: not 1, not 2
   - O: not 3

Possible positions:
- A can be in 3, 4
- O can be in 1, 2, 4 (but can't overlap with A)

- Uses A and O in the remaining valid spots
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, N, G)

From the new feedback on ROATE:
- R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  (already knew it’s in position 2, so fine)
- O(-)  → O is in the word but NOT in position 2
- A(✓)  → A is in position 3
- T(✓)  → T is in position 4
- E(✓)  → E is in position 5

So the pattern is now locked in as:
_  R  A  T  E

Only the first letter is unknown.
We also know:
- Letters already placed: R, A, T, E
- Letters ruled out: S, N, G, and now also positions 1 for A, 2 for O, 3 for O (but O still needs to appear somewhere else)
Wait—let’s re-list everything carefully.

Known facts:
1. Word length = 5.
2. Pattern: ? R A T E
3. Letters that must appear: A, R, T, E (and O must appear somewhere because earlier feedback said O is in the word but never in position 3).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, N, G.

But the pattern ? R A T E already contains four letters (R, A, T, E) and we know O must appear.  
That means the only remaining position for O is the first letter, because positions 2-5 are filled with R, A, T, E.  
Therefore the word must be O R A T E.

Let’s verify:
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since earlier feedback only said O is not in position 3).
- R in 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5 all match ✓.
- No S, N, or G appear, which is consistent with earlier eliminations.
