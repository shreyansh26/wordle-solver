### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.

Another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help identify vowel positions early.

Between these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for first guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is NOT in position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  
Since S is confirmed, let’s try a word that places S in a different position and introduces new high-frequency letters.

Candidate: “SHORN”
- S in position 1 (but we know S isn’t in position 1 from feedback), so shift S to position 2.
- Try “CRISP” – but P isn’t common enough.
- Try “SHRIN” – not a valid word.
- Try “SHINS” – 5-letter word, but has S twice; still valid, but less informative.
- Try “CHINS” – C, H, I, N, S: all new letters except S, and S is in position 5 (new position).

“CHINS” seems good: C, H, I, N, S – all new letters except S, and S is in position 5 (different from position 1).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", or ""RAISE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.

Another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help identify vowel positions early.

Looking for words that fit _ _ I _ S with remaining letters:
- BRIUS (valid word, but U is less common)
- DRIUS (valid word, but U is less common)
- PRIUS (valid word, but U is less common)

""BRIUS"" seems the best among these, as it uses common letters B, R, I, U, S. Even though U is less common, it's still a valid word and tests new letters.

This should give us good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.\n\nAnother excellent choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which can help identify vowel positions early.\n\nBetween these, I\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for first guesses.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is NOT in position 1).\n- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word contains S, but not in position 1.\n- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.\n- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.\n\nGood next letters to test: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  \nSince S is confirmed, let’s try a word that places S in a different position and introduces new high-frequency letters.\n\nCandidate: “SHORN”\n- S in position 1 (but we know S isn’t in position 1 from feedback), so shift S to position 2.\n- Try “CRISP” – but P isn’t common enough.\n- Try “SHRIN” – not a valid word.\n- Try “SHINS” – 5-letter word, but has S twice; still valid, but less informative.\n- Try “CHINS” – C, H, I, N, S: all new letters except S, and S is in position 5 (new position).\n\n“CHINS” seems good: C, H, I, N, S – all new letters except S, and S is in position 5 (different from position 1).\n\n<guess>CHINS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on CHINS:\n- C, H, N are NOT in the word.\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).\n\nSo far we know:\n- Pattern: _ _ I _ S\n- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, H, N\n- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

From the new feedback on BRIUS:
- B and U are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the pattern is now: _ R I _ S

Letters NOT in the word so far: L, A, T, E, C, H, N, B, U

Remaining possible letters: D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2, I in position 3, and S in position 5.
2. Uses only the remaining letters.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates:
- D R I V S (DRIVS - not a valid word)
- D R I P S (DRIPS - valid word, but P is less common)
- D R I V E (but E is eliminated)
- F R I E S (but E is eliminated)
- F R I D S (FRIED - but E is eliminated)
- G R I P S (GRIPS - valid word, P is less common)
- P R I Z S (not valid)
- M R I D S (not valid)
- K R I P S (Krips - not a standard word)
- V R I D S (not valid)
- W R I D S (not valid)
- D R I V S (not valid)
- F R I D S (not valid)

Valid words fitting _ R I _ S with remaining letters:
- DRIPS (but P is less common)
- GRIPS (but P is less common)
- PRISM (but M is less common and S is already in position 5)
- FRISK (but K is less common)
- TRIMS (but T is eliminated)
- CRISP (but C is eliminated)
- BRISK (but B is eliminated)
- PRISM (already considered)

""DRIPS"" is the only valid word here, even though P is less common. It tests P in position 4, which is useful.
