For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common remaining letters (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"" (C, R, O, N, E):
- Uses E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this would be invalid).
Wait, E cannot be in position 5, so ""CRONE"" is bad.

Next try ""CHORE"" (C, H, O, R, E):
- E is in position 5 → invalid.

Next try ""MERGE"" (M, E, R, G, E):
- E appears twice, but both in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 is invalid.

Next try ""NERVE"" (N, E, R, V, E):
- E in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 invalid.

Next try ""PREEN"" (P, R, E, E, N):
- E in positions 3 and 4 → both valid positions (not 5).

""PREEN"" uses:
- P, R, E, E, N → avoids S, L, A, T.
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed).

""PREEN"" seems like a good next guess to test new letters and positions for E.

- R (not in position 2)
- One more E (since the word only has one E confirmed so far, but it could have a second E)

Let’s try a word that fits _ _ _ E _ and includes R in a new position, while avoiding all forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- CHORE – but O and H are allowed, R would be in position 3, E in 4. Forbidden letters? No S, L, A, T, P, N. This looks valid.
- DRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden (from PREEN feedback), so skip.
- GRIPE – P is forbidden.
- CRIME – C, R, I, M, E: R in position 2 is forbidden.
- BROKE – B, R, O, K, E: R in position 2 is forbidden.
- CHORE: C, H, O, R, E → R in position 3 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

Let’s go with CHORE.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x):
S, L, A, T, P, N, C, H, O

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
R (from PREEN and CHORE feedback: R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4)
E (from SLATE and CHORE: E is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5)

Also note:
- From PREEN: the second E (position 4) was marked ✓, so E is definitely in position 4.
- From CHORE: the E in position 2 was marked (-), confirming E is not in position 2.

So the word structure is: _ _ _ E _  
And it must contain R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5) and no forbidden letters.

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and avoiding all forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BRIEF – B, R, I, E, F → R in position 2 is forbidden (from PREEN).
- DRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden.
- GRIPE – P is forbidden.
- FRIED – D is allowed, R in position 2 is forbidden.
- WRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden.
- BURGE – B, U, R, G, E → R in position 3 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

BURGE fits the pattern _ _ _ E _ with R in position 3 and no forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common remaining letters (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"" (C, R, O, N, E):
- Uses E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this would be invalid).
Wait, E cannot be in position 5, so ""CRONE"" is bad.

Next try ""CHORE"" (C, H, O, R, E):
- E is in position 5 → invalid.

Next try ""MERGE"" (M, E, R, G, E):
- E appears twice, but both in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 is invalid.

Next try ""NERVE"" (N, E, R, V, E):
- E in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 invalid.

Next try ""PREEN"" (P, R, E, E, N):
- E in positions 3 and 4 → both valid positions (not 5).

""PREEN"" uses:
- P, R, E, E, N → avoids S, L, A, T.
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed).

""PREEN"" seems like a good next guess to test new letters and positions for E.

Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x):
S, L, A, T, P, N, C, H, O, B, U, G

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R (must appear; feedback says it’s in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4)
- E (must appear; feedback says it’s in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, 5)

From earlier feedback:
- E is **confirmed** in position 4 (✓ from PREEN).
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from PREEN, CHORE, BURGE).
- Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.

So the word structure is:  
R _ _ E _   or   _ _ _ E R

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
D, F, I, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these two patterns.

Pattern 1: R _ _ E _  
Possible candidates: RIFLE, ROWER, RIVER, RIFTE, RIGER, RAKER, ROWER, RIFLE  
- RIFLE: R, I, F, L, E → L is forbidden (x in SLATE).
- RIVER: R, I, V, E, R → second R would be in position 5 (allowed), but we only need one R.
- ROWER: O is forbidden.
- RIGER: G is forbidden.
- RAKER: A is forbidden.
- RIFTE: T is forbidden.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all (x):
S, L, A, T, P, N, C, H, O, B, U, G

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R (must appear; feedback says it’s in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4)
- E (must appear; feedback says it’s in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, 5)

From earlier feedback:
- E is **confirmed** in position 4 (✓ from PREEN).
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from PREEN, CHORE, BURGE).
- Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.

So the word structure is:  
R _ _ E _   or   _ _ _ E R

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
D, F, I, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it uses S, L, A, T, E - covering 5 of the most common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT as the last letter.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.
3. Uses other common remaining letters (R, N, I, O, C, etc.).

Good candidate letters left: R, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, G, H, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""CRONE"" (C, R, O, N, E):
- Uses E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5, so this would be invalid).
Wait, E cannot be in position 5, so ""CRONE"" is bad.

Next try ""CHORE"" (C, H, O, R, E):
- E is in position 5 → invalid.

Next try ""MERGE"" (M, E, R, G, E):
- E appears twice, but both in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 is invalid.

Next try ""NERVE"" (N, E, R, V, E):
- E in positions 2 and 5 → position 5 invalid.

Next try ""PREEN"" (P, R, E, E, N):
- E in positions 3 and 4 → both valid positions (not 5).

""PREEN"" uses:
- P, R, E, E, N → avoids S, L, A, T.
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (both allowed).

""PREEN"" seems like a good next guess to test new letters and positions for E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, P, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: R, E (except the second E is already fixed in position 4)  
Letter that is in the word and already in the correct position: E in position 4  

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ E _  
It must contain R somewhere (but not in position 2) and must not contain any of S, L, A, T, P, N.

Remaining candidate letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We still need to place:
- R (not in position 2)
- One more E (since the word only has one E confirmed so far, but it could have a second E)

Let’s try a word that fits _ _ _ E _ and includes R in a new position, while avoiding all forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- CHORE – but O and H are allowed, R would be in position 3, E in 4. Forbidden letters? No S, L, A, T, P, N. This looks valid.
- DRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden (from PREEN feedback), so skip.
- GRIPE – P is forbidden.
- CRIME – C, R, I, M, E: R in position 2 is forbidden.
- BROKE – B, R, O, K, E: R in position 2 is forbidden.
- CHORE: C, H, O, R, E → R in position 3 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

Let’s go with CHORE.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x):
S, L, A, T, P, N, C, H, O

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
R (from PREEN and CHORE feedback: R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 4)
E (from SLATE and CHORE: E is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5)

Also note:
- From PREEN: the second E (position 4) was marked ✓, so E is definitely in position 4.
- From CHORE: the E in position 2 was marked (-), confirming E is not in position 2.

So the word structure is: _ _ _ E _  
And it must contain R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5) and no forbidden letters.

Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R, and avoiding all forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BRIEF – B, R, I, E, F → R in position 2 is forbidden (from PREEN).
- DRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden.
- GRIPE – P is forbidden.
- FRIED – D is allowed, R in position 2 is forbidden.
- WRIER – R in position 2 is forbidden.
- BURGE – B, U, R, G, E → R in position 3 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

BURGE fits the pattern _ _ _ E _ with R in position 3 and no forbidden letters.

Let's try BURGE.

Letters that **are** in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- R (must appear; feedback says it’s in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4)

Now we have:

- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – E is fixed in position 4 (✓ from DIVER)
  – R is fixed in position 5 (✓ from DIVER)

So the word ends in “…ER” and must contain only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters: F, I, K, M, W, Y, etc.

We still need three more letters for positions 1, 2, 3, with the constraints:
- No forbidden letters
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5

Possible patterns: _ _ _ E R

Let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in “ER” and using only allowed letters:
- F I E R → only 4 letters
- K I E R → not a valid word
- M I E R → not a valid word
- W I E R → not a valid word
- F R E E R → too long
- F I V E R → V is forbidden
- F R E S H E R → too long
- M I C E R → C is forbidden
- F L E E R → L is forbidden
- F R E E R → E is already used twice (but word may have two E’s)
- F R E E R → R already used
- F R E E R → valid word but R already used
- F R E E R → E is position 4, R position 5
- F R E E R → letters F, R, E, E, R → F allowed, R allowed, E allowed, second E allowed, second R allowed.

But we need only one R and one E in position 4. The word “FREER” has two E’s and two R’s, but we only need one of each in the positions already fixed.

Actually, we need a word with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- No forbidden letters in positions 1-3

Valid candidates:
- F I E R → not a 5-letter word
- M I E R → not a word
- W I E R → not a word
- K I E R → not a word
- F R E E R → 5-letter word, but R is already in position 5
- F R E S H → not ending in ER
- F R E E → too short
- F R E E R → valid 5-letter word, but has second R and E

Actually, the only common 5-letter word ending in “ER” with E in position 4 and R in position 5, using allowed letters, is “FREER”.

Let’s check:
F – allowed
R – allowed (position 2 is fine because we only know R must be in position 5)
E – allowed (position 4 is correct)
E – allowed (second E is okay)
R – allowed (position 5 is correct)

All letters are allowed and positions fit constraints.

Therefore, the word must be FREER.

- F R E E R → E is position 4, R position 5
- F R E E R → letters F, R, E, E, R → F allowed, R allowed, E allowed, second E allowed, second R allowed.

But we need only one R and one E in position 4. The word “FREER” has two E’s and two R’s, but we only need one of each in the positions already fixed.

Actually, we need a word with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- No forbidden letters in positions 1-3

Valid candidates:
- F I E R → not a 5-letter word
- M I E R → not a word
- W I E R → not a word
- K I E R → not a word
- F R E E R → 5-letter word, but R is already in position 5
- F R E S H → not ending in ER
- F R E E → too short
- F R E E R → valid 5-letter word, but has second R and E

Actually, the only common 5-letter word ending in “ER” with E in position 4 and R in position 5, using allowed letters, is “FREER”.

Let’s check:
F – allowed
R – allowed (position 2 is fine because we only know R must be in position 5)
E – allowed (position 4 is correct)
E – allowed (second E is okay)
R – allowed (position 5 is correct)

All letters are allowed and positions fit constraints.

Therefore, the word must be FREER.",Guess 6: FREER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
