1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can quickly reveal which vowels are present in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with the inclusion of 'O'.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
To probe the remaining alphabet, I’ll pick a word that uses the next most frequent letters that were not in AROSE.  
The remaining common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
The remaining vowels are I, U, Y (sometimes).  

A balanced starter that avoids A, R, O, S, E and still covers several high-frequency letters is “UNITY”.  
It gives us U, N, I, T, Y – all still possible and tests four fresh vowels/consonants in one go.

(Other strong alternatives would be “UNTIL”, “INPUT”, “CHILD”, etc., but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced for the first follow-up.)

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are all **not** in the word (x).
- U and I are in the word but in the **wrong** positions (they appeared in positions 1 and 3 in UNITY, so they must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Letters still available (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the known letters U and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U and I (since they’re in the word).
2. Does **not** contain any of A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y.
3. Places U and I in **different** positions than 1 and 3 (so U not in position 1, I not in position 3).

A quick scan of valid words fitting these constraints gives “BUILD”:
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D – none of the forbidden letters appear.
- U is in position 2 (different from position 1 in UNITY).
- I is in position 3 (same as in UNITY, but since we know it’s just “wrong position”, we can try it again in a different slot; the feedback didn’t specify which slot is correct, just that slot 3 was wrong in UNITY, so we can’t rely on that).  
Wait – in UNITY, I was in position 3 and got “-”, so I **cannot** be in position 3 again. So “BUILD” is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

Let’s pick “QUICK” – but Q and K are allowed, but we have to check:
- Q, U, I, C, K – none of the forbidden letters.
- U in position 2 (allowed).
- I in position 3 – but this is the same as before, so invalid.

Next candidate: “FILMY” – but Y is forbidden.

Next: “MILCH” – but H is allowed:
- M, I, L, C, H – no forbidden letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is missing, but we know U is in the word. So this is invalid.

We must include U and I. Let’s try “LUNCH” – but N and C and H are allowed, but N is forbidden.

Try “QUICK” again – Q, U, I, C, K – no forbidden letters.
- U is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 – but this was its previous position, so it’s still invalid.

Try “DUKIC” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Valid word: “FILUM” – but M is allowed, and it has U and I:
- F, I, L, U, M – no forbidden letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 1 before).

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Another valid option: “FUGUE” – but E is forbidden.

“FILUM” looks good.

But let me double-check: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are forbidden.  
F, I, L, U, M – none of these are in the forbidden set.

Positions:
- I in position 2 (was in position 3 before, so allowed).

- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is missing, but we know U is in the word. So this is invalid.

We must include U and I. Let’s try “LUNCH” – but N and C and H are allowed, but N is forbidden.

Try “QUICK” again – Q, U, I, C, K – no forbidden letters.
- U is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 – but this was its previous position, so it’s still invalid.

Try “DUKIC” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Valid word: “FILUM” – but M is allowed, and it has U and I:
- F, I, L, U, M – no forbidden letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 1 before).

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Another valid option: “FUGUE” – but E is forbidden.

“FILUM” looks good.

But let me double-check: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are forbidden.  
F, I, L, U, M – none of these are in the forbidden set.

Positions:
- I in position 2 (was in position 3 before, so allowed).
- U in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so allowed).

Thus, “FILUM” is a valid next guess.

- U, I, M (each is “in word, wrong place”)
- Does **not** contain: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, F, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters **not** in the forbidden set above.
2. Uses **U, I, M** (each once).
3. Places **U** somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
4. Places **I** somewhere other than position 2.
5. Places **M** somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining allowed letters (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus the known U, I, M.

Let’s list possible positions for U, I, M:

- U can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- I can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- M can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We need to assign U, I, M to three distinct positions and fill the remaining two slots with allowed letters (no repeats of any letter already used).

A quick scan of valid English words that contain U, I, M and only allowed letters gives:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and can quickly reveal which vowels are present in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage with the inclusion of 'O'.

<|im_end|>

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
To probe the remaining alphabet, I’ll pick a word that uses the next most frequent letters that were not in AROSE.  
The remaining common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.  
The remaining vowels are I, U, Y (sometimes).  

A balanced starter that avoids A, R, O, S, E and still covers several high-frequency letters is “UNITY”.  
It gives us U, N, I, T, Y – all still possible and tests four fresh vowels/consonants in one go.

(Other strong alternatives would be “UNTIL”, “INPUT”, “CHILD”, etc., but “UNITY” feels slightly more balanced for the first follow-up.)

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are all **not** in the word (x).
- U and I are in the word but in the **wrong** positions (they appeared in positions 1 and 3 in UNITY, so they must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Letters still available (high-frequency ones in bold):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the known letters U and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains U and I (since they’re in the word).
2. Does **not** contain any of A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y.
3. Places U and I in **different** positions than 1 and 3 (so U not in position 1, I not in position 3).

A quick scan of valid words fitting these constraints gives “BUILD”:
- Letters: B, U, I, L, D – none of the forbidden letters appear.
- U is in position 2 (different from position 1 in UNITY).
- I is in position 3 (same as in UNITY, but since we know it’s just “wrong position”, we can try it again in a different slot; the feedback didn’t specify which slot is correct, just that slot 3 was wrong in UNITY, so we can’t rely on that).  
Wait – in UNITY, I was in position 3 and got “-”, so I **cannot** be in position 3 again. So “BUILD” is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

Let’s pick “QUICK” – but Q and K are allowed, but we have to check:
- Q, U, I, C, K – none of the forbidden letters.
- U in position 2 (allowed).
- I in position 3 – but this is the same as before, so invalid.

Next candidate: “FILMY” – but Y is forbidden.

Next: “MILCH” – but H is allowed:
- M, I, L, C, H – no forbidden letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is missing, but we know U is in the word. So this is invalid.

We must include U and I. Let’s try “LUNCH” – but N and C and H are allowed, but N is forbidden.

Try “QUICK” again – Q, U, I, C, K – no forbidden letters.
- U is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 – but this was its previous position, so it’s still invalid.

Try “DUKIC” – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Valid word: “FILUM” – but M is allowed, and it has U and I:
- F, I, L, U, M – no forbidden letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 1 before).

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Another valid option: “FUGUE” – but E is forbidden.

“FILUM” looks good.

But let me double-check: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are forbidden.  
F, I, L, U, M – none of these are in the forbidden set.

Positions:
- I in position 2 (was in position 3 before, so allowed).

So “BUILD” is invalid because it puts I in position 3.\n\nLet’s pick “QUICK” – but Q and K are allowed, but we have to check:\n- Q, U, I, C, K – none of the forbidden letters.\n- U in position 2 (allowed).\n- I in position 3 – but this is the same as before, so invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “FILMY” – but Y is forbidden.\n\nNext: “MILCH” – but H is allowed:\n- M, I, L, C, H – no forbidden letters.\n- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).\n- U is missing, but we know U is in the word. So this is invalid.\n\nWe must include U and I. Let’s try “LUNCH” – but N and C and H are allowed, but N is forbidden.\n\nTry “QUICK” again – Q, U, I, C, K – no forbidden letters.\n- U is in position 2 (allowed).\n- I is in position 3 – but this was its previous position, so it’s still invalid.\n\nTry “DUKIC” – but this isn’t a valid English word.\n\nValid word: “FILUM” – but M is allowed, and it has U and I:\n- F, I, L, U, M – no forbidden letters.\n- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it was in position 3 before).\n- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in position 1 before).\n\nThis seems to satisfy all constraints.\n\nAnother valid option: “FUGUE” – but E is forbidden.\n\n“FILUM” looks good.\n\nBut let me double-check: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y are forbidden.  \nF, I, L, U, M – none of these are in the forbidden set.\n\nPositions:\n- I in position 2 (was in position 3 before, so allowed).\n- U in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so allowed).\n\nThus, “FILUM” is a valid next guess.\n\n<guess>FILUM</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) I(-) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: FILUM -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(x) U(-) M(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on FILUM:\n\n- F(x), L(x), M(-) ⇒ F and L are not in the word.  \n- I(-) ⇒ I is in the word but **not** in position 2.  \n- U(-) ⇒ U is in the word but **not** in position 4.  \n- M(-) ⇒ M is in the word but **not** in position 5.\n\nSo far we know the secret word contains:\n\n- U, I, M (each is “in word, wrong place”)\n- Does **not** contain: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, Y, F, L\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

From the feedback on MUGID:

- M(✓) → M is in position 1 and correct.
- U(✓) → U is in position 2 and correct.
- I(✓) → I is in position 4 and correct.
- D(✓) → D is in position 5 and correct.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.

So the secret word is now fully determined: M U _ I D.

The only missing letter is in position 3.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not in the forbidden list).

Looking for common 5-letter English words matching the pattern MU_ID:

- M U C I D → MUCID (valid but uncommon)  
- M U B I D → no such word  
- M U H I D → no  
- M U K I D → MUKID (not a recognized word)  
- M U P I D → no  
- M U V I D → no  
- M U W I D → no  
- M U X I D → no  
- M U Q I D → no  
- M U J I D → no  

The only recognizable English word fitting M U _ I D is **MUCID** (though it is quite rare). However, ""MUCID"" is listed in some dictionaries as an archaic or dialectal form of ""mucuous"". Given the constraints, this appears to be the only possible word.

But let me double-check: is there another common word?  
No, the pattern MU_ID does not yield any standard English word except MUCID.

Therefore, the secret word must be MUCID.
