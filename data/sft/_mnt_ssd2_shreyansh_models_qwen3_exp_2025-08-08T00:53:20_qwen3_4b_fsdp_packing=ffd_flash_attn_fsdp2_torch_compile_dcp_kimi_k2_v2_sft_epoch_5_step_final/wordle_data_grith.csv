For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

These words cover many common letters and help identify which letters are in the secret word. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that appear in many English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ T _

1. Has T as the 4th letter.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U, Y.

Possible candidates:
- FRUIT (but has U and I, and F/R are good)
- CRUIT (but C is good, but ""CRUIT"" isn't a common word)
- POINT (P, O, I, N, T - good letters, T in correct spot)
- DROPT (but has P twice)

Let’s carefully re-examine the feedback so far.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   - T is in the word and in the correct position: _ _ _ T _

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(-)  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because the symbol is “-” here, not “✓”).  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because the symbol is “-” here).  
   - P, O, N are absent.

3. MIGHT → M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - M is absent.

Combining all constraints:

- Known positions:  
  – Position 4 must be T (from SLATE feedback).  
  – T is NOT in position 5 (from POINT feedback), which is already satisfied.

- Known letters:  
  – I must be somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from POINT and MIGHT feedback).  
    Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

- Known letters that are in the word but not yet placed:  
  – G (not in position 3)  
  – H (not in position 4)  
  – T (already fixed in position 4)

- Absent letters so far: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Thus the pattern is:  
I or ?   (not I)   (not G)   T   (not H or I)  
with I forced to be in position 1 or 5.

Candidate patterns:
1. I _ _ T _  
2. _ _ _ T I  

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, R, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s test pattern 1: I _ _ T _  
We need two letters in positions 2 and 3, chosen from allowed letters, and one more letter in position 5.

We also know:
- G must appear somewhere (from MIGHT feedback), but not in position 3.  
- H must appear somewhere (from MIGHT feedback), but not in position 4 (already T).

So G and H must fit into positions 2, 3, 5.

Possible combinations:
- I G H T ? – but H cannot be in position 4 (already T), so this is invalid.  
- I G ? T H – positions 2=G, 3=?, 5=H.  
- I H G T ? – positions 2=H, 3=G, but G cannot be in position 3 (from MIGHT feedback).  
- I ? G T H – positions 2=?, 3=G, 5=H.  

Looking for valid words:
- I G R T H – no such word.  
- I C G T H – no.  
- I R G T H – no.  
- I B G T H – no.  

Pattern 2: _ _ _ T I  
Positions 1, 2, 3 must contain G and H (since both must appear) and one more allowed letter.

Possible combinations:
- G H ? T I – positions 1=G, 2=H, 3=?.  
- G ? H T I – positions 1=G, 2=?, 3=H.  
- H G ? T I – positions 1=H, 2=G, 3=?.  
- H ? G T I – positions 1=H, 2=?, 3=G.  

Looking for valid words:
- G H R T I – no.  
- G R H T I – no.  
- R G H T I – no.  
- C H R T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- C H G T I – no.  
- B H G T I – no.  
- D H G T I – no.  

Wait, let’s try pattern 1 again with different letters.

We need:
- Position 1: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: must be I (from pattern 2) – but that would duplicate I, which is impossible.  
Therefore pattern 1 is invalid because I cannot appear twice.

Thus the only valid pattern is pattern 2: _ _ _ T I  
Positions 1, 2, 3 must contain G and H (each must appear once) and one more allowed letter.

Let’s list possible words fitting _ _ _ T I with G, H, and one more allowed letter:

- C H G T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- C R H T I – no.  
- B H R T I – no.  
- D H R T I – no.  

Hmm, none seem valid. Let’s try different letters.

We need:
- Word must contain I (in position 5)  
- Word must contain G and H somewhere in positions 1-3  
- Word must not contain any absent letters (S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M)  
- Position 4 is T

Possible valid word:  
- C H R T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- G R H T I – no.  

Wait, let’s try ""CHIRT"" – but that’s not a valid word.  
""GRITH"" – not valid.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  
""DRIGHT"" – not valid.  
""FRIGHT"" – too long.  

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word I can find that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H, and no forbidden letters is:

- ""RIGHT"" – but that’s 5 letters: R, I, G, H, T  
  - Positions: R(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) – but position 4 must be T, so this would be R I G T H – but then T is in position 4, and H is in position 5, but we need I in position 5.  

Wait, let’s re-express:

We need _ _ _ T I (positions 1,2,3,4,5)  
with:
- I in position 5  
- G and H in positions 1-3  
- T in position 4  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Valid word:  
- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  

Actually, the only valid word I can find is ""RIGHT"" – but that would be R I G H T, which has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words ending with TI and containing G and H in positions 1-3:

- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  

Actually, there is no common 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H, and no forbidden letters. This suggests I might have missed a letter.

Re-examining: from MIGHT feedback, G is in the word but not in position 3, and H is in the word but not in position 4 (already T). So both G and H must appear in positions 1-3, and I must appear in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is I (from pattern), so I must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: I _ _ T I – impossible, duplicate I.

Therefore, the only possible pattern is _ _ _ T I with G, H in positions 1-3.

But no valid word fits. This implies I must have made an error.

Rechecking: from MIGHT feedback, the symbols are:
M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)

This means:
- I is in the word but not in position 2  
- G is in the word but not in position 3  
- H is in the word but not in position 4  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know from SLATE it is in position 4) – this is consistent.

Thus the word must contain I, G, H, T (position 4), and one more letter.

Pattern: _ _ _ T I (positions 1-5)  
with G and H in positions 1-3, and I in position 5.

Valid word: ""RIGHT"" – R, I, G, H, T – positions: R(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) – but this has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Wait, ""RIGHT"" is spelled R I G H T, so positions: 1=R, 2=I, 3=G, 4=H, 5=T. This has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Thus ""RIGHT"" is invalid.

Another valid word: ""CHIRT"" – no.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  

Actually, the only valid word I can find that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H in positions 1-3 is ""RIGHT"" but that has T in position 5.  

This suggests there is no valid word, but that’s impossible. Let me try different letters.

We need:
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Positions 1-3: must contain G and H and one more allowed letter (not S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M)

Possible letters for position 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, R, U, W, Y

Let’s try:
- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  

Actually, the word ""RIGHT"" is the only one, but it has T in position 5.  

This indicates I must have missed something. Let me re-express:

We have:
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Must contain G and H in positions 1-3  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Valid word: ""CHIRT"" – no.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  

Wait, ""GRIT"" is 4 letters.  

Actually, the correct word must be ""RIGHT"" but rearranged to fit _ _ _ T I.

But ""RIGHT"" is R I G H T, so to fit _ _ _ T I, it would have to be R I G T I – impossible.

This suggests the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but then T is in position 4, and H is in position 5, and I is in position 2. But from POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3, and from MIGHT, I is not in position 2. So I can be in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is I, so I must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: I _ _ T I – impossible.

This indicates I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading MIGHT feedback:
M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)

This means:
- M is not in the word.  
- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- G is in the word but not in position 3.  
- H is in the word but not in position 4.  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know from SLATE it is in position 4) – this is consistent.

Thus the word must contain I, G, H, T (position 4), and one more letter.

Possible positions:
- T is in position 4.  
- I must be in position 1 or 5.  
- G and H must be in positions 1-3, and not in positions already taken.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Need G, H, and one more letter in positions 2,3,5.  
- I is in position 1.  
- G and H must be in positions 2,3, or 5.  
- But position 5 can be I, but I is already in position 1.  

Actually, the word must be I _ _ T _ with G, H in positions 2,3,5, and one more letter.

But we have only 5 letters: I, G, H, T, and one more.

Let’s try ""IGT"" plus two more letters, but this is getting complicated.

Actually, the correct approach is to realize that the word must contain I, G, H, T, and one more letter, with T in position 4, I in position 1 or 5, G and H in positions 1-3 or 5.

But given the constraints, the only possible word is ""RIGHT"" but rearranged.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied (it's in position 2). From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

Thus I cannot be in position 2.

Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

If I is in position 1: I _ _ T _  
Then G and H must be in positions 2,3,5.  
But position 5 can be H, and positions 2,3 can be G and another letter.

But we have only 5 letters: I, G, H, T, and one more. The one more must be from allowed letters (B, C, D, F, K, R, U, W, Y).

Let’s try ""IGT"" plus two more letters.

Actually, the word must be I G _ T H – positions 1=I, 2=G, 3=?, 4=T, 5=H. The missing letter in position 3 must be from allowed letters and also must form a valid word.

Possible word: I G R T H – ""IGRT H"" – no.  
I G B T H – no.  
I G C T H – no.  

This seems impossible. Let me try I _ G T _ with H in position 5.

I _ G T H – positions 1=I, 2=?, 3=G, 4=T, 5=H.  
The missing letter in position 2 must be from allowed letters and form a valid word.

Possible word: I R G T H – no.  
I C G T H – no.  
I B G T H – no.  

This indicates I must have missed a letter. Let me list all constraints again:

Letters in word: I, G, H, T, and one more (not S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M).  
Positions:
- T is in position 4.  
- I is in position 1 or 5.  
- G is not in position 3.  
- H is not in position 4 (already T).  

If I is in position 5: _ _ _ T I  
Then G and H must be in positions 1-3, and one more letter.

Possible word: C H R T I – no.  
B R H T I – no.  
D R H T I – no.  
F R H T I – no.  
G R H T I – no.  

Actually, the word ""RIGHT"" is the only one, but it doesn't fit.

After careful search, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied. From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

This suggests the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with I in position 1:

I R G T H – but this has T in position 4, H in position 5, and I in position 1. This satisfies:
- I in position 1 (not in position 2 or 3)  
- G in position 3 (but MIGHT says G is not in position 3) – this violates.

Thus G cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, G must be in position 1 or 2, and H in position 1,2, or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: G  
- Position 2: H  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Position 3: must be one more letter from allowed letters.

Valid word: G H _ T I – positions 3 must be a letter forming a word.  
Possible: G H R T I – no.  
G H C T I – no.  
G H B T I – no.  

This seems impossible. Let me try position 1: H, position 2: G:

H G _ T I – positions 3: must be a letter.  
H G R T I – no.  

After exhaustive search, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but rearranged, which indicates I must have made an error.

Realizing the oversight: the word must contain I, G, H, T, and one more letter, with T in position 4, I in position 1 or 5, G not in position 3, H not in position 4 (already T).

The correct word is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied (it's in position 2). From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

This indicates the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with I in position 1:

I R G T H – but this has G in position 3, which violates MIGHT feedback.

Thus, the only possible arrangement is:

G R I T H – positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)  
Check constraints:
- T in position 4 – ✓  
- I in position 3 – but POINT feedback says I is in the word but not in position 3 – this violates.

This is perplexing. Let me try:

H R I T G – but this has T in position 4, I in position 3 – violates.

Finally, the correct arrangement must be:

C H I R T – but this has T in position 5.

Realizing the only possible word is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, which is impossible as it would require T in position 4 and 5.

Thus, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, which is not possible. This suggests an error in earlier steps.

Rechecking: from SLATE, T is in position 4. From POINT, I is in the word but not in position 3. From MIGHT, G and H are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Thus, the word must be:

_ _ I T _ with I in position 3, but POINT feedback says I is not in position 3. This contradicts.

Ah! Here is the critical error: re-reading POINT feedback carefully:

POINT → P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(-)

The symbol ""✓"" for I means I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). The symbol ""-"" for T means T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus, from POINT:
- I is in position 3.  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (position 4 is already confirmed from SLATE).

Thus the pattern is: _ _ I T _  
Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, E, P, O, N  
Letters known to be in the word: I (position 3), T (position 4), and also G and H (from MIGHT feedback).

Thus the word must contain I, T, G, H, and one more letter, with:
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: T  
- G and H must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
- One more letter is needed.

Possible word: G H I T ? – but position 5 must be a letter, and we have only 5 letters.

Thus the word must be G H I T ? – but this is 4 letters plus one more.

Actually, the word must be 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- 3: I  
- 4: T  
- must contain G and H in 1,2, or 5  
- one more letter.

Possible arrangements:
- G H I T ? – but need 5 letters.  
- G I T H ? – but position 3 is I, so this is G(1), I(2), T(3) – violates position 3 must be I.

Correct pattern: _ _ I T _  
Thus:

Position 1: must be G or H or another letter  
Position 2: must be G or H or another letter  
Position 3: I  
Position 4: T  
Position 5: must be G or H or another letter, but G and H must both appear.

Thus possible words:
- G H I T ? – but need 5 letters.  
- G I T H ? – but position 3 is I, so G(1), I(2), T(3) – violates.

Actually, the word must be:

G R I T H – positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)  
Check constraints:
- I in position 3 – ✓ (from POINT)  
- T in position 4 – ✓ (from SLATE)  
- G in position 1 – satisfies G is in word but not in position 3 (from MIGHT)  
- H in position 5 – satisfies H is in word but not in position 4 (from MIGHT)  
- R is the fifth letter, not in forbidden set.

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Contains I (position 3) and T (position 4) – ✓  
- Contains G (position 1) and H (position 5) – ✓  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N – ✓  
- G not in position 3 – ✓  
- H not in position 4 – ✓  

Thus, the correct next guess is ""G R I T H"".
</think>

Based on the accumulated constraints, the only valid word that fits all the feedback is ""GRITH"".

<guess>GRITH</guess>",GRITH,"Let’s carefully re-examine the feedback so far.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)  
   - T is in the word and in the correct position: _ _ _ T _

2. POINT → P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(-)  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because the symbol is “-” here, not “✓”).  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because the symbol is “-” here).  
   - P, O, N are absent.

3. MIGHT → M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - M is absent.

Combining all constraints:

- Known positions:  
  – Position 4 must be T (from SLATE feedback).  
  – T is NOT in position 5 (from POINT feedback), which is already satisfied.

- Known letters:  
  – I must be somewhere in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from POINT and MIGHT feedback).  
    Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

- Known letters that are in the word but not yet placed:  
  – G (not in position 3)  
  – H (not in position 4)  
  – T (already fixed in position 4)

- Absent letters so far: S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Thus the pattern is:  
I or ?   (not I)   (not G)   T   (not H or I)  
with I forced to be in position 1 or 5.

Candidate patterns:
1. I _ _ T _  
2. _ _ _ T I  

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, R, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s test pattern 1: I _ _ T _  
We need two letters in positions 2 and 3, chosen from allowed letters, and one more letter in position 5.

We also know:
- G must appear somewhere (from MIGHT feedback), but not in position 3.  
- H must appear somewhere (from MIGHT feedback), but not in position 4 (already T).

So G and H must fit into positions 2, 3, 5.

Possible combinations:
- I G H T ? – but H cannot be in position 4 (already T), so this is invalid.  
- I G ? T H – positions 2=G, 3=?, 5=H.  
- I H G T ? – positions 2=H, 3=G, but G cannot be in position 3 (from MIGHT feedback).  
- I ? G T H – positions 2=?, 3=G, 5=H.  

Looking for valid words:
- I G R T H – no such word.  
- I C G T H – no.  
- I R G T H – no.  
- I B G T H – no.  

Pattern 2: _ _ _ T I  
Positions 1, 2, 3 must contain G and H (since both must appear) and one more allowed letter.

Possible combinations:
- G H ? T I – positions 1=G, 2=H, 3=?.  
- G ? H T I – positions 1=G, 2=?, 3=H.  
- H G ? T I – positions 1=H, 2=G, 3=?.  
- H ? G T I – positions 1=H, 2=?, 3=G.  

Looking for valid words:
- G H R T I – no.  
- G R H T I – no.  
- R G H T I – no.  
- C H R T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- C H G T I – no.  
- B H G T I – no.  
- D H G T I – no.  

Wait, let’s try pattern 1 again with different letters.

We need:
- Position 1: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: must be I (from pattern 2) – but that would duplicate I, which is impossible.  
Therefore pattern 1 is invalid because I cannot appear twice.

Thus the only valid pattern is pattern 2: _ _ _ T I  
Positions 1, 2, 3 must contain G and H (each must appear once) and one more allowed letter.

Let’s list possible words fitting _ _ _ T I with G, H, and one more allowed letter:

- C H G T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- C R H T I – no.  
- B H R T I – no.  
- D H R T I – no.  

Hmm, none seem valid. Let’s try different letters.

We need:
- Word must contain I (in position 5)  
- Word must contain G and H somewhere in positions 1-3  
- Word must not contain any absent letters (S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M)  
- Position 4 is T

Possible valid word:  
- C H R T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  
- F R H T I – no.  
- G R H T I – no.  

Wait, let’s try ""CHIRT"" – but that’s not a valid word.  
""GRITH"" – not valid.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  
""DRIGHT"" – not valid.  
""FRIGHT"" – too long.  

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word I can find that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H, and no forbidden letters is:

- ""RIGHT"" – but that’s 5 letters: R, I, G, H, T  
  - Positions: R(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) – but position 4 must be T, so this would be R I G T H – but then T is in position 4, and H is in position 5, but we need I in position 5.  

Wait, let’s re-express:

We need _ _ _ T I (positions 1,2,3,4,5)  
with:
- I in position 5  
- G and H in positions 1-3  
- T in position 4  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Valid word:  
- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  

Actually, the only valid word I can find is ""RIGHT"" – but that would be R I G H T, which has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words ending with TI and containing G and H in positions 1-3:

- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  

Actually, there is no common 5-letter word that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H, and no forbidden letters. This suggests I might have missed a letter.

Re-examining: from MIGHT feedback, G is in the word but not in position 3, and H is in the word but not in position 4 (already T). So both G and H must appear in positions 1-3, and I must appear in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is I (from pattern), so I must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: I _ _ T I – impossible, duplicate I.

Therefore, the only possible pattern is _ _ _ T I with G, H in positions 1-3.

But no valid word fits. This implies I must have made an error.

Rechecking: from MIGHT feedback, the symbols are:
M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)

This means:
- I is in the word but not in position 2  
- G is in the word but not in position 3  
- H is in the word but not in position 4  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know from SLATE it is in position 4) – this is consistent.

Thus the word must contain I, G, H, T (position 4), and one more letter.

Pattern: _ _ _ T I (positions 1-5)  
with G and H in positions 1-3, and I in position 5.

Valid word: ""RIGHT"" – R, I, G, H, T – positions: R(1), I(2), G(3), H(4), T(5) – but this has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Wait, ""RIGHT"" is spelled R I G H T, so positions: 1=R, 2=I, 3=G, 4=H, 5=T. This has T in position 5, but we need T in position 4.  

Thus ""RIGHT"" is invalid.

Another valid word: ""CHIRT"" – no.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  

Actually, the only valid word I can find that fits _ _ _ T I with G, H in positions 1-3 is ""RIGHT"" but that has T in position 5.  

This suggests there is no valid word, but that’s impossible. Let me try different letters.

We need:
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Positions 1-3: must contain G and H and one more allowed letter (not S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M)

Possible letters for position 1-3: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, R, U, W, Y

Let’s try:
- C H R T I – no.  
- G H R T I – no.  
- R H G T I – no.  
- B R H T I – no.  
- D R H T I – no.  

Actually, the word ""RIGHT"" is the only one, but it has T in position 5.  

This indicates I must have missed something. Let me re-express:

We have:
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Must contain G and H in positions 1-3  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M

Valid word: ""CHIRT"" – no.  
""BRIGHT"" – too long.  

Wait, ""GRIT"" is 4 letters.  

Actually, the correct word must be ""RIGHT"" but rearranged to fit _ _ _ T I.

But ""RIGHT"" is R I G H T, so to fit _ _ _ T I, it would have to be R I G T I – impossible.

This suggests the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but then T is in position 4, and H is in position 5, and I is in position 2. But from POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3, and from MIGHT, I is not in position 2. So I can be in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is I, so I must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: I _ _ T I – impossible.

This indicates I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-reading MIGHT feedback:
M(x) I(-) G(-) H(-) T(-)

This means:
- M is not in the word.  
- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- G is in the word but not in position 3.  
- H is in the word but not in position 4.  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know from SLATE it is in position 4) – this is consistent.

Thus the word must contain I, G, H, T (position 4), and one more letter.

Possible positions:
- T is in position 4.  
- I must be in position 1 or 5.  
- G and H must be in positions 1-3, and not in positions already taken.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: I  
- Position 4: T  
- Need G, H, and one more letter in positions 2,3,5.  
- I is in position 1.  
- G and H must be in positions 2,3, or 5.  
- But position 5 can be I, but I is already in position 1.  

Actually, the word must be I _ _ T _ with G, H in positions 2,3,5, and one more letter.

But we have only 5 letters: I, G, H, T, and one more.

Let’s try ""IGT"" plus two more letters, but this is getting complicated.

Actually, the correct approach is to realize that the word must contain I, G, H, T, and one more letter, with T in position 4, I in position 1 or 5, G and H in positions 1-3 or 5.

But given the constraints, the only possible word is ""RIGHT"" but rearranged.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied (it's in position 2). From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

Thus I cannot be in position 2.

Therefore I must be in position 1 or 5.

If I is in position 1: I _ _ T _  
Then G and H must be in positions 2,3,5.  
But position 5 can be H, and positions 2,3 can be G and another letter.

But we have only 5 letters: I, G, H, T, and one more. The one more must be from allowed letters (B, C, D, F, K, R, U, W, Y).

Let’s try ""IGT"" plus two more letters.

Actually, the word must be I G _ T H – positions 1=I, 2=G, 3=?, 4=T, 5=H. The missing letter in position 3 must be from allowed letters and also must form a valid word.

Possible word: I G R T H – ""IGRT H"" – no.  
I G B T H – no.  
I G C T H – no.  

This seems impossible. Let me try I _ G T _ with H in position 5.

I _ G T H – positions 1=I, 2=?, 3=G, 4=T, 5=H.  
The missing letter in position 2 must be from allowed letters and form a valid word.

Possible word: I R G T H – no.  
I C G T H – no.  
I B G T H – no.  

This indicates I must have missed a letter. Let me list all constraints again:

Letters in word: I, G, H, T, and one more (not S, L, A, E, P, O, N, M).  
Positions:
- T is in position 4.  
- I is in position 1 or 5.  
- G is not in position 3.  
- H is not in position 4 (already T).  

If I is in position 5: _ _ _ T I  
Then G and H must be in positions 1-3, and one more letter.

Possible word: C H R T I – no.  
B R H T I – no.  
D R H T I – no.  
F R H T I – no.  
G R H T I – no.  

Actually, the word ""RIGHT"" is the only one, but it doesn't fit.

After careful search, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied. From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

This suggests the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with I in position 1:

I R G T H – but this has T in position 4, H in position 5, and I in position 1. This satisfies:
- I in position 1 (not in position 2 or 3)  
- G in position 3 (but MIGHT says G is not in position 3) – this violates.

Thus G cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, G must be in position 1 or 2, and H in position 1,2, or 5.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: G  
- Position 2: H  
- Position 4: T  
- Position 5: I  
- Position 3: must be one more letter from allowed letters.

Valid word: G H _ T I – positions 3 must be a letter forming a word.  
Possible: G H R T I – no.  
G H C T I – no.  
G H B T I – no.  

This seems impossible. Let me try position 1: H, position 2: G:

H G _ T I – positions 3: must be a letter.  
H G R T I – no.  

After exhaustive search, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but rearranged, which indicates I must have made an error.

Realizing the oversight: the word must contain I, G, H, T, and one more letter, with T in position 4, I in position 1 or 5, G not in position 3, H not in position 4 (already T).

The correct word is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, so:

R I G T H – but this has T in position 4 and H in position 5, and I in position 2. From POINT feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3 – this is satisfied (it's in position 2). From MIGHT, I is not in position 2 – this is violated.

This indicates the word must be ""RIGHT"" but with I in position 1:

I R G T H – but this has G in position 3, which violates MIGHT feedback.

Thus, the only possible arrangement is:

G R I T H – positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)  
Check constraints:
- T in position 4 – ✓  
- I in position 3 – but POINT feedback says I is in the word but not in position 3 – this violates.

This is perplexing. Let me try:

H R I T G – but this has T in position 4, I in position 3 – violates.

Finally, the correct arrangement must be:

C H I R T – but this has T in position 5.

Realizing the only possible word is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, which is impossible as it would require T in position 4 and 5.

Thus, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""RIGHT"" but with T in position 4, which is not possible. This suggests an error in earlier steps.

Rechecking: from SLATE, T is in position 4. From POINT, I is in the word but not in position 3. From MIGHT, G and H are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

Thus, the word must be:

_ _ I T _ with I in position 3, but POINT feedback says I is not in position 3. This contradicts.

Ah! Here is the critical error: re-reading POINT feedback carefully:

POINT → P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(x) T(-)

The symbol ""✓"" for I means I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). The symbol ""-"" for T means T is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus, from POINT:
- I is in position 3.  
- T is in the word but not in position 5 (position 4 is already confirmed from SLATE).

Thus the pattern is: _ _ I T _  
Letters known to be absent: S, L, A, E, P, O, N  
Letters known to be in the word: I (position 3), T (position 4), and also G and H (from MIGHT feedback).

Thus the word must contain I, T, G, H, and one more letter, with:
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: T  
- G and H must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
- One more letter is needed.

Possible word: G H I T ? – but position 5 must be a letter, and we have only 5 letters.

Thus the word must be G H I T ? – but this is 4 letters plus one more.

Actually, the word must be 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- 3: I  
- 4: T  
- must contain G and H in 1,2, or 5  
- one more letter.

Possible arrangements:
- G H I T ? – but need 5 letters.  
- G I T H ? – but position 3 is I, so this is G(1), I(2), T(3) – violates position 3 must be I.

Correct pattern: _ _ I T _  
Thus:

Position 1: must be G or H or another letter  
Position 2: must be G or H or another letter  
Position 3: I  
Position 4: T  
Position 5: must be G or H or another letter, but G and H must both appear.

Thus possible words:
- G H I T ? – but need 5 letters.  
- G I T H ? – but position 3 is I, so G(1), I(2), T(3) – violates.

Actually, the word must be:

G R I T H – positions: G(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), H(5)  
Check constraints:
- I in position 3 – ✓ (from POINT)  
- T in position 4 – ✓ (from SLATE)  
- G in position 1 – satisfies G is in word but not in position 3 (from MIGHT)  
- H in position 5 – satisfies H is in word but not in position 4 (from MIGHT)  
- R is the fifth letter, not in forbidden set.

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Contains I (position 3) and T (position 4) – ✓  
- Contains G (position 1) and H (position 5) – ✓  
- No S, L, A, E, P, O, N – ✓  
- G not in position 3 – ✓  
- H not in position 4 – ✓  

Thus, the correct next guess is ""G R I T H"".Based on the accumulated constraints, the only valid word that fits all the feedback is ""GRITH"".",Guess 4: GRITH -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) I(✓) T(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
