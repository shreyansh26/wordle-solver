### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Uses letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd).
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th).

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S
- Letters definitely present: O, E
- O cannot be in position 3; E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Contains both O and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Let me think of possible placements:
- O could be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- E could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O and E.
- Doesn’t use A, R, or S (but wait, it does use A – bad).
Next candidate: “OFTEN” – uses F, T, N; but E is in position 5 (invalid).
Next: “TONEY” – uses T, N, Y; O is 2nd, E is 4th. This seems valid.

But let me double-check:
- T, O, N, E, Y – no A, R, or S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

Yes, “TONEY” looks like a strong second guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Uses letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd).
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th).

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S
- Letters definitely present: O, E
- O cannot be in position 3; E cannot be in position 5.

I need a new word that:
1. Contains both O and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Let me think of possible placements:
- O could be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- E could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O and E.
- Doesn’t use A, R, or S (but wait, it does use A – bad).
Next candidate: “OFTEN” – uses F, T, N; but E is in position 5 (invalid).
Next: “TONEY” – uses T, N, Y; O is 2nd, E is 4th. This seems valid.

But let me double-check:
- T, O, N, E, Y – no A, R, or S.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

Yes, “TONEY” looks like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, T  
Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:  
- O is in position 2  
- N is in position 3  
- E is in position 4  
- Y is in position 5  

So the pattern so far is: _ O N E Y

The only missing letter is the first character.  
It must be a consonant that has not yet been ruled out (i.e., not A, R, S, T).  
Common consonants still available include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

A quick check of valid 5-letter words ending in ONEY gives us a limited set.  
The most common and likely word is “CONEY,” but C has not been tested yet.  
Another possibility is “PONEY,” but “PONEY” is less common.  
“CONEY” is a recognized word (a type of rabbit) and uses C, which has not appeared in any guess.

Therefore, “CONEY” is the logical next guess.

We now know the exact pattern: _ O N E Y  
and we have eliminated the following starting letters:  
A, R, S, T, C, H.

Still-valid consonants for the first position include:  
B, D, F, G, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Common 5-letter words ending in “ONEY” are rare, but one standard word is “DONEY” (a variant spelling of “dooney,” though it is uncommon). A more likely candidate is “PONEY,” but that is archaic. Another possibility is “GONEY,” which is not standard. The only remaining plausible common word is “BONEY,” but it is also not in most dictionaries.

However, “LONEY” is not recognized. “MONDY” is incorrect. Rechecking, the only standard word ending in “ONEY” is “HONEY,” which we have already tried and ruled out.

This suggests we may have missed a simpler path earlier. Let me re-examine the feedback:

- The confirmed positions are O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5).  
- Therefore the word is of the form: ? O N E Y.

Looking at Scrabble word lists, the valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is “PONEY” (obsolete) and “BONEY” (slang). Neither is ideal. The only modern word is “HONEY,” which we have already ruled out.

This implies we may have an inconsistency. However, upon closer inspection, the word “ONEY” is typically 4 letters. The 5-letter word must be “PONEY” (as in “pony express”), but that is 5 letters.

Rechecking:  
- P has not been tested yet.  
- “PONEY” is a valid word (though rare).

Thus, the next logical guess is “PONEY.”
