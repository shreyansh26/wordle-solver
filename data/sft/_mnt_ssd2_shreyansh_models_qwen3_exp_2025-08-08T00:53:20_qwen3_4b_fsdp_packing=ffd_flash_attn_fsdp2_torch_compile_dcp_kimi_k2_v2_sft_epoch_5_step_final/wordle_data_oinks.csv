For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common letters to test as many as possible. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- DOES contain N, but not in the 4th position.

I now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STONE (but contains E, which we know is absent)
- SOUND (but contains U, O, D - good letters)
- SLUMP (but contains U, M, P - but no N)
- STING (but contains I, N, G - and N is in position 3, which is allowed)

Let me pick a word that uses N in a different position and tests new common letters. ""STING"" has N in position 3, and tests S, T, I, G. But I need to ensure N isn't in position 4 - it's fine here.

Wait, but ""STING"" has N in position 3, which is allowed. However, I might prefer a word that places N in position 2 or 5 to narrow down possibilities further.

Another option: ""BLUNT"" - but contains U and T, and N is in position 4 (forbidden by feedback).

""PLUMB"" - but contains U, M, B, and N is in position 3 (allowed), but this seems less common.

""STONY"" - contains O, N, Y, and N is in position 3 (allowed). This seems good as it tests S, T, O, Y with N in position 3.

But ""STONY"" has N in position 3 - which is allowed. However, I might prefer to test N in position 2 or 5.

""UNTIL"" - but contains U, N, T, I, L - N is in position 2 (allowed), and tests U, T, I, L.

This seems like a strong choice - it tests N in position 2, plus U, T, I, L.

But let me think of simpler words. ""DUNNO"" - but repeats N, and has O.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T - N in position 2 (allowed), and tests S, O, U, T.

This seems good - all new letters except N which we know is present.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: N, S, O (each marked “-”, so they appear somewhere but not in the positions tried so far)

Positions ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or position 2 (from SNOUT).
- S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT).
- O cannot be in position 3 (from SNOUT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N, S, O (each at least once).
2. Places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
5. Uses only letters not on the “x” list (no C, R, A, E, U, T).

Remaining common letters we can still test: I, L, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

A promising candidate is “SONIC” but it contains C (forbidden) and I is untested.  
Another is “SNOLY” but Y is uncommon and we haven’t tested L yet.

Let’s try “SNOWY”:
- Contains S, N, O (all required).
- N is in position 2 → but we already know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback). So this fails.

Next try “SNIPS” – but repeats S and P is untested; also N would be in position 2 again.

Try “SHOWN”:
- Letters: S, H, O, W, N → contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT). So this fails.

Try “HONDS” (H, O, N, D, S):
- Contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters H and D.

This seems valid and tests two new letters (H, D) while satisfying all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “HONDS”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common letters to test as many as possible. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- DOES contain N, but not in the 4th position.

I now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STONE (but contains E, which we know is absent)
- SOUND (but contains U, O, D - good letters)
- SLUMP (but contains U, M, P - but no N)
- STING (but contains I, N, G - and N is in position 3, which is allowed)

Let me pick a word that uses N in a different position and tests new common letters. ""STING"" has N in position 3, and tests S, T, I, G. But I need to ensure N isn't in position 4 - it's fine here.

Wait, but ""STING"" has N in position 3, which is allowed. However, I might prefer a word that places N in position 2 or 5 to narrow down possibilities further.

Another option: ""BLUNT"" - but contains U and T, and N is in position 4 (forbidden by feedback).

""PLUMB"" - but contains U, M, B, and N is in position 3 (allowed), but this seems less common.

""STONY"" - contains O, N, Y, and N is in position 3 (allowed). This seems good as it tests S, T, O, Y with N in position 3.

But ""STONY"" has N in position 3 - which is allowed. However, I might prefer to test N in position 2 or 5.

""UNTIL"" - but contains U, N, T, I, L - N is in position 2 (allowed), and tests U, T, I, L.

This seems like a strong choice - it tests N in position 2, plus U, T, I, L.

But let me think of simpler words. ""DUNNO"" - but repeats N, and has O.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T - N in position 2 (allowed), and tests S, O, U, T.

This seems good - all new letters except N which we know is present.

I'll go with ""SNOUT"" as it tests S, N, O, U, T - all new letters except N which we know is in the word (in position 2 this time).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: N, S, O (each marked “-”, so they appear somewhere but not in the positions tried so far)

Positions ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or position 2 (from SNOUT).
- S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT).
- O cannot be in position 3 (from SNOUT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N, S, O (each at least once).
2. Places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
5. Uses only letters not on the “x” list (no C, R, A, E, U, T).

Remaining common letters we can still test: I, L, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

A promising candidate is “SONIC” but it contains C (forbidden) and I is untested.  
Another is “SNOLY” but Y is uncommon and we haven’t tested L yet.

Let’s try “SNOWY”:
- Contains S, N, O (all required).
- N is in position 2 → but we already know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback). So this fails.

Next try “SNIPS” – but repeats S and P is untested; also N would be in position 2 again.

Try “SHOWN”:
- Letters: S, H, O, W, N → contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT). So this fails.

Try “HONDS” (H, O, N, D, S):
- Contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters H and D.

This seems valid and tests two new letters (H, D) while satisfying all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “HONDS”.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – N is in position 3.
  – S is in position 5.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
  – O is somewhere, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3 and S in position 5.
2. Contains O somewhere (not in position 2).
3. Uses only letters not on the forbidden list (no C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D).

The word structure so far: _ _ N _ S

Possible remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones): B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need to place O in positions 1 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2, 3, or 5).

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ N _ S
  – Possible: ONIPS, ONKLS, etc. But need valid 5-letter words.
- If O is in position 4: _ _ N O S
  – Possible: BONUS, FONOS, GONOS, etc.

Looking at valid English words:
- BONUS: B, O, N, U, S → but U is forbidden (from SNOUT feedback).
- FONOS: Not a valid English word.
- GONOS: Not valid.
- LONUS: Not valid.
- PONUS: Not valid.
- VONUS: Not valid.
- WONUS: Not valid.
- YONUS: Not valid.

Next, check position 1 for O:
- ONIPS: Not a word.
- ONKLS: Not a word.
- ONGYS: Not a word.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 4.

Looking at _ _ N O S:
- B, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y are still allowed.

Possible words:
- B, I, N, O, S → BIONS? Not valid.
- L, I, N, O, S → LIONS – but O would be in position 4, which is allowed.
- M, I, N, O, S → MINOS – valid.
- P, I, N, O, S → PINOS – valid.
- V, I, N, O, S → VINOS – valid.
- W, I, N, O, S → WINOS – valid.
- Y, I, N, O, S → YINOS – not valid.

Among these, LIONS, MINOS, PINOS, VINOS, WINOS are all valid 5-letter English words.

Let’s pick LIONS as it’s a common word and uses I (a new letter we haven’t tested).

Check constraints:
- L, I, O, N, S.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in position 4 (not 2, ✓).

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(✓) → N is in the word and in position 3 (exact match).
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 5 (exact match).

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D.
- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – N is in position 3.
  – S is in position 5.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
  – O is somewhere, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3 and S in position 5.
2. Contains O somewhere (not in position 2).
3. Uses only letters not on the forbidden list (no C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D).

The word structure so far: _ _ N _ S

Possible remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones): B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need to place O in positions 1 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2, 3, or 5).

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ N _ S
  – Possible: ONIPS, ONKLS, etc. But need valid 5-letter words.
- If O is in position 4: _ _ N O S
  – Possible: BONUS, FONOS, GONOS, etc.

Looking at valid English words:
- BONUS: B, O, N, U, S → but U is forbidden (from SNOUT feedback).
- FONOS: Not a valid English word.
- GONOS: Not valid.
- LONUS: Not valid.
- PONUS: Not valid.
- VONUS: Not valid.
- WONUS: Not valid.
- YONUS: Not valid.

Next, check position 1 for O:
- ONIPS: Not a word.
- ONKLS: Not a word.
- ONGYS: Not a word.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 4.

Looking at _ _ N O S:
- B, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y are still allowed.

Possible words:
- B, I, N, O, S → BIONS? Not valid.
- L, I, N, O, S → LIONS – but O would be in position 4, which is allowed.
- M, I, N, O, S → MINOS – valid.
- P, I, N, O, S → PINOS – valid.
- V, I, N, O, S → VINOS – valid.
- W, I, N, O, S → WINOS – valid.
- Y, I, N, O, S → YINOS – not valid.

Among these, LIONS, MINOS, PINOS, VINOS, WINOS are all valid 5-letter English words.

Let’s pick LIONS as it’s a common word and uses I (a new letter we haven’t tested).

Check constraints:
- L, I, O, N, S.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in position 4 (not 2, ✓).
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D) are present.

Therefore, LIONS is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Forbidden letters (never appear): C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D, L  
Confirmed letters and positions:  
- N is in position 3 (from HONDS)  
- S is in position 5 (from HONDS)  

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:  
- O (must appear, but not in positions 2, 3, 5)  
- I (must appear, and we know from LIONS it is in position 2)  

So the word looks like: _ I N _ S and it must contain an additional O somewhere.  
Possible positions for O: only 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5).  

Structure options:  
1. O I N _ S  → O I N ? S (only position 4 unknown)  
2. _ I N O S  → ? I N O S (only position 1 unknown)  

Letters still allowed (not forbidden and not yet placed): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O (already required).  

Check valid English words:  
- Option 1: O I N ? S → OIN?S.  No common 5-letter words fit.  
- Option 2: ? I N O S → ?INOS.  Valid words:  
  – B, M, P, V, W, Y can precede “INOS”.  
  – B + INOS = B INOS → “BINOS” (valid slang/brand name, but not standard).  
  – M + INOS = MINOS (valid proper noun/brand, but generally accepted).  
  – P + INOS = PINOS (valid Spanish-derived word for “pins”).  
  – V + INOS = VINOS (valid Spanish-derived word for “wines”).  
  – W + INOS = WINOS (valid slang).  

Among these, “MINOS” is the clearest standard English word.  
It uses:  
- M (new, allowed)  
- I (✓ in position 2)  
- N (✓ in position 3)  
- O (✓, in position 4)  
- S (✓ in position 5)  

No forbidden letters appear, and all constraints are satisfied.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct, common letters to test as many as possible. 

Some good starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, E.
- DOES contain N, but not in the 4th position.

I now want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STONE (but contains E, which we know is absent)
- SOUND (but contains U, O, D - good letters)
- SLUMP (but contains U, M, P - but no N)
- STING (but contains I, N, G - and N is in position 3, which is allowed)

Let me pick a word that uses N in a different position and tests new common letters. ""STING"" has N in position 3, and tests S, T, I, G. But I need to ensure N isn't in position 4 - it's fine here.

Wait, but ""STING"" has N in position 3, which is allowed. However, I might prefer a word that places N in position 2 or 5 to narrow down possibilities further.

Another option: ""BLUNT"" - but contains U and T, and N is in position 4 (forbidden by feedback).

""PLUMB"" - but contains U, M, B, and N is in position 3 (allowed), but this seems less common.

""STONY"" - contains O, N, Y, and N is in position 3 (allowed). This seems good as it tests S, T, O, Y with N in position 3.

But ""STONY"" has N in position 3 - which is allowed. However, I might prefer to test N in position 2 or 5.

""UNTIL"" - but contains U, N, T, I, L - N is in position 2 (allowed), and tests U, T, I, L.

This seems like a strong choice - it tests N in position 2, plus U, T, I, L.

But let me think of simpler words. ""DUNNO"" - but repeats N, and has O.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T - N in position 2 (allowed), and tests S, O, U, T.

This seems good - all new letters except N which we know is present.

I'll go with ""SNOUT"" as it tests S, N, O, U, T - all new letters except N which we know is in the word (in position 2 this time).

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: N, S, O (each marked “-”, so they appear somewhere but not in the positions tried so far)

Positions ruled out:
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRANE) or position 2 (from SNOUT).
- S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT).
- O cannot be in position 3 (from SNOUT).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N, S, O (each at least once).
2. Places N somewhere other than positions 2 or 4.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
5. Uses only letters not on the “x” list (no C, R, A, E, U, T).

Remaining common letters we can still test: I, L, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

A promising candidate is “SONIC” but it contains C (forbidden) and I is untested.  
Another is “SNOLY” but Y is uncommon and we haven’t tested L yet.

Let’s try “SNOWY”:
- Contains S, N, O (all required).
- N is in position 2 → but we already know N cannot be in position 2 (from SNOUT feedback). So this fails.

Next try “SNIPS” – but repeats S and P is untested; also N would be in position 2 again.

Try “SHOWN”:
- Letters: S, H, O, W, N → contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 5 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 → but we know S cannot be in position 1 (from SNOUT). So this fails.

Try “HONDS” (H, O, N, D, S):
- Contains S, O, N.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Uses new letters H and D.

This seems valid and tests two new letters (H, D) while satisfying all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “HONDS”.

- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So far we know:

- Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
  – N is in position 3.
  – S is in position 5.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
  – O is somewhere, but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3 and S in position 5.
2. Contains O somewhere (not in position 2).
3. Uses only letters not on the forbidden list (no C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D).

The word structure so far: _ _ N _ S

Possible remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones): B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O.

We need to place O in positions 1 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2, 3, or 5).

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ N _ S
  – Possible: ONIPS, ONKLS, etc. But need valid 5-letter words.
- If O is in position 4: _ _ N O S
  – Possible: BONUS, FONOS, GONOS, etc.

Looking at valid English words:
- BONUS: B, O, N, U, S → but U is forbidden (from SNOUT feedback).
- FONOS: Not a valid English word.
- GONOS: Not valid.
- LONUS: Not valid.
- PONUS: Not valid.
- VONUS: Not valid.
- WONUS: Not valid.
- YONUS: Not valid.

Next, check position 1 for O:
- ONIPS: Not a word.
- ONKLS: Not a word.
- ONGYS: Not a word.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 4.

Looking at _ _ N O S:
- B, I, L, M, P, V, W, Y are still allowed.

Possible words:
- B, I, N, O, S → BIONS? Not valid.
- L, I, N, O, S → LIONS – but O would be in position 4, which is allowed.
- M, I, N, O, S → MINOS – valid.
- P, I, N, O, S → PINOS – valid.
- V, I, N, O, S → VINOS – valid.
- W, I, N, O, S → WINOS – valid.
- Y, I, N, O, S → YINOS – not valid.

Among these, LIONS, MINOS, PINOS, VINOS, WINOS are all valid 5-letter English words.

Let’s pick LIONS as it’s a common word and uses I (a new letter we haven’t tested).

Check constraints:
- L, I, O, N, S.
- N is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in position 4 (not 2, ✓).
- No forbidden letters (C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D) are present.

Therefore, LIONS is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Forbidden letters (never appear): C, R, A, E, U, T, H, D, L  
Confirmed letters and positions:  
- N is in position 3 (from HONDS)  
- S is in position 5 (from HONDS)  

Confirmed letters but unknown positions:  
- O (must appear, but not in positions 2, 3, 5)  
- I (must appear, and we know from LIONS it is in position 2)  

So the word looks like: _ I N _ S and it must contain an additional O somewhere.  
Possible positions for O: only 1 or 4 (cannot be 2,3,5).  

Structure options:  
1. O I N _ S  → O I N ? S (only position 4 unknown)  
2. _ I N O S  → ? I N O S (only position 1 unknown)  

Letters still allowed (not forbidden and not yet placed): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus O (already required).  

Check valid English words:  
- Option 1: O I N ? S → OIN?S.  No common 5-letter words fit.  
- Option 2: ? I N O S → ?INOS.  Valid words:  
  – B, M, P, V, W, Y can precede “INOS”.  
  – B + INOS = B INOS → “BINOS” (valid slang/brand name, but not standard).  
  – M + INOS = MINOS (valid proper noun/brand, but generally accepted).  
  – P + INOS = PINOS (valid Spanish-derived word for “pins”).  
  – V + INOS = VINOS (valid Spanish-derived word for “wines”).  
  – W + INOS = WINOS (valid slang).  

Among these, “MINOS” is the clearest standard English word.  
It uses:  
- M (new, allowed)  
- I (✓ in position 2)  
- N (✓ in position 3)  
- O (✓, in position 4)  
- S (✓ in position 5)  

No forbidden letters appear, and all constraints are satisfied.
