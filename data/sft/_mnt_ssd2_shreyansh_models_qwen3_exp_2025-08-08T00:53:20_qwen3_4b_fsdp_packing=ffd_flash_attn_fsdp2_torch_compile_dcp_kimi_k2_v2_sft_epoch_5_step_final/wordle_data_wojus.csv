For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the first position).

A strong candidate is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters we haven’t tested yet.

From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (again).
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

3. POISK → P(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - P, I, K are not in the word.
   - O is in position 2 and is correct there.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R, N, P, I, K
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4.
- O is fixed in position 2.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: U (since O is already used, and A, E, I are out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- S somewhere in positions 3, 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded)
- Only letters from the remaining list.

Let’s try to form such a word.

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _

We need to place S in 3 or 5, and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Option 1: S in position 3
   _ O S _ _

Option 2: S in position 5
   _ O _ _ S

Let’s explore Option 1 first: _ O S _ _

We need two consonants from the remaining list (B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A common pattern might be to use consonants that form a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B O S _ _ → ""BOSMS"" is invalid (repeated S)
- B O S _ _ → ""BOSIS"" invalid (I is out)
- C O S _ _ → ""COSMS"" invalid
- D O S _ _ → ""DOSIS"" invalid
- F O S _ _ → ""FOSFS"" invalid
- G O S _ _ → ""GOSAS"" invalid (A is out)
- M O S _ _ → ""MOSMS"" invalid
- V O S _ _ → ""VOSVS"" invalid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let’s try Option 2: _ O _ _ S

We need three consonants from the remaining list, with O in position 2 and S in position 5.

Possible words:
- B O _ _ S → ""BOBBS"" invalid
- C O _ _ S → ""COBBS"" invalid
- D O _ _ S → ""DOUBS"" – but U is a vowel, and we can use U since it's not excluded
   - ""DOUBS"" is a valid word (variant spelling of ""doubt"" in some contexts)
- F O _ _ S → ""FOGGS"" invalid
- G O _ _ S → ""GOFFS"" invalid
- M O _ _ S → ""MOBBS"" invalid
- V O _ _ S → ""VOGGS"" invalid

""DOUBS"" seems the closest, but let me check if U is allowed – yes, U is a vowel not yet excluded.

However, ""DOUBS"" might be obscure. Let me think of others.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 3.

Let’s try ""BOSSY"":
- B, O, S, S, Y
- But S is repeated, and we don't know if S appears once or more.
- Also Y is allowed.

But ""BOSSY"" has S in positions 3 and 4 – but we only know S is in the word, not how many times.

""BOSSY"" might be acceptable, but let's see if we can find a better one.

""MOSSY"" – same issue.

""FOSSA"" – A is out.

""VOGUE"" – E is out.

""BOVSS"" – invalid.

""BOGUS"" – U is allowed, G is allowed, but S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""BOGUS"" has:
- B (allowed)
- O (correct position 2)
- G (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- S (allowed in position 5)

This seems valid.

""BOGUS"" is a common word.

Let me verify:
- Letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the excluded letters.
- O is in position 2 – confirmed correct.
- S is in position 5 – allowed (not excluded by previous feedback).
- No S in positions 1 or 4 – correct.

This seems like a good guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- O is locked in position 2.
- S must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- We’ve eliminated many letters, leaving us with a narrow set of possible consonants.

The word “BOGUS” fits all constraints:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Uses only remaining allowed letters (B, G, U, S).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first letter).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the first position).
2. Excludes L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let’s try a word that places S in a different position and uses other common letters.  
A strong candidate is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids L, A, T, E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters and the correct placement of S.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (again).
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, O
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R, N
- S cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and O.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E, H, R, N.
- S is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Let’s list possible letters left:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, O, U (O is already known to be present)

We need to place S and O, and fill the other three slots with remaining letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 2 (since it can’t be in 3).  
Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

A promising word is “SPOIL”:
- S in position 1 – but we know S can’t be in position 1.  
So “SPOIL” is invalid.

Next try “POISK”:
- P, O, I, S, K – none of the forbidden letters (L,A,T,E,H,R,N).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems valid. Let’s check:
Letters: P, O, I, S, K – all allowed.
Positions: S not in 1, O not in 3 – both satisfied.

“POISK” is a valid 5-letter word (means “to search” in some languages, or a surname).  
It gives us new letters P, I, K to test.

Let’s update what we now know after the four guesses.

4. The remaining alphabet letters that have not been tried are:

Remaining consonants: C, D, F, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning for common 5-letter English words that fit C O _ U S, D O _ U S, F O _ U S, etc., the only plausible candidate is:

C O M U S  → “COMUS” (an archaic or poetic spelling of “commus”, a religious society; also appears in “The Rape of the Lock” by Alexander Pope).  
D O M U S  → “DOMUS” (Latin for house, often used in English contexts).  
F O M U S  → “FOMUS” (rare).

Among these, “COMUS” and “DOMUS” are both valid English 5-letter words.  
“COMUS” is slightly more common in modern English usage (as a name or in literature), so I’ll choose that.

All letters in “COMUS” are still allowed:
C, O, M, U, S – none have been marked “x”.
Positions:
- O is fixed at 2 (✓)
- U is fixed at 4 (✓)
- S is fixed at 5 (✓)
- C and M are new and allowed.

Therefore, “COMUS” is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can get about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Some common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first letter).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in the first position).
2. Excludes L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let’s try a word that places S in a different position and uses other common letters.  
A strong candidate is “SHORN”:
- S is in position 2 (different from position 1).
- H, O, R, N are all common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- It avoids L, A, T, E.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters and the correct placement of S.

Guess 2: SHORN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word.

2. SHORN → S(-) H(x) O(-) R(x) N(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1 (again).
   - H, R, N are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: S, O
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R, N
- S cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and O.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E, H, R, N.
- S is not in position 1.
- O is not in position 3.

Let’s list possible letters left:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, O, U (O is already known to be present)

We need to place S and O, and fill the other three slots with remaining letters.

Let’s try to place O in position 2 (since it can’t be in 3).  
Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

A promising word is “SPOIL”:
- S in position 1 – but we know S can’t be in position 1.  
So “SPOIL” is invalid.

Next try “POISK”:
- P, O, I, S, K – none of the forbidden letters (L,A,T,E,H,R,N).
- S is in position 4 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems valid. Let’s check:
Letters: P, O, I, S, K – all allowed.
Positions: S not in 1, O not in 3 – both satisfied.

“POISK” is a valid 5-letter word (means “to search” in some languages, or a surname).  
It gives us new letters P, I, K to test.

So we’ll guess POISK.

From the three guesses we have:

3. POISK → P(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - P, I, K are not in the word.
   - O is in position 2 and is correct there.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O (position 2), S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R, N, P, I, K
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4.
- O is fixed in position 2.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: U (since O is already used, and A, E, I are out)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- S somewhere in positions 3, 5 (since 1 and 4 are excluded)
- Only letters from the remaining list.

Let’s try to form such a word.

Possible structure: _ O _ _ _

We need to place S in 3 or 5, and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Option 1: S in position 3
   _ O S _ _

Option 2: S in position 5
   _ O _ _ S

Let’s explore Option 1 first: _ O S _ _

We need two consonants from the remaining list (B, C, D, F, G, J, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A common pattern might be to use consonants that form a valid word.

Let’s try:
- B O S _ _ → ""BOSMS"" is invalid (repeated S)
- B O S _ _ → ""BOSIS"" invalid (I is out)
- C O S _ _ → ""COSMS"" invalid
- D O S _ _ → ""DOSIS"" invalid
- F O S _ _ → ""FOSFS"" invalid
- G O S _ _ → ""GOSAS"" invalid (A is out)
- M O S _ _ → ""MOSMS"" invalid
- V O S _ _ → ""VOSVS"" invalid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let’s try Option 2: _ O _ _ S

We need three consonants from the remaining list, with O in position 2 and S in position 5.

Possible words:
- B O _ _ S → ""BOBBS"" invalid
- C O _ _ S → ""COBBS"" invalid
- D O _ _ S → ""DOUBS"" – but U is a vowel, and we can use U since it's not excluded
   - ""DOUBS"" is a valid word (variant spelling of ""doubt"" in some contexts)
- F O _ _ S → ""FOGGS"" invalid
- G O _ _ S → ""GOFFS"" invalid
- M O _ _ S → ""MOBBS"" invalid
- V O _ _ S → ""VOGGS"" invalid

""DOUBS"" seems the closest, but let me check if U is allowed – yes, U is a vowel not yet excluded.

However, ""DOUBS"" might be obscure. Let me think of others.

Another approach: maybe S is in position 3.

Let’s try ""BOSSY"":
- B, O, S, S, Y
- But S is repeated, and we don't know if S appears once or more.
- Also Y is allowed.

But ""BOSSY"" has S in positions 3 and 4 – but we only know S is in the word, not how many times.

""BOSSY"" might be acceptable, but let's see if we can find a better one.

""MOSSY"" – same issue.

""FOSSA"" – A is out.

""VOGUE"" – E is out.

""BOVSS"" – invalid.

""BOGUS"" – U is allowed, G is allowed, but S is in position 5, which is allowed.

""BOGUS"" has:
- B (allowed)
- O (correct position 2)
- G (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- S (allowed in position 5)

This seems valid.

""BOGUS"" is a common word.

Let me verify:
- Letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the excluded letters.
- O is in position 2 – confirmed correct.
- S is in position 5 – allowed (not excluded by previous feedback).
- No S in positions 1 or 4 – correct.

This seems like a good guess.Based on the feedback so far:
- O is locked in position 2.
- S must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- We’ve eliminated many letters, leaving us with a narrow set of possible consonants.

The word “BOGUS” fits all constraints:
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Uses only remaining allowed letters (B, G, U, S).

“COMUS” is slightly more common in modern English usage (as a name or in literature), so I’ll choose that.

All letters in “COMUS” are still allowed:
C, O, M, U, S – none have been marked “x”.
Positions:
- O is fixed at 2 (✓)
- U is fixed at 4 (✓)
- S is fixed at 5 (✓)
- C and M are new and allowed.

Therefore, “COMUS” is the logical next guess.

- Position 4 is U.
- Position 5 is S.
- Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, H, R, N, P, I, K, B, G, C, M.

So the word must be of the form: _  O  _  U  S

The only letters left that have not been tried for position 3 are:
D, F, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a common English 5-letter word that fits D O _ U S, F O _ U S, etc., the only one that comes up is:

D O U B S  → ""DOUBS"" (a Scottish term for a narrow ravine or a variant spelling of ""doubt"")

All letters in ""DOUBS"" are still allowed:
- D, O, U, B, S.
- B was only confirmed in BOGUS (B was marked x, but that was before we placed O, U, S correctly; we have no record of B being ruled out in the later positions).
Wait - let me double-check elimination status:

From BOGUS: B(x) - this means B is not in the word at all. So B is eliminated.

So remaining consonants for position 3: D, F, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English word among those starting with DO_ US is ""DOUBS"" but B is eliminated.

Next possible: F O _ U S - ""FOGUS"" (a type of fungus, but G is eliminated).

J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z don't form common words with O _ U S.

But ""DOUBS"" is invalid because B is eliminated.

However, ""DOUSY"" is quite archaic. 

Another option: ""DOUSY"" vs ""DOUS"" (but needs to be 5 letters).

Actually, ""DOUSY"" is the only common 5-letter word left.

But let me check ""VOUS"" - but that's 4 letters.

Wait - let me think systematically:

We need _ O _ U S with remaining consonants for position 3: D, F, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English 5-letter words from these:
