### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   – Eliminates: L, I, M, Y  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

3. STUNK → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – Eliminates: N, K  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known) nor position 4.  
   – T and U are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word must:
- Contain S, T, U  
- NOT contain: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, N, K  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- T and U cannot be in their guessed positions (2 and 3 respectively)

Remaining letters to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
We need a 5-letter word using S, T, U plus two other allowed letters, with S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Possible placements:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _ (T and U must go elsewhere)  
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _ (T and U must go elsewhere)  
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S (T and U must go elsewhere)

Looking for common patterns, let’s try S in position 2 and arrange T and U around it.

Candidate: “STUDY” – but Y is eliminated.  
Next: “STUMP” – M and P: M is eliminated.  
Next: “STUFF” – F is allowed, but double F may not help much.  
Next: “STUDY” again – Y eliminated.  
Next: “STUDS” – repeats S, not helpful.  
Next: “STUBS” – B is allowed, but double S.

Better: “STUBS” is invalid (B in position 3, S in 5).  
Another: “STUCC” – C is allowed, but double C.

Let’s try “STUDY” replacement: “STUDS” – invalid.  
Another approach: “STU” as root plus two new letters.  
“STU” + D + B = “STUBD” – not a word.  
“STU” + C + H = “STUCH” – not a word.  
“STU” + D + G = “STUDG” – not a word.

Let’s try S in position 3: _ _ S _ _  
We need T and U in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, not 2 or 3.  
Possible word: “DUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“CUSTO” – O eliminated.  
“PUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“BUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“HUSTY” – not a word.

Another pattern: S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S  
Then T and U must be in positions 1-3.  
Possible word: “UTENS” – N eliminated.  
“TUBES” – B and E: E eliminated.  
“TUDOS” – O eliminated.  
“TUSKS” – K eliminated.  
“TURDS” – R and D: R eliminated.  
“TUSHY” – H and Y: Y eliminated.  
“TUSTY” – not a word.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S _ _ _  
We need T and U elsewhere (positions 3,4,5), not 2 or 3.  
Possible word: “BUSTS” – B allowed, S in 2, U in 3, S repeats.  
“CUSTS” – same issue.  
“DUSTS” – same.  
“FUSTS” – not a word.  
“GUSTS” – G allowed, U in 3, S in 2, T in 4.  
“GUSTS” is a valid word: G, U, S, T, S.  
It uses S, T, U and G.  
S is in position 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), U in 3 (allowed).  
All letters are from the allowed set.

Thus, “GUSTS” is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4)
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

A strong next guess would be ""SLIMY"":
- Contains S (not in position 4)
- Uses I and Y (common letters)
- Uses L and M (common consonants)
- Does not use any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E)

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): S (from both guesses, but never in position 4 or 1)

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but S is not in position 1 or 4)
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (in position 2, 3, or 5)
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good candidate letters: T, N, D, C, H, K, U, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STUNK"":
- Contains S in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses T, U, N, K (all allowed)
- Common word that gives info on multiple letters

Let me double-check:
- S is allowed (not in positions 1 or 4)
- T, U, N, K are not in the eliminated list
- ""STUNK"" is a valid 5-letter word

From the latest feedback on GUSTS:

- G (x) – G is NOT in the word.
- U (✓) – U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).

- T (✓) – T is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 4).
- S (✓) – S is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 5).

So we now know:

1. Positions:
   - 2 = U
   - 4 = T
   - 5 = S
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, N, K, G
3. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z
4. The word pattern is: _ U _ T S

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ U _ T S and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B U T T S – invalid (double T)
- C U T T S – invalid

None of the above work because they all have double T. Let’s look for words with a different consonant in position 3.

The pattern is: ? U ? T S

We need a letter for position 3 that is not yet eliminated and doesn’t create a double letter. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback shows S is in position 5, T in 4, U in 2. So the word is: ? U ? T S

Looking at valid English words ending in ""UTS"", but with U in position 2, T in 4, S in 5.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words matching the pattern _ U _ T S:

- BUSTS – but B is allowed, U in 2, S in 5, T in 4. This fits all constraints.
- CUSTS – but C is allowed, same positions.
- DUSTS – D is allowed.
- FUSTS – F is allowed.
- HUSTS – H is allowed.
- JUSTS – J is allowed.
- PUSTS – P is allowed.
- VUSTS – V is allowed.
- WUSTS – W is allowed.
- XUSTS – X is allowed.
- ZUSTS – Z is allowed.

All of these are valid, but ""BUSTS"" is the most common word. Let me check if any of these have eliminated letters:

- BUSTS: B, U, S, T, S – all letters are allowed (B is allowed, U is allowed, S is allowed, T is allowed).
- CUSTS: C, U, S, T, S – C is allowed.
- DUSTS: D is allowed.
- etc.

All fit. The most common and likely is ""BUSTS"".

</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- U is in position 2
- T is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, N, K, G

The word must be _ U _ T S. The most common valid word fitting this pattern is:

- G (x) – G is NOT in the word.
- U (✓) – U is in the word and in the CORRECT position (position 2).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but S is not in the 4th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4)
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

A strong next guess would be ""SLIMY"":
- Contains S (not in position 4)
- Uses I and Y (common letters)
- Uses L and M (common consonants)
- Does not use any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): S (from both guesses, but never in position 4 or 1)

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but S is not in position 1 or 4)
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S (in position 2, 3, or 5)
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good candidate letters: T, N, D, C, H, K, U, etc.

A strong next guess would be ""STUNK"":
- Contains S in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses T, U, N, K (all allowed)
- Common word that gives info on multiple letters

Let me double-check:
- S is allowed (not in positions 1 or 4)
- T, U, N, K are not in the eliminated list
- ""STUNK"" is a valid 5-letter word

Guess 3: STUNK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the three guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates: A, R, O, E  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   – Eliminates: L, I, M, Y  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.

3. STUNK → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – Eliminates: N, K  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known) nor position 4.  
   – T and U are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word must:
- Contain S, T, U  
- NOT contain: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, N, K  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- T and U cannot be in their guessed positions (2 and 3 respectively)

Remaining letters to work with: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
We need a 5-letter word using S, T, U plus two other allowed letters, with S in position 2, 3, or 5.

Possible placements:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _ (T and U must go elsewhere)  
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _ (T and U must go elsewhere)  
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S (T and U must go elsewhere)

Looking for common patterns, let’s try S in position 2 and arrange T and U around it.

Candidate: “STUDY” – but Y is eliminated.  
Next: “STUMP” – M and P: M is eliminated.  
Next: “STUFF” – F is allowed, but double F may not help much.  
Next: “STUDY” again – Y eliminated.  
Next: “STUDS” – repeats S, not helpful.  
Next: “STUBS” – B is allowed, but double S.

Better: “STUBS” is invalid (B in position 3, S in 5).  
Another: “STUCC” – C is allowed, but double C.

Let’s try “STUDY” replacement: “STUDS” – invalid.  
Another approach: “STU” as root plus two new letters.  
“STU” + D + B = “STUBD” – not a word.  
“STU” + C + H = “STUCH” – not a word.  
“STU” + D + G = “STUDG” – not a word.

Let’s try S in position 3: _ _ S _ _  
We need T and U in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, not 2 or 3.  
Possible word: “DUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“CUSTO” – O eliminated.  
“PUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“BUSTY” – Y eliminated.  
“HUSTY” – not a word.

Another pattern: S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S  
Then T and U must be in positions 1-3.  
Possible word: “UTENS” – N eliminated.  
“TUBES” – B and E: E eliminated.  
“TUDOS” – O eliminated.  
“TUSKS” – K eliminated.  
“TURDS” – R and D: R eliminated.  
“TUSHY” – H and Y: Y eliminated.  
“TUSTY” – not a word.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S _ _ _  
We need T and U elsewhere (positions 3,4,5), not 2 or 3.  
Possible word: “BUSTS” – B allowed, S in 2, U in 3, S repeats.  
“CUSTS” – same issue.  
“DUSTS” – same.  
“FUSTS” – not a word.  
“GUSTS” – G allowed, U in 3, S in 2, T in 4.  
“GUSTS” is a valid word: G, U, S, T, S.  
It uses S, T, U and G.  
S is in position 2 (allowed), T in 4 (allowed), U in 3 (allowed).  
All letters are from the allowed set.

Thus, “GUSTS” is a strong next guess.

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the pattern. The feedback shows S is in position 5, T in 4, U in 2. So the word is: ? U ? T S

Looking at valid English words ending in ""UTS"", but with U in position 2, T in 4, S in 5.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words matching the pattern _ U _ T S:

- BUSTS – but B is allowed, U in 2, S in 5, T in 4. This fits all constraints.
- CUSTS – but C is allowed, same positions.
- DUSTS – D is allowed.
- FUSTS – F is allowed.
- HUSTS – H is allowed.
- JUSTS – J is allowed.
- PUSTS – P is allowed.
- VUSTS – V is allowed.
- WUSTS – W is allowed.
- XUSTS – X is allowed.
- ZUSTS – Z is allowed.

All of these are valid, but ""BUSTS"" is the most common word. Let me check if any of these have eliminated letters:

- BUSTS: B, U, S, T, S – all letters are allowed (B is allowed, U is allowed, S is allowed, T is allowed).
- CUSTS: C, U, S, T, S – C is allowed.
- DUSTS: D is allowed.
- etc.

All fit. The most common and likely is ""BUSTS"".Based on the feedback, we now know:
- U is in position 2
- T is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, N, K, G

The word must be _ U _ T S. The most common valid word fitting this pattern is:
