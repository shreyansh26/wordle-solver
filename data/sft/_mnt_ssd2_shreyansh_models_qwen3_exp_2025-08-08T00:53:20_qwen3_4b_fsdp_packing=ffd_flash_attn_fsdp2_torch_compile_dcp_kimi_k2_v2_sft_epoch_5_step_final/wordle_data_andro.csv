### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E)
- All letters are among the most common in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word
- It doesn't repeat any letters, giving us maximum feedback per letter

From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 1.
   - R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. ACORN → A(✓) C(x) O(-) R(✓) N(-)
   - A is still correct in position 1.
   - R is now correct in position 4.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are in the word but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ _ R _
- Letters in the word: A, R, O, C, N (but C is not in position 2 and N is not in position 5).
- Letters not in the word: S, E.

We need to place O, C, and N into positions 2, 3, and 5, ensuring:
- O is not in position 3.
- C is not in position 2.
- N is not in position 5.

Possible permutations for positions 2, 3, 5 using O, C, N:
- Position 2: cannot be C or N (since C is not allowed in 2 and N is not allowed in 5, but this doesn't restrict N in 2 directly)
- Position 3: cannot be O
- Position 5: cannot be N

Looking at valid arrangements:
- If O is in position 2: Then C and N must be in 3 and 5. But N cannot be in 5, so N must be in 3 and C in 5. This gives: A O N R C
- If O is in position 5: Then C and N must be in 2 and 3. C cannot be in 2, so C must be in 3 and N in 2. This gives: A N C R O

Checking these:
1. ANO RC: ""ANOCR"" - not a valid word
2. A N C R O: ""ANCRO"" - not a valid word
3. A C N R O: ""ACNRO"" - invalid
4. A O N R C: ""AONRC"" - invalid

Hmm, none of these permutations form valid English words. Maybe we need to include another letter. Since we have used A, R, O, C, N, and the word must be 5 letters, we might need to consider that we might have missed other letters. However, from the feedback, we know the word must contain A, R, O, C, N. 

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
- Guess 2: ACORN → A(✓) C(x) O(-) R(✓) N(-)
  - This means C is NOT in the word (x), so our previous assumption was wrong. The letters in the word are A, R, O, N (from the positions marked with - and ✓). The C is just not in the word.

So the letters in the word are: A, R, O, N (and R is fixed in position 4).

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, with R in position 4, containing O and N, and avoiding S, E, C.

Possible pattern: A _ _ R _
Letters to place: O, N in positions 2, 3, 5 (but O cannot be in 3, N cannot be in 5).

Possible permutations:
- Position 2: O or N
- Position 3: O or N (but not same as position 2)
- Position 5: N (but N cannot be in 5) - so N must be in 2 or 3, and O in the remaining of 2/3, and position 5 must be filled by another letter. But we have only A, R, O, N so far.

Wait, we have 5 positions and the word must contain A, R, O, N, and one more letter. From the feedback, we have not yet tested other letters. The letters not in the word are S, E, C.

Looking for a word that starts with A, has R in position 4, contains O and N, and one more letter (not S, E, C). The most common remaining letters are D, L, M, P, T, etc.

Possible words:
- A D O R N
- A M O R N
- A L O R N
- A P O R N

""ADORN"" is a valid English word:
- A(✓) D _ O(-) R(✓) N(-)
- This would fit: A D O R N
- Check constraints:
  - Starts with A
  - R in position 4
  - Contains O and N
  - Doesn't use S, E, C
  - O is in position 3 (allowed since O can't be in 3 from earlier? Wait no: from AROSE, O was in position 3 with (-), meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So O cannot be in 3. Thus ADORN is invalid because O would be in 3.

- Check positions:
  - A(✓) P _ R(✓) O(-) N(-)
  - R is in position 3, but we know R must be in position 4. So this is invalid.

Wait, let's re-express the pattern:
- A _ _ R _
- Must contain O and N in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5), with:
  - O not in 3
  - N not in 5

Possible placements:
- O in 2: Then N must be in 3 or 5. But 5 can't be N, so N in 3: A O N R _
  - Then position 5 must be filled by a new letter (not S, E, C). Common letters: D, L, M, T.
  - ""AONRD"" - invalid
  - ""AONRL"" - invalid
  - ""AONRM"" - invalid
  - ""AONRT"" - invalid

- O in 5: Then N must be in 2 or 3. C can't be in 2 (but C isn't in word anyway). 
  - N in 2: A N _ R O
    - Position 3 must be filled by a new letter (not S, E, C). Common: D, L, M, T.
    - ""ANDRO"" - valid word!
    - Check: A N D R O
      - A(✓) N _ D _ R(✓) O(-)
      - R is in position 4 (correct)

Wait, let's re-express the pattern:
- A _ _ R _
- Must contain O and N in the remaining positions (2, 3, 5), with:
  - O not in 3
  - N not in 5

Possible placements:
- O in 2: Then N must be in 3 or 5. But 5 can't be N, so N in 3: A O N R _
  - Then position 5 must be filled by a new letter (not S, E, C). Common letters: D, L, M, T.
  - ""AONRD"" - invalid
  - ""AONRL"" - invalid
  - ""AONRM"" - invalid
  - ""AONRT"" - invalid

- O in 5: Then N must be in 2 or 3. C can't be in 2 (but C isn't in word anyway). 
  - N in 2: A N _ R O
    - Position 3 must be filled by a new letter (not S, E, C). Common: D, L, M, T.
    - ""ANDRO"" - valid word!
    - Check: A N D R O
      - A(✓) N _ D _ R(✓) O(-)
      - R is in position 4 (correct)
      - O is in position 5 (allowed, since O was not in 5 before)
      - N is in position 2 (allowed, since N was not in 2 before)
      - Doesn't use S, E, C
      - Valid English word ""ANDRO""

This seems to fit all constraints.Based on the feedback, the word must:
- Start with A
- Have R in position 4
- Contain O and N
- Avoid S, E, C

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ANDRO"".",Guess 3: ANDRO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) R(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
