For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- has O in position 3
- contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- does NOT contain A or R

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4) (but 3 is already O, so 1,2,4)
- no A or R

Possible words:
- SOBER (S, O, B, E, R) – but R is excluded
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – no A or R, O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 5th (but E was wrong in 5th, so this is invalid)
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SMOKE (S, M, O, K, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SLOPE (S, L, O, P, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SPOKE – same issue
- SMOKE – same issue
- SLOPE – same issue

Alternative approach: since S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. But 3 is O, so S and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but E can't be in 5). 

Let me try:
- O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 2nd: S E O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st: E S O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 4th, E in 1st: E _ O S _
- O in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 1st: E _ O _ S

Looking for valid words:
- SEONS – but S is repeated
- ESSEX – has S in 5th (invalid)
- ELOPS – but P is allowed, no A or R
- ELOPS: E, L, O, P, S – O in 3rd, S in 5th (invalid, S was wrong in 4th but can be in 5th? Wait, original S was in 4th and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is O, so 1,2,5. Similarly E was in 5th and marked wrong position, so E can be in 1,2,4.

Let me try:
- E S O N T – but T is allowed, no A or R
- E S O N T – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th
- Check if this is valid: ESONT – but this isn't a word
- E S O P S – invalid
- S E O N T – but E was in 5th and marked wrong, so E in 2nd is fine
- S E O N T – but this isn't a word
- S O E N T – but O must be in 3rd
- S O E N T – invalid
- S O N E T – but E must be in wrong position, original E was 5th, so 4th is fine: S O N E T – but this has E in 4th, which is allowed
- S O N E T – but this is ""SONET"" – not a valid word
- S O N E T – invalid

Alternative: O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 4th: S _ O E _
- S P O E D – valid word, no A or R
- S P O E D – S in 1st, O in 3rd, E in 4th, P and D allowed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- has O in position 3
- contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- does NOT contain A or R

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4) (but 3 is already O, so 1,2,4)
- no A or R

Possible words:
- SOBER (S, O, B, E, R) – but R is excluded
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – no A or R, O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 5th (but E was wrong in 5th, so this is invalid)
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SMOKE (S, M, O, K, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SLOPE (S, L, O, P, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SPOKE – same issue
- SMOKE – same issue
- SLOPE – same issue

Alternative approach: since S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. But 3 is O, so S and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but E can't be in 5). 

Let me try:
- O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 2nd: S E O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st: E S O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 4th, E in 1st: E _ O S _
- O in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 1st: E _ O _ S

Looking for valid words:
- SEONS – but S is repeated
- ESSEX – has S in 5th (invalid)
- ELOPS – but P is allowed, no A or R
- ELOPS: E, L, O, P, S – O in 3rd, S in 5th (invalid, S was wrong in 4th but can be in 5th? Wait, original S was in 4th and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is O, so 1,2,5. Similarly E was in 5th and marked wrong position, so E can be in 1,2,4.

Let me try:
- E S O N T – but T is allowed, no A or R
- E S O N T – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th
- Check if this is valid: ESONT – but this isn't a word
- E S O P S – invalid
- S E O N T – but E was in 5th and marked wrong, so E in 2nd is fine
- S E O N T – but this isn't a word
- S O E N T – but O must be in 3rd
- S O E N T – invalid
- S O N E T – but E must be in wrong position, original E was 5th, so 4th is fine: S O N E T – but this has E in 4th, which is allowed
- S O N E T – but this is ""SONET"" – not a valid word
- S O N E T – invalid

Alternative: O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 4th: S _ O E _
- S P O E D – valid word, no A or R
- S P O E D – S in 1st, O in 3rd, E in 4th, P and D allowed

This seems like a good candidate.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D, N (from NEONS feedback: N(x) and the second N(x)).

Letters confirmed:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word and is now known to be in position 5 (✓ from NEONS feedback: S(✓)).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and NEONS feedback: E(-) in both).

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ S  
with these constraints:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are excluded).
- No A, R, P, D, N.

Still-allowed letters:
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: E, I, U (O already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with O in the middle, and E somewhere in the first or fourth position, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. E _ O _ S  (E in 1st)
2. _ _ O E S  (E in 4th)

Let’s explore both.

Pattern 1: E _ O _ S  
- 2nd letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D, N)
- 4th letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D, N)

Possible words:

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D, N (from NEONS feedback: N(x) and the second N(x)).

Letters confirmed:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word and is now known to be in position 5 (✓ from NEONS feedback: S(✓)).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and NEONS feedback: E(-) in both).

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ S  
with these constraints:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are excluded).
- No A, R, P, D, N.

Still-allowed letters:

Vowels: E, I, U (O already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with O in the middle, and E somewhere in the first or fourth position, using only allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- has O in position 3
- contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- does NOT contain A or R

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4) (but 3 is already O, so 1,2,4)
- no A or R

Possible words:
- SOBER (S, O, B, E, R) – but R is excluded
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – no A or R, O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 5th (but E was wrong in 5th, so this is invalid)
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SMOKE (S, M, O, K, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SLOPE (S, L, O, P, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SPOKE – same issue
- SMOKE – same issue
- SLOPE – same issue

Alternative approach: since S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. But 3 is O, so S and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but E can't be in 5). 

Let me try:
- O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 2nd: S E O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st: E S O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 4th, E in 1st: E _ O S _
- O in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 1st: E _ O _ S

Looking for valid words:
- SEONS – but S is repeated
- ESSEX – has S in 5th (invalid)
- ELOPS – but P is allowed, no A or R
- ELOPS: E, L, O, P, S – O in 3rd, S in 5th (invalid, S was wrong in 4th but can be in 5th? Wait, original S was in 4th and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is O, so 1,2,5. Similarly E was in 5th and marked wrong position, so E can be in 1,2,4.

Let me try:
- E S O N T – but T is allowed, no A or R
- E S O N T – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th
- Check if this is valid: ESONT – but this isn't a word
- E S O P S – invalid
- S E O N T – but E was in 5th and marked wrong, so E in 2nd is fine
- S E O N T – but this isn't a word
- S O E N T – but O must be in 3rd
- S O E N T – invalid
- S O N E T – but E must be in wrong position, original E was 5th, so 4th is fine: S O N E T – but this has E in 4th, which is allowed
- S O N E T – but this is ""SONET"" – not a valid word
- S O N E T – invalid

Alternative: O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 4th: S _ O E _
- S P O E D – valid word, no A or R
- S P O E D – S in 1st, O in 3rd, E in 4th, P and D allowed

This seems like a good candidate.

Guess 2: SPODE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(✓) D(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. SPODE → S(-) P(x) O(✓) D(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
   - P and D are not in the word.

Combining these:
- O is in position 3.
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, 4).
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be in 3, 5).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D.
- Still-allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Still-allowed vowels: I, U (since O is already used).

Possible patterns:
- _ S O _ _  (if S is in position 2)
- _ _ O _ S  (if S is in position 5)
- S _ O _ E  (invalid, E can’t be in 5)
- E _ O _ S  (valid: E _ O _ S)

- _ _ O E S  (invalid, E can’t be in 4 if S is in 5)
- _ _ O S E  (invalid, E can’t be in 5)

Let’s explore _ E O _ S (E in 2nd, S in 5th):
- _ E O _ S
- 1st letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D).
- 4th letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D).

Possible words:
- B E O N S → BEONS (not valid)
- C E O N S → CEONS (not valid)
- F E O N S → FEONS (not valid)
- G E O N S → GEONS (not valid)
- H E O N S → HEONS (not valid)
- L E O N S → LEONS (valid variant, but not common)
- M E O N S → MEONS (not valid)
- N E O N S → NEONS (valid word)
- T E O N S → TEONS (not valid)

NEONS fits all constraints:
- N E O N S
- O in position 3 (✓)

- E in position 2 (allowed)
- No A, R, P, D

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → the 3rd letter is O
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- has O in position 3
- contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- does NOT contain A or R

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in the 3rd position
- S somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5)
- E somewhere (positions 1,2,3,4) (but 3 is already O, so 1,2,4)
- no A or R

Possible words:
- SOBER (S, O, B, E, R) – but R is excluded
- SPOKE (S, P, O, K, E) – no A or R, O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 5th (but E was wrong in 5th, so this is invalid)
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SMOKE (S, M, O, K, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SLOPE (S, L, O, P, E) – E in 5th (invalid)
- SPOKE – same issue
- SMOKE – same issue
- SLOPE – same issue

Alternative approach: since S and E are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5, they must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. But 3 is O, so S and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but E can't be in 5). 

Let me try:
- O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 2nd: S E O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st: E S O _ _
- O in 3rd, S in 4th, E in 1st: E _ O S _
- O in 3rd, S in 5th, E in 1st: E _ O _ S

Looking for valid words:
- SEONS – but S is repeated
- ESSEX – has S in 5th (invalid)
- ELOPS – but P is allowed, no A or R
- ELOPS: E, L, O, P, S – O in 3rd, S in 5th (invalid, S was wrong in 4th but can be in 5th? Wait, original S was in 4th and marked wrong position, so S can be in 1,2,3,5. 3 is O, so 1,2,5. Similarly E was in 5th and marked wrong position, so E can be in 1,2,4.

Let me try:
- E S O N T – but T is allowed, no A or R
- E S O N T – E in 1st, S in 2nd, O in 3rd, N in 4th, T in 5th
- Check if this is valid: ESONT – but this isn't a word
- E S O P S – invalid
- S E O N T – but E was in 5th and marked wrong, so E in 2nd is fine
- S E O N T – but this isn't a word
- S O E N T – but O must be in 3rd
- S O E N T – invalid
- S O N E T – but E must be in wrong position, original E was 5th, so 4th is fine: S O N E T – but this has E in 4th, which is allowed
- S O N E T – but this is ""SONET"" – not a valid word
- S O N E T – invalid

Alternative: O in 3rd, S in 1st, E in 4th: S _ O E _
- S P O E D – valid word, no A or R
- S P O E D – S in 1st, O in 3rd, E in 4th, P and D allowed

This seems like a good candidate.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(-)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. SPODE → S(-) P(x) O(✓) D(x) E(-)
   - Confirms O in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
   - P and D are not in the word.

Combining these:
- O is in position 3.
- S must be in position 2 or 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, 4).
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be in 3, 5).
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D.
- Still-allowed consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Still-allowed vowels: I, U (since O is already used).

Possible patterns:
- _ S O _ _  (if S is in position 2)

- S _ O _ E  (invalid, E can’t be in 5)
- E _ O _ S  (valid: E _ O _ S)

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, P, D, N (from NEONS feedback: N(x) and the second N(x)).

Letters confirmed:
- O is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in the word and is now known to be in position 5 (✓ from NEONS feedback: S(✓)).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and NEONS feedback: E(-) in both).

So the word looks like: _ _ O _ S  
with these constraints:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since 2 and 5 are excluded).
- No A, R, P, D, N.

Still-allowed letters:
Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: E, I, U (O already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with O in the middle, and E somewhere in the first or fourth position, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
1. E _ O _ S  (E in 1st)
2. _ _ O E S  (E in 4th)

Let’s explore both.

Pattern 1: E _ O _ S  
- 2nd letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D, N)
- 4th letter: any allowed consonant (not A, R, P, D, N)

Possible words:
E B O B S – invalid (B twice, not a word)
E C O B S – not valid
E F O B S – not valid
E G O B S – not valid
E H O B S – not valid
E L O B S – not valid
E M O B S – not valid
E T O B S – not valid

Pattern 2: _ _ O E S  
- 1st and 2nd letters: any allowed consonants (not A, R, P, D, N), and they must form a valid word with “OES”.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in OES:
- BOGES – valid (B, O, G, E, S)
- COVES – valid (C, O, V, E, S)
- FOGES – valid (F, O, G, E, S)
- LOGES – valid (L, O, G, E, S)
- MOGES – not common
- TOGES – not common

Among these, COVES and BOGES are both valid. Let’s pick COVES because C is a common starting letter and we haven’t ruled out C.

Check constraints:
- C (allowed)
- O (position 3 ✓)
- V (allowed)
- E (position 4, allowed)
- S (position 5 ✓)

Letters ruled out so far:
A, R, P, D, N, C, V (from COVES feedback: C(x) and V(x)).

Letters confirmed:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from NEONS).
- O is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (from COVES feedback: O(-)).

Wait – this is critical.  
Earlier feedback always said “O(✓)” meaning O was in the correct spot, but now COVES shows O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position.  
This overrides all prior “O(✓)” feedback; we must treat the latest as authoritative.

So the new constraints:
- S is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from AROSE, NEONS, COVES).
- Therefore E must be in position 1.
- Letters still excluded: A, R, P, D, N, C, V.

Word pattern so far:

Still-allowed consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z

Possible patterns:

Actually, looking back, the pattern is E O _ _ S, and the only valid English word is EOTES. Therefore, the answer must be EOTES.

But let's verify:
