For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these to help narrow down possibilities. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and has good letter distribution.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S and L, and does not contain A, T, or E.  
The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common include R, I, N, O, U, D, etc.  
Since S and L must appear somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are ruled out for them, I’ll try placing S and L in different spots and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

A good next guess might be “FLINS”:
- F and I are new common consonants and vowels.
- N is also common and untested.
- L and S are included and now in new positions (3 and 4 instead of 2 and 1).

   - R, O are not in the word.
   - L is not in position 1.
   - I is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ I _ _ S
- Must contain L (not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5) → L must be in position 4.
- Letters ruled out: A, T, E, F, N, R, O.

So the word must be: _ I _ L S

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- C I D L S → ""CIDLS"" (not a valid English word)
- C I M L S → ""CIMLS"" (invalid)

- D I C L S → ""DICLS"" (invalid)
- H I D L S → ""HIDLS"" (invalid)
- M I D L S → ""MIDLS"" (invalid)
- C I U L S → ""CIULS"" (invalid)

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ I _ L S. The only common 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. ""WILDS"" - W is untested, but D is untested. Let me check:

""W I L D S"" - but D is in position 4, which would require L in position 3 (but L must be in 4). This doesn't fit.

Actually, the correct pattern is _ I _ L S with L in position 4. The only valid word seems to be ""WILDS"" but that has L in position 3. This suggests I made an error.

Re-evaluating: L must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5). So the word is _ I _ L S. The only valid English word fitting this is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This implies no valid word, which can't be right.

I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the constraints:

From LIROS feedback:
- L is not in position 1 (✓)
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- R and O are not in the word (✓)

From SLATE:
- L is not in position 2 (✓)

From FLINS:
- L is not in position 3 (✓)

So L cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ I _ L S

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This suggests no valid word, which indicates an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me list possible letters for position 1 and 3:

Position 1: Cannot be L, S, I. Valid letters: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 3: Cannot be L, S, I. Valid letters: same as above.

Possible combinations:
- B I D L S → ""BIDLS"" (invalid)
- C I D L S → ""CIDLS"" (invalid)
- G I D L S → ""GIDLS"" (invalid)
- H I D L S → ""HIDLS"" (invalid)
- M I D L S → ""MIDLS"" (invalid)
- P I D L S → ""PIDLS"" (invalid)
- V I D L S → ""VIDLS"" (invalid)
- W I D L S → ""WIDLS"" (invalid)

This seems impossible. I must have missed a word. Let me think of other words ending in IS but that doesn't fit.

Actually, the word must be _ I _ L S. The only valid word I can think of is ""WILDS"" but that has L in position 3, which is not allowed. This suggests no valid word, which can't be right.

I realize now that the word must be ""WILDS"" but with L in position 4, which would require the word to be ""W I L D S"" but that has L in 3. This indicates I need to reconsider.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be ""WILDS"" despite the position of L, as the constraints might allow it. However, according to the feedback, L cannot be in position 3. This leaves me with no valid options.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully:

From all feedback:
- Word ends with S (position 5).
- I is in position 2.
- L is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be in position 4.
- Ruled out letters: A, T, E, F, N, R, O.

Thus the word must be: _ I _ L S

The only valid English word fitting this is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This suggests no valid word, which indicates an inconsistency.

Upon deeper thought, the word must be ""WILDS"" with L in position 3, but this contradicts the feedback that L is not in position 3. This implies no valid word exists under these constraints, which is impossible.

I realize now that the correct word must be ""WILDS"" despite the apparent contradiction, as the feedback might imply L is not in position 3 (from FLINS) but could still be in position 4. However, this would require the word to be ""W I _ L S"" with L in 4, which would be ""W I D L S"" but ""WIDLS"" is invalid.

This indicates I need to consider ""WILDS"" as the word, accepting that the constraints might allow L in position 3 despite the feedback, or there might be an inconsistency. Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""WILDS"".

After careful reconsideration, the word must be ""WILDS"" with L in position 3, as the feedback from FLINS indicates L is not in position 3, but from LIROS indicates L is not in position 1. This leaves L in position 3 as possible, contradicting SLATE feedback.

This suggests the only valid word is ""WILDS"", and the constraints might imply L is in position 3 despite the feedback, indicating possible misinterpretation. Given the constraints, the word must be ""WILDS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these to help narrow down possibilities. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and has good letter distribution.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S and L, and does not contain A, T, or E.  
The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common include R, I, N, O, U, D, etc.  
Since S and L must appear somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are ruled out for them, I’ll try placing S and L in different spots and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

A good next guess might be “FLINS”:
- F and I are new common consonants and vowels.
- N is also common and untested.
- L and S are included and now in new positions (3 and 4 instead of 2 and 1).

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. FLINS → F(x) L(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
   - F and N are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) and now we also know it’s not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S is in the word and is now confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- It contains L and I, but:
  – L cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
  – I cannot be in position 4.
- Letters ruled out: A, T, E, F, N.

Common remaining letters to test: R, O, U, D, C, G, H, M, Y, etc.

We have two letters to place (L and I) in positions 1-4, with constraints:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try a word that uses L in position 1 and I in position 2, filling the remaining slots with fresh common letters:

Possible word: L I _ _ S

Testing common consonants and vowels: R, O, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is “LIROS”:
- L in position 1 (allowed).
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- R, O are new common letters.
- Ends with S (confirmed).

Let me check: L I R O S – all letters are valid and fit constraints.

I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the constraints:

- R and O are not in the word (✓)

From SLATE:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and maximizes the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain several of these to help narrow down possibilities. 

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters and has good letter distribution.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains S and L, and does not contain A, T, or E.  
The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common include R, I, N, O, U, D, etc.  
Since S and L must appear somewhere, and positions 1 and 2 are ruled out for them, I’ll try placing S and L in different spots and fill the rest with fresh common letters.

A good next guess might be “FLINS”:
- F and I are new common consonants and vowels.
- N is also common and untested.
- L and S are included and now in new positions (3 and 4 instead of 2 and 1).

Guess 2: FLINS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. FLINS → F(x) L(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
   - F and N are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) and now we also know it’s not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - S is in the word and is now confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S (position 5).
- It contains L and I, but:
  – L cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
  – I cannot be in position 4.
- Letters ruled out: A, T, E, F, N.

Common remaining letters to test: R, O, U, D, C, G, H, M, Y, etc.

We have two letters to place (L and I) in positions 1-4, with constraints:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions: 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try a word that uses L in position 1 and I in position 2, filling the remaining slots with fresh common letters:

Possible word: L I _ _ S

Testing common consonants and vowels: R, O, U, D, etc.

A good candidate is “LIROS”:
- L in position 1 (allowed).
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- R, O are new common letters.
- Ends with S (confirmed).

Let me check: L I R O S – all letters are valid and fit constraints.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A, T, E are not in the word.

2. FLINS → F(x) L(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
   - F, N are not in the word.
   - L is not in position 3.
   - I is not in position 4.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

3. LIROS → L(-) I(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓)
   - R, O are not in the word.
   - L is not in position 1.
   - I is confirmed in position 2.
   - S is confirmed in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ I _ _ S
- Must contain L (not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5) → L must be in position 4.
- Letters ruled out: A, T, E, F, N, R, O.

So the word must be: _ I _ L S

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, G, H, M, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- C I D L S → ""CIDLS"" (not a valid English word)
- C I M L S → ""CIMLS"" (invalid)
- C I G L S → ""CIGLS"" (invalid)
- D I C L S → ""DICLS"" (invalid)
- H I D L S → ""HIDLS"" (invalid)
- M I D L S → ""MIDLS"" (invalid)
- C I U L S → ""CIULS"" (invalid)

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ I _ L S. The only common 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. ""WILDS"" - W is untested, but D is untested. Let me check:

""W I L D S"" - but D is in position 4, which would require L in position 3 (but L must be in 4). This doesn't fit.

Actually, the correct pattern is _ I _ L S with L in position 4. The only valid word seems to be ""WILDS"" but that has L in position 3. This suggests I made an error.

Re-evaluating: L must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5). So the word is _ I _ L S. The only valid English word fitting this is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This implies no valid word, which can't be right.

I must have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the constraints:

From LIROS feedback:
- L is not in position 1 (✓)
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- R and O are not in the word (✓)

From SLATE:
- L is not in position 2 (✓)

From FLINS:
- L is not in position 3 (✓)

So L cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ I _ L S

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This suggests no valid word, which indicates an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me list possible letters for position 1 and 3:

Position 1: Cannot be L, S, I. Valid letters: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Position 3: Cannot be L, S, I. Valid letters: same as above.

Possible combinations:
- B I D L S → ""BIDLS"" (invalid)
- C I D L S → ""CIDLS"" (invalid)
- G I D L S → ""GIDLS"" (invalid)
- H I D L S → ""HIDLS"" (invalid)
- M I D L S → ""MIDLS"" (invalid)
- P I D L S → ""PIDLS"" (invalid)
- V I D L S → ""VIDLS"" (invalid)
- W I D L S → ""WIDLS"" (invalid)

This seems impossible. I must have missed a word. Let me think of other words ending in IS but that doesn't fit.

Actually, the word must be _ I _ L S. The only valid word I can think of is ""WILDS"" but that has L in position 3, which is not allowed. This suggests no valid word, which can't be right.

I realize now that the word must be ""WILDS"" but with L in position 4, which would require the word to be ""W I L D S"" but that has L in 3. This indicates I need to reconsider.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be ""WILDS"" despite the position of L, as the constraints might allow it. However, according to the feedback, L cannot be in position 3. This leaves me with no valid options.

I must have made an error. Let me re-examine the constraints carefully:

From all feedback:
- Word ends with S (position 5).
- I is in position 2.
- L is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,5 → must be in position 4.
- Ruled out letters: A, T, E, F, N, R, O.

Thus the word must be: _ I _ L S

The only valid English word fitting this is ""DILTS"" but T is ruled out. This suggests no valid word, which indicates an inconsistency.

Upon deeper thought, the word must be ""WILDS"" with L in position 3, but this contradicts the feedback that L is not in position 3. This implies no valid word exists under these constraints, which is impossible.

I realize now that the correct word must be ""WILDS"" despite the apparent contradiction, as the feedback might imply L is not in position 3 (from FLINS) but could still be in position 4. However, this would require the word to be ""W I _ L S"" with L in 4, which would be ""W I D L S"" but ""WIDLS"" is invalid.

This indicates I need to consider ""WILDS"" as the word, accepting that the constraints might allow L in position 3 despite the feedback, or there might be an inconsistency. Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""WILDS"".

After careful reconsideration, the word must be ""WILDS"" with L in position 3, as the feedback from FLINS indicates L is not in position 3, but from LIROS indicates L is not in position 1. This leaves L in position 3 as possible, contradicting SLATE feedback.

This suggests the only valid word is ""WILDS"", and the constraints might imply L is in position 3 despite the feedback, indicating possible misinterpretation. Given the constraints, the word must be ""WILDS"".

<guess>WILDS</guess>Based on the accumulated constraints, the word must be _ I _ L S with L in position 4, but no valid 5-letter English word fits this pattern. Re-evaluating the constraints more carefully, the only plausible word that satisfies all feedback is:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: FLINS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(-) N(x) S(✓)
Guess 3: LIROS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: WILDS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) L(✓) D(x) S(✓)

From Guess 4 (WILDS) we now know:
- W is not in the word.
- I is in position 2 (✓).
- L is in position 3 (✓).
- D is not in the word.
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the confirmed pattern is: _ I L _ S

Letters ruled out so far: A, T, E, F, N, R, O, D, W.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: ? I L ? S  
The first and fourth positions must be filled with letters not yet excluded.

Common unused letters: B, C, G, H, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- B I L ? S → BILIS (invalid)
- C I L ? S → CILIS (invalid)
- G I L ? S → GILIS (invalid)
- H I L ? S → HILIS (invalid)
- M I L ? S → MILIS (invalid)
- P I L ? S → PILIS (invalid)
- C I L C S → CILCS (invalid)
- G I L G S → GILGS (invalid)

Wait, let's think of valid English words ending in ""IL_S"":
The only common word is ""HILLS"" but that has L twice and we already know L is in position 3. ""BILLS"" same issue. ""FILLS"" but F is ruled out. ""MILLS"" but M is allowed and second L would be in position 4.

But we have no restriction against repeating letters unless feedback indicates otherwise. The pattern is _ I L _ S, and the only valid word is ""MILLS"".

Let me check:
- M I L L S
- M: untested, allowed
- I: position 2 ✓
- L: position 3 ✓
- L: position 4 (no restriction)
- S: position 5 ✓

This fits all constraints.

This implies no valid word exists under these constraints, which is impossible.\n\nI realize now that the correct word must be ""WILDS"" despite the apparent contradiction, as the feedback might imply L is not in position 3 (from FLINS) but could still be in position 4. However, this would require the word to be ""W I _ L S"" with L in 4, which would be ""W I D L S"" but ""WIDLS"" is invalid.\n\nThis indicates I need to consider ""WILDS"" as the word, accepting that the constraints might allow L in position 3 despite the feedback, or there might be an inconsistency.
