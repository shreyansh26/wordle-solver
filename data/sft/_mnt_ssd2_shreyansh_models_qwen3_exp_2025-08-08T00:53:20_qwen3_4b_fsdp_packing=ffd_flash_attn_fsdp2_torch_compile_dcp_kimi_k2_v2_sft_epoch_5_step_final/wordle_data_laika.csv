For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) : R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not as the first letter.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word like “TAINT”:
- T: common consonant
- A: in position 2 (allowed, since A can’t be first)
- I: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- T: repeats T, which is allowed and might help confirm T’s presence.

But “TAINT” uses T twice, which might not be optimal for information gain. Instead, let’s pick “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are all common consonants.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

However, “PLANT” has A in position 2, which is fine, but let’s see if we can do better with more varied letters. Another option is “CHAIR” but R is excluded. “MUSIC” has no A. 

A better choice might be “PAINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

This seems optimal for information gain.

From the two guesses we have:

   – A is **correctly placed** in position 2.  
   – I is **correctly placed** in position 3.  
   – P, N, T are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A I _ _  (positions 2 and 3 are locked)
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Allowed letters: A (already used), B C D F G H I J K L M Q U V W X Y Z

We need two more letters for positions 1, 4, 5.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowel: U (I is already used, A is fixed in pos 2, E is forbidden).

Let’s try to pick common letters that fit:  
- Position 1: common start letters like C, D, F, G, H, L, M  
- Position 4: could be any remaining letter  
- Position 5: could be any remaining letter

A word that uses common remaining letters and fits the pattern _ A I _ _ is “C A I R _”, but R is forbidden. “C A I D _” – “CAID_” isn’t a word. “C A I L _” – “CAIL_” isn’t a word. “C A I R _” again R is out.

Another approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit _ A I _ _.  
Some possibilities:  
- C A I R Y → “CAIRY” (variant spelling, but uncommon)  
- C A I R N → “CAIRN” (but N is forbidden)  
- M A I Z E → “MAIZE” (but E is forbidden)

- L A I F T → “LAIFT” (not a word)

- D A I L Y → “DAILY” – uses D, A, I, L, Y. All letters are allowed (D, L, Y not yet excluded). This seems valid.

Let’s check “DAILY”:
- D: not yet excluded  
- A: confirmed in position 2  
- I: confirmed in position 3  
- L: not yet excluded  
- Y: not yet excluded  

No forbidden letters are used, and it fits the pattern _ A I _ _. This seems like a good third guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
- All distinct letters to maximize information gain

However, “PLANT” has A in position 2, which is fine, but let’s see if we can do better with more varied letters. Another option is “CHAIR” but R is excluded. “MUSIC” has no A. 

A better choice might be “PAINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all common.
- A is in position 2.
- No R, O, S, E.

This seems optimal for information gain.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are **not** in the word at all.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)  
   – A is **correctly placed** in position 2.  
   – I is **correctly placed** in position 3.  
   – P, N, T are **not** in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A I _ _  (positions 2 and 3 are locked)
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Allowed letters: A (already used), B C D F G H I J K L M Q U V W X Y Z

We need two more letters for positions 1, 4, 5.  
Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowel: U (I is already used, A is fixed in pos 2, E is forbidden).

Let’s try to pick common letters that fit:  
- Position 1: common start letters like C, D, F, G, H, L, M  
- Position 4: could be any remaining letter  
- Position 5: could be any remaining letter

A word that uses common remaining letters and fits the pattern _ A I _ _ is “C A I R _”, but R is forbidden. “C A I D _” – “CAID_” isn’t a word. “C A I L _” – “CAIL_” isn’t a word. “C A I R _” again R is out.

Another approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit _ A I _ _.  
Some possibilities:  
- C A I R Y → “CAIRY” (variant spelling, but uncommon)  
- C A I R N → “CAIRN” (but N is forbidden)  
- M A I Z E → “MAIZE” (but E is forbidden)  
- H A I K U → “HAIKU” (but U is allowed, K is allowed)  
- L A I F T → “LAIFT” (not a word)  
- F A I R Y → “FAIRY” (but R is forbidden)  
- D A I L Y → “DAILY” (but L is allowed, Y is allowed)  
- D A I L Y → “DAILY” – uses D, A, I, L, Y. All letters are allowed (D, L, Y not yet excluded). This seems valid.

Let’s check “DAILY”:
- D: not yet excluded  
- A: confirmed in position 2  
- I: confirmed in position 3  
- L: not yet excluded  
- Y: not yet excluded  

No forbidden letters are used, and it fits the pattern _ A I _ _. This seems like a good third guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, not in position 1.  
   – R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)  
   – A is **correctly placed** in position 2.  
   – I is **correctly placed** in position 3.  
   – P, N, T are **not** in the word.

3. DAILY → D(x) A(✓) I(✓) L(-) Y(x)  
   – A and I still correct in positions 2-3.  
   – L is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
   – D, Y are **not** in the word.

So we know the pattern is:  
_ A I _ _  (positions 2 and 3 locked)  
Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, D, Y  
Allowed letters: A (already used), B, C, F, G, H, I (already used), J, K, L (must be in pos 1 or 5), M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

We need two more letters for positions 1, 4, 5, with L appearing **once** and **not** in position 4.

Possible placements for L:  
- Position 1: L A I _ _  
- Position 5: _ A I _ L  

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit _ A I _ _ or _ _ A I _ with L in 1 or 5.

- L A I R _ → “LAIR_” (but R is forbidden)  
- L A I F T → “LAIFT” (not a word)  
- C A I R _ → R forbidden  
- M A I Z E → E forbidden  
- H A I K U → fits _ A I _ _, no forbidden letters, but we haven’t used H, K, U yet.  
- F A I R Y → R forbidden  
- B A I L _ → “BAIL_” (but L would be in position 4, which is disallowed)  
- L A I B _ → “LAIB_” (not a word)  
- L A I K _ → “LAIK_” (not a word)  
- L A I K O → “LAIKO” (not a word)  

Actually, the pattern is _ A I _ _, so let’s focus on that.  
We need:  
- Position 1: any allowed letter (B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)  
- Position 4: any allowed letter except L (since L must be in 1 or 5)  
- Position 5: L (since L cannot be in 4)  

So the word must be:  
[Allowed letter] A I [Allowed letter] L  

Looking at allowed letters, common ones are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W.  
Possible words:  
- B A I K L → “BAIKL” (not a word)  
- C A I R L → R forbidden  
- C A I K L → “CAIKL” (not a word)  
- H A I K L → “HAIKL” (not a word)  
- F A I R L → R forbidden  
- G A I L L → “GAILL” (not a word)  
- M A I K L → “MAIKL” (not a word)  
- C A I L L → “CAILL” (not a word)  

Wait, let’s list actual English words that fit _ A I _ L:  
- C A I R L → R forbidden  
- H A I K L → no  
- B A I L K → “BAILK” (no)  
- C A I R L → R forbidden  

Actually, “CAIRL” isn’t a word, but “CAIRN” is, but N is forbidden.  

Another approach: L in position 1.  
L A I _ _ with positions 4-5 filled from remaining allowed letters.  
Allowed letters for 4-5: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

Possible words:  
- L A I K O → O forbidden  
- L A I K U → “LAIKU” (not a word)  
- L A I K Y → Y forbidden  
- L A I K E → E forbidden  
- L A I K A → “LAIKA” (a word, the dog in *Soylent Green*)  

“LAIKA” uses:  
L (allowed, in position 1)  
A (position 2, correct)  
I (position 3, correct)  
K (allowed)  
A (allowed, but A is already in position 2)  

However, double A is possible. Let’s check:  
- L, A, I, K, A – all letters are allowed (L, K not forbidden) and positions fit.  

Another candidate: “LAIBO” – but O is forbidden.  

“LAIKA” seems to be the only plausible word fitting _ A I _ L with allowed letters.  

But let’s verify:  
- L A I K A:  
  – L in position 1 (allowed)  
  – A in 2 (correct)  
  – I in 3 (correct)  
  – K in 4 (allowed)  
  – A in 5 (allowed)  

No forbidden letters used.  

Therefore, “LAIKA” is a valid next guess.
