For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly preferred as it covers more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out, and O is already in).

Let’s try a word that uses O plus other remaining common letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Contains O (in position 2, which is allowed since position 3 is the only restriction so far).
- Uses P, I, N, T which are all still possible letters.

Another check: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these letters (except O) were ruled out, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""POINT"" seems like a solid second guess.

3. I(x) – I is not in the word.
4. N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, T
- Other letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T somewhere (since both are marked “in word, wrong position”)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I

Let’s list some 5-letter words with O in position 2 that contain both N and T:

- TON** – but we need 5 letters, and TON** would be too short.
- **TON** – same issue.
- We need a word like _ O _ _ _ that includes N and T in positions 1,3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- TON** – no, as above.
- **O**N T – no.
- Let’s think of words like “CONTO” – but C is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, N and T need to fit.

Actually, we need to ensure both N and T appear somewhere in the word, and O is fixed in position 2.

One approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2, then filter those that contain both N and T, and exclude any containing A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s try:
- “BOUND” – but U is allowed, B is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, U is allowed, N and T are present. However, this word has O in position 2, but we need to check if it fits all constraints:
  - B (allowed), O (position 2, correct), U (allowed), N (must be present), D (allowed). But does it have T? No, it has D. So “BOUND” is out.

- “CLOUD” – same issue, no T.

- “FOUNT” – F (allowed), O (position 2), U (allowed), N (must be present), T (must be present). This word has both N and T, and O in position 2, and none of the forbidden letters (A,R,S,E,P,I). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- F – not ruled out.
- O – correct position 2.
- U – not ruled out.
- N – must be present (and it is).
- T – must be present (and it is).

And “FOUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, my next guess is “FOUNT”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly preferred as it covers more unique vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

1. P(x) – P is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. I(x) – I is not in the word.
4. N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, T
- Other letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T somewhere (since both are marked “in word, wrong position”)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I

Let’s list some 5-letter words with O in position 2 that contain both N and T:

- TON** – but we need 5 letters, and TON** would be too short.
- **TON** – same issue.
- We need a word like _ O _ _ _ that includes N and T in positions 1,3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- TON** – no, as above.
- **O**N T – no.
- Let’s think of words like “CONTO” – but C is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, N and T need to fit.

Actually, we need to ensure both N and T appear somewhere in the word, and O is fixed in position 2.

One approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2, then filter those that contain both N and T, and exclude any containing A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s try:
- “BOUND” – but U is allowed, B is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, U is allowed, N and T are present. However, this word has O in position 2, but we need to check if it fits all constraints:
  - B (allowed), O (position 2, correct), U (allowed), N (must be present), D (allowed). But does it have T? No, it has D. So “BOUND” is out.

- “CLOUD” – same issue, no T.

- “FOUNT” – F (allowed), O (position 2), U (allowed), N (must be present), T (must be present). This word has both N and T, and O in position 2, and none of the forbidden letters (A,R,S,E,P,I). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- F – not ruled out.
- O – correct position 2.
- U – not ruled out.
- N – must be present (and it is).
- T – must be present (and it is).

And “FOUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, my next guess is “FOUNT”.

The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n\nOne of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.\n\nAnother strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels).

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)  
Guess 3: FOUNT → F(x) O(✓) U(-) N(-) T(-)

1. O is fixed in position 2: _ O _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, T, U  
   - From FOUNT: U is in the word but not in position 3 (because it got “-”).  
   - From POINT: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - From FOUNT: N is also not in position 3 (same “-”).  
   - From POINT: T is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - From FOUNT: T is also not in position 5 (same “-”).  

So:
- Positions 1,3,4,5 are still open for N, T, U.  
- The word must contain N, T, U plus one more letter (since O is already placed).  
- The remaining letter must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A,R,S,E,P,I,F).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ _ that contains N, T, U and one more consonant, with no repeats of any ruled-out letters.

Let’s list possible placements of N, T, U across positions 1,3,4,5, ensuring they don’t go where they’ve been ruled out:

- N cannot be in 3 or 4 (from FOUNT and POINT). So N can only be in 1 or 5.  
- T cannot be in 5. So T can be in 1,3,4.  
- U cannot be in 3 (from FOUNT). So U can be in 1,4,5.

Let’s try to form a valid word:

Option 1: N in 1, T in 3, U in 4  
   Pattern: N O T U _  
   Need a 5th letter in position 5 that’s allowed and hasn’t been used.

   Pattern: N O _ T U  
   Need a letter in position 3.  
   Allowed consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

     Jotun is a valid 5-letter word (a Norse giant).

Let’s verify “JOTUN”:
- J – allowed (not ruled out).  
- O – correct in position 2.  
- T – must be present, in position 3 here.  
- U – must be present, in position 4 here.  
- N – must be present, in position 5 here.  

No letters from the forbidden list (A,R,S,E,P,I,F) are used. It fits all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is “JOTUN”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly preferred as it covers more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out, and O is already in).

Let’s try a word that uses O plus other remaining common letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Contains O (in position 2, which is allowed since position 3 is the only restriction so far).
- Uses P, I, N, T which are all still possible letters.

Another check: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these letters (except O) were ruled out, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""POINT"" seems like a solid second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

1. P(x) – P is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. I(x) – I is not in the word.
4. N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, T
- Other letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T somewhere (since both are marked “in word, wrong position”)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I

Let’s list some 5-letter words with O in position 2 that contain both N and T:

- TON** – but we need 5 letters, and TON** would be too short.
- **TON** – same issue.
- We need a word like _ O _ _ _ that includes N and T in positions 1,3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- TON** – no, as above.
- **O**N T – no.
- Let’s think of words like “CONTO” – but C is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, N and T need to fit.

Actually, we need to ensure both N and T appear somewhere in the word, and O is fixed in position 2.

One approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2, then filter those that contain both N and T, and exclude any containing A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s try:
- “BOUND” – but U is allowed, B is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, U is allowed, N and T are present. However, this word has O in position 2, but we need to check if it fits all constraints:
  - B (allowed), O (position 2, correct), U (allowed), N (must be present), D (allowed). But does it have T? No, it has D. So “BOUND” is out.

- “CLOUD” – same issue, no T.

- “FOUNT” – F (allowed), O (position 2), U (allowed), N (must be present), T (must be present). This word has both N and T, and O in position 2, and none of the forbidden letters (A,R,S,E,P,I). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- F – not ruled out.
- O – correct position 2.
- U – not ruled out.
- N – must be present (and it is).
- T – must be present (and it is).

And “FOUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, my next guess is “FOUNT”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
Guess 3: FOUNT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) U(-) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)  
Guess 3: FOUNT → F(x) O(✓) U(-) N(-) T(-)

1. O is fixed in position 2: _ O _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, T, U  
   - From FOUNT: U is in the word but not in position 3 (because it got “-”).  
   - From POINT: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - From FOUNT: N is also not in position 3 (same “-”).  
   - From POINT: T is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - From FOUNT: T is also not in position 5 (same “-”).  

So:
- Positions 1,3,4,5 are still open for N, T, U.  
- The word must contain N, T, U plus one more letter (since O is already placed).  
- The remaining letter must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A,R,S,E,P,I,F).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ _ that contains N, T, U and one more consonant, with no repeats of any ruled-out letters.

Let’s list possible placements of N, T, U across positions 1,3,4,5, ensuring they don’t go where they’ve been ruled out:

- N cannot be in 3 or 4 (from FOUNT and POINT). So N can only be in 1 or 5.  
- T cannot be in 5. So T can be in 1,3,4.  
- U cannot be in 3 (from FOUNT). So U can be in 1,4,5.

Let’s try to form a valid word:

Option 1: N in 1, T in 3, U in 4  
   Pattern: N O T U _  
   Need a 5th letter in position 5 that’s allowed and hasn’t been used.  
   Possible: N O T U B → “NOTUB” – not a valid word.  
   N O T U L → “NOTUL” – invalid.

   None of these are valid English words.

Option 2: N in 1, T in 4, U in 5  
   Pattern: N O _ T U  
   Need a letter in position 3.  
   Allowed consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   N O U T W → “NOUTW” – invalid.  
   N O U T Y → “NOUTY” – invalid.  
   N O U T Z → “NOUTZ” – invalid.  
   None of these are valid.

Option 4: N in 5, T in 1, U in 3 or 4  
   Pattern: T O U _ N  
   Need a letter in position 4.  
   T O U B N → “TOUBN” – invalid.

   T O U M N → “TOUMN” – invalid.  
   T O U V N → “TOUVN” – invalid.  
   T O U W N → “TOWN” – invalid (only 4 letters).  
   T O U Y N → “TOYN” – invalid.  
   T O U Z N → “TOZN” – invalid.  
   None of these are valid.

Option 5: N in 5, T in 3, U in 1 or 4  
   Pattern: _ O T _ N  
   U must fit in 1 or 4.  
   - U in 1: U O T _ N  
     Need a letter in position 4.  
     U O T B N → “UOTBN” – invalid.  
     U O T C N → “UOTCN” – invalid.  
     U O T D N → “UOTDN” – invalid.  
     U O T G N → “UOTGN” – invalid.  
     U O T H N → “UOTHN” – invalid.

     U O T L N → “UOTLN” – invalid.  
     U O T M N → “UOTMN” – invalid.  
     U O T V N → “UOTVN” – invalid.  
     U O T W N → “UOTWN” – invalid.  
     U O T Y N → “UOTYN” – invalid.

     Need a letter in position 1.  
     B O T U N → “BOTUN” – invalid.  
     C O T U N → “COTUN” – invalid.  
     D O T U N → “DOTUN” – invalid.  
     G O T U N → “GOTUN” – invalid.  
     H O T U N → “HOTUN” – invalid.  
     J O T U N → “JOTUN” – valid!  
     Jotun is a valid 5-letter word (a Norse giant).

Let’s verify “JOTUN”:
- J – allowed (not ruled out).  
- O – correct in position 2.  
- T – must be present, in position 3 here.  
- U – must be present, in position 4 here.  
- N – must be present, in position 5 here.  

No letters from the forbidden list (A,R,S,E,P,I,F) are used. It fits all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is “JOTUN”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly preferred as it covers more unique vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but not in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains O (but not in position 3).
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out, and O is already in).

Let’s try a word that uses O plus other remaining common letters. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- Contains O (in position 2, which is allowed since position 3 is the only restriction so far).
- Uses P, I, N, T which are all still possible letters.

Another check: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T. None of these letters (except O) were ruled out, and O is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""POINT"" seems like a solid second guess.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

1. P(x) – P is not in the word.
2. O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
3. I(x) – I is not in the word.
4. N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
5. T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: N, T
- Other letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains both N and T somewhere (since both are marked “in word, wrong position”)
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I

Let’s list some 5-letter words with O in position 2 that contain both N and T:

- TON** – but we need 5 letters, and TON** would be too short.
- **TON** – same issue.
- We need a word like _ O _ _ _ that includes N and T in positions 1,3,4,5.

Possible candidates:
- TON** – no, as above.
- **O**N T – no.
- Let’s think of words like “CONTO” – but C is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, N and T need to fit.

Actually, we need to ensure both N and T appear somewhere in the word, and O is fixed in position 2.

One approach: list all 5-letter words with O in position 2, then filter those that contain both N and T, and exclude any containing A, R, S, E, P, I.

Let’s try:
- “BOUND” – but U is allowed, B is allowed, O is fixed in 2nd spot, U is allowed, N and T are present. However, this word has O in position 2, but we need to check if it fits all constraints:
  - B (allowed), O (position 2, correct), U (allowed), N (must be present), D (allowed). But does it have T? No, it has D. So “BOUND” is out.

- “CLOUD” – same issue, no T.

- “FOUNT” – F (allowed), O (position 2), U (allowed), N (must be present), T (must be present). This word has both N and T, and O in position 2, and none of the forbidden letters (A,R,S,E,P,I). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- F – not ruled out.
- O – correct position 2.
- U – not ruled out.
- N – must be present (and it is).
- T – must be present (and it is).

And “FOUNT” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, my next guess is “FOUNT”.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(-)  
Guess 3: FOUNT → F(x) O(✓) U(-) N(-) T(-)

1. O is fixed in position 2: _ O _ _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F  
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: N, T, U  
   - From FOUNT: U is in the word but not in position 3 (because it got “-”).  
   - From POINT: N is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - From FOUNT: N is also not in position 3 (same “-”).  
   - From POINT: T is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - From FOUNT: T is also not in position 5 (same “-”).  

So:
- Positions 1,3,4,5 are still open for N, T, U.  
- The word must contain N, T, U plus one more letter (since O is already placed).  
- The remaining letter must be chosen from the still-allowed consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A,R,S,E,P,I,F).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ _ _ that contains N, T, U and one more consonant, with no repeats of any ruled-out letters.

Let’s list possible placements of N, T, U across positions 1,3,4,5, ensuring they don’t go where they’ve been ruled out:

- N cannot be in 3 or 4 (from FOUNT and POINT). So N can only be in 1 or 5.  
- T cannot be in 5. So T can be in 1,3,4.  
- U cannot be in 3 (from FOUNT). So U can be in 1,4,5.

     Jotun is a valid 5-letter word (a Norse giant).

Let’s verify “JOTUN”:
- J – allowed (not ruled out).  
- O – correct in position 2.  
- T – must be present, in position 3 here.  
- U – must be present, in position 4 here.  
- N – must be present, in position 5 here.  

No letters from the forbidden list (A,R,S,E,P,I,F) are used. It fits all constraints.

5. N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 5).

So far we have:

- Pattern: _ O T U _
- Letters known to be in the word: O, T, U, N
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, F, J
- N must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 1 and 5. Since it cannot be in 5 (from JOTUN feedback), N must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be N O T U _.

Now we need a 5-letter word that starts with NOTU and ends with a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not in {A,R,S,E,P,I,F,J})
- Has not yet appeared (so not O, T, U, N)

Allowed letters for position 5: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Valid English words that fit N O T U _:
- NOTUM (but this is a rare variant; check dictionary)
- NOTCH
- NOTED
- NOTED is valid
- NOTCH is valid

Between these, NOTCH is more common.

Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed
- O in 2: allowed
- T in 3: allowed
- U in 4: allowed
- C in 5: not ruled out

The goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English 5-letter words, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).\n\nOne of the best starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and can help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.\n\nAnother strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly preferred as it covers more unique vowels.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSo we now know:\n1.

A good candidate is ""POINT"":\n- Contains O (in position 2, which is allowed since position 3 is the only restriction so far).\n- Uses P, I, N, T which are all still possible letters.\n\nAnother check: ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T.
