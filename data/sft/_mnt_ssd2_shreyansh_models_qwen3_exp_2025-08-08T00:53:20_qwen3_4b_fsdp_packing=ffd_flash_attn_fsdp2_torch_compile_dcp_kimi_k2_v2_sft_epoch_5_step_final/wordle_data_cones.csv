For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
- C is a common consonant
- R is very common
- A is a common vowel
- N is common
- E is the most common letter in English

This should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C is correct in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word looks like: C _ _ _ _ with N and E somewhere inside, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible positions for N: 2, 3, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 1 is already C, so 2, 3, 4)

Also, we know R and A are not in the word, so we can avoid those letters.

Let me think of words that start with C and contain both N and E, but not A or R. Some possibilities:
- C N _ _ E (but E can't be in 5)
- C _ N _ E (but E can't be in 5)
- C _ _ N E (but E can't be in 5)
- C E _ _ N
- C _ E _ N
- C _ _ E N

Looking at these, ""CENSE"" comes to mind (C E N S E), but it has E in position 5 which is invalid. ""CENSE"" is invalid because E can't be in position 5.

Next, ""COWER"" has R which we know is invalid. ""COVEN"" has A which is invalid (but A isn't in COVEN, so that's okay - but we know A is invalid, so we need to avoid A).

Looking at ""COVEN"":
- C(✓) O _ V E N
But we don't know about O, V yet. Also, N is in position 5 which is allowed (original N was in position 4, so position 5 is new).

But we need to check if this is a valid word and if we can confirm letters. Maybe better to try ""CLOVE"" but that has O and V which we haven't tested.

Alternatively, ""CUPEN"" isn't a word. ""CIVEN"" isn't a word. ""COPEN"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's think systematically. We have:
C _ _ _ _ with N and E inside, not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

Possible words:
- C N E _ _ (but then E is in position 3 which is allowed)
- C _ N E _ (E in position 4 which is allowed)
- C _ _ N E (E in position 5 which is invalid)
- C E _ N _ (E in position 2 which is allowed)
- C _ E N _ (E in position 3 which is allowed)
- C _ _ E N (E in position 4 which is allowed)

Looking at these patterns, ""CNEON"" isn't a word. ""CENTE"" isn't a word. ""CENET"" isn't a word.

Let me think of actual words:
- ""CENSE"" - invalid (E in 5)
- ""COWER"" - has R (invalid)
- ""COVEN"" - C O V E N
  - C(✓) O _ V E N
  - N is in position 5 (original N was in 4, so new position is allowed)
  - E is in position 4 (original E was in 5, so new position is allowed)
  - O and V are new letters to test
  - No A or R

This seems like a good next guess to test O and V while placing N and E in new positions.

Another option is ""CLEFT"" but that has F which we haven't tested, and we might prefer to test O and V first.

Thus, ""COVEN"" seems like a strong next guess.

- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
C O _ E _
with N still required somewhere, but not in position 5.

Remaining positions to fill: 3 and 5.
Allowed letters must include N (not in 5), and must exclude R, A, V.

Possible placements for N:
- Position 3: C O N E _
- Position 5: C O _ E N (but N was marked “-” for position 5, so this is invalid)

Hence N must be in position 3, making the word C O N E _.

Now only position 5 is unknown. It must be a letter not yet eliminated: not A, R, V. Common remaining consonants include S, T, L, D, etc.

Testing “S” gives CONES – a valid English word.",Guess 3: CONES -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
