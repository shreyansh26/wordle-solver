### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- A is not in the word at all (x).
- I is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.

- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (position 3 is invalid for E, but position 4 is allowed). However, E appears twice, so one of them must be in position 4 (which is allowed), and the other could be in position 3 (but that would be invalid). This might not be optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- I is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
- Excludes R, A, I.

Good next candidates would use common letters not yet eliminated. Let’s try:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – S in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed, so skip).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – contains I (disallowed).
- SPEND (S, P, E, N, D) – S in position 1 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no R/A/I.
- SPECK (S, P, E, C, K) – S in position 1 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no R/A/I.

SPEND seems good because it places S in position 1 and E in position 3, and introduces new common consonants (P, N, D) and a vowel (none beyond E).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Word does NOT contain: R, A, I.
   - Word DOES contain: S and E, but both are in wrong positions.

2. SPEND → S(-) P(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - Word does NOT contain: P, N, D.
   - Word DOES contain: S (still wrong position) and E (still wrong position).

Known constraints so far:
- Must contain S and E.
- Must NOT contain R, A, I, P, N, D.
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word using only the allowed letters, containing both S and E, and respecting the positional restrictions.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4:
- _ S _ E _

Fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants. Good candidates:
- T, L, C, K, M, etc.

A word that fits: STOLE
- S in position 1 (invalid, we can’t use position 1 for S).
- So try S in position 2: _ S _ _ _

Try: HOSTS – but S is in position 5 (allowed), but we need E somewhere.
Try: SHOES – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: COVES – no S.
Try: TESLA – contains A (invalid).
Try: SHELF – no S in position 2, but S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: LENSE – contains N (invalid).
Try: STEAK – contains A (invalid).
Try: SMELT – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEMS – S in position 4 (invalid).
Try: STOVE – no E in position 4.
Try: SWEET – S in position 1 (invalid), and E in position 5 (invalid).
Try: SLOPE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: SPOKE – contains P (invalid).
Try: STOLE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: SWORE – contains R (invalid).
Try: SITES – contains I (invalid).
Try: SLEET – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEEL – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEPS – no E.
Try: STEAK – contains A (invalid).
Try: STEMS – no E.
Try: STENO – contains N (invalid).
Try: STENT – contains N (invalid).
Try: STEPS – no E.
Try: STICK – no E.
Try: STILE – contains I (invalid).
Try: STONE – contains N (invalid).
Try: STOLE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STOKE – contains K and O, no invalid letters, and E in position 5 (invalid).
Try: STOIC – contains I (invalid).
Try: STORM – contains R (invalid).
Try: STOWS – no E.
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWINE – contains I and N (invalid).
Try: SWORE – contains R (invalid).
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWISS – no E.
Try: TWEES – contains W, T, E, E, S – E in position 4 (ok), S in position 5 (ok). No invalid letters (R, A, I, P, N, D are absent). This seems valid.

Check TWEES:
- Letters: T, W, E, E, S – all allowed.
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (position 3 is invalid for E, but position 4 is allowed). However, E appears twice, so one of them must be in position 4 (which is allowed), and the other could be in position 3 (but that would be invalid). This might not be optimal.

Better: Try a word with single E and S in allowed positions.
Try: CREST – contains R (invalid).
Try: CLASP – contains A (invalid).
Try: CLOSE – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 5 (invalid). Also, L, O, C are allowed.
Try: COMES – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). Letters: C, O, M, E, S – none of the forbidden letters. This fits all constraints:
   - Contains S and E.
   - S in position 5 (not 1 or 4).
   - E in position 4 (not 3 or 5).
   - No R, A, I, P, N, D.

- HOLES – H, O, L, E, S → ""holes"" is a valid English word.
- JOLES – no standard word.
- KOLES – no standard word.
- LOSES – L, O, S, E, S – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 3, which may conflict with existing feedback (but no feedback against it).
- TOLES – T, O, L, E, S – ""toles"" is a valid variant of ""toles"" (plural of tole).

Between HOLES and TOLES, both are valid, but TOLES is less common. HOLES is more common.

Let’s check HOLES:
- H, O, L, E, S.

Try: SWISH – no E.

Try: SWISS – no E.
Try: TWEES – contains W, T, E, E, S – E in position 4 (ok), S in position 5 (ok). No invalid letters (R, A, I, P, N, D are absent). This seems valid.

Check TWEES:
- Letters: T, W, E, E, S – all allowed.
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (position 3 is invalid for E, but position 4 is allowed). However, E appears twice, so one of them must be in position 4 (which is allowed), and the other could be in position 3 (but that would be invalid). This might not be optimal.

Better: Try a word with single E and S in allowed positions.
Try: CREST – contains R (invalid).
Try: CLASP – contains A (invalid).
Try: CLOSE – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 5 (invalid). Also, L, O, C are allowed.
Try: COMES – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). Letters: C, O, M, E, S – none of the forbidden letters. This fits all constraints:
   - Contains S and E.
   - S in position 5 (not 1 or 4).
   - E in position 4 (not 3 or 5).
   - No R, A, I, P, N, D.

COMES seems like a strong next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: COMES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on COMES:
- C is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is O.
- M is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is E.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is S.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters already known to be in the word: O, E, S.
Letters already known NOT to be in the word: R, A, I, P, N, D, C, M.

Available letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has E in position 4.
- Has S in position 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters in positions 1 and 3.

Possible patterns: _ O _ E S

Let’s list valid words fitting this pattern:
- BOGES (B, O, G, E, S) – but G is allowed, E and S are correct positions. However, does this word exist? ""Boges"" is a surname, but may not be in standard word lists.
- FOGE S – no common word.
- GOLES – G, O, L, E, S → ""goles"" is Spanish for ""eyes"" but may not be valid English.
- HOLES – H, O, L, E, S → ""holes"" is a valid English word.
- JOLES – no standard word.
- KOLES – no standard word.
- LOSES – L, O, S, E, S – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 3, which may conflict with existing feedback (but no feedback against it).
- TOLES – T, O, L, E, S – ""toles"" is a valid variant of ""toles"" (plural of tole).

Between HOLES and TOLES, both are valid, but TOLES is less common. HOLES is more common.

Let’s check HOLES:
- H, O, L, E, S.
- All letters are allowed (H, L not in forbidden list).
- Fits the structure _ O _ E S.

Therefore, HOLES is a strong candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words. Some good options include:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is not in the word at all (x).
- I is not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes S and E (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
- Excludes R, A, I.

Good next candidates would use common letters not yet eliminated. Let’s try:
- STONE (S, T, O, N, E) – S in position 1 (allowed), E in position 5 (disallowed, so skip).
- SHINE (S, H, I, N, E) – contains I (disallowed).
- SPEND (S, P, E, N, D) – S in position 1 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no R/A/I.
- SPECK (S, P, E, C, K) – S in position 1 (ok), E in position 3 (ok), no R/A/I.

SPEND seems good because it places S in position 1 and E in position 3, and introduces new common consonants (P, N, D) and a vowel (none beyond E).

Guess 2: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Word does NOT contain: R, A, I.
   - Word DOES contain: S and E, but both are in wrong positions.

2. SPEND → S(-) P(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - Word does NOT contain: P, N, D.
   - Word DOES contain: S (still wrong position) and E (still wrong position).

Known constraints so far:
- Must contain S and E.
- Must NOT contain R, A, I, P, N, D.
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word using only the allowed letters, containing both S and E, and respecting the positional restrictions.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and E in position 4:
- _ S _ E _

Fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants. Good candidates:
- T, L, C, K, M, etc.

A word that fits: STOLE
- S in position 1 (invalid, we can’t use position 1 for S).
- So try S in position 2: _ S _ _ _

Try: HOSTS – but S is in position 5 (allowed), but we need E somewhere.
Try: SHOES – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: COVES – no S.
Try: TESLA – contains A (invalid).
Try: SHELF – no S in position 2, but S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: LENSE – contains N (invalid).
Try: STEAK – contains A (invalid).
Try: SMELT – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEMS – S in position 4 (invalid).
Try: STOVE – no E in position 4.
Try: SWEET – S in position 1 (invalid), and E in position 5 (invalid).
Try: SLOPE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: SPOKE – contains P (invalid).
Try: STOLE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: SWORE – contains R (invalid).
Try: SITES – contains I (invalid).
Try: SLEET – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEEL – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STEPS – no E.
Try: STEAK – contains A (invalid).
Try: STEMS – no E.
Try: STENO – contains N (invalid).
Try: STENT – contains N (invalid).
Try: STEPS – no E.
Try: STICK – no E.
Try: STILE – contains I (invalid).
Try: STONE – contains N (invalid).
Try: STOLE – S in position 1 (invalid).
Try: STOKE – contains K and O, no invalid letters, and E in position 5 (invalid).
Try: STOIC – contains I (invalid).
Try: STORM – contains R (invalid).
Try: STOWS – no E.
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWINE – contains I and N (invalid).
Try: SWORE – contains R (invalid).
Try: SWISH – no E.
Try: SWISS – no E.
Try: TWEES – contains W, T, E, E, S – E in position 4 (ok), S in position 5 (ok). No invalid letters (R, A, I, P, N, D are absent). This seems valid.

Check TWEES:
- Letters: T, W, E, E, S – all allowed.
- Contains both S and E.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in positions 3 and 4 (position 3 is invalid for E, but position 4 is allowed). However, E appears twice, so one of them must be in position 4 (which is allowed), and the other could be in position 3 (but that would be invalid). This might not be optimal.

Better: Try a word with single E and S in allowed positions.
Try: CREST – contains R (invalid).
Try: CLASP – contains A (invalid).
Try: CLOSE – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 5 (invalid). Also, L, O, C are allowed.
Try: COMES – S in position 5 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed). Letters: C, O, M, E, S – none of the forbidden letters. This fits all constraints:
   - Contains S and E.
   - S in position 5 (not 1 or 4).
   - E in position 4 (not 3 or 5).
   - No R, A, I, P, N, D.

COMES seems like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SPEND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) E(-) N(x) D(x)
Guess 3: COMES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on COMES:
- C is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is O.
- M is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is E.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is S.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters already known to be in the word: O, E, S.
Letters already known NOT to be in the word: R, A, I, P, N, D, C, M.

Available letters (from the alphabet excluding the forbidden ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has E in position 4.
- Has S in position 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters in positions 1 and 3.

Possible patterns: _ O _ E S

Let’s list valid words fitting this pattern:
- BOGES (B, O, G, E, S) – but G is allowed, E and S are correct positions. However, does this word exist? ""Boges"" is a surname, but may not be in standard word lists.
- FOGE S – no common word.
- GOLES – G, O, L, E, S → ""goles"" is Spanish for ""eyes"" but may not be valid English.
- HOLES – H, O, L, E, S → ""holes"" is a valid English word.
- JOLES – no standard word.
- KOLES – no standard word.
- LOSES – L, O, S, E, S – but S is already in position 5, and this would have S in position 3, which may conflict with existing feedback (but no feedback against it).
- TOLES – T, O, L, E, S – ""toles"" is a valid variant of ""toles"" (plural of tole).

Between HOLES and TOLES, both are valid, but TOLES is less common. HOLES is more common.

Let’s check HOLES:
- H, O, L, E, S.
- All letters are allowed (H, L not in forbidden list).
- Fits the structure _ O _ E S.

Therefore, HOLES is a strong candidate.

From the latest feedback on HOLES:
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is confirmed in position 2 (✓).

- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So the word structure is now:

- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

Letters already known to be in the word: O, E, S.
Letters already known NOT to be in the word: R, A, I, P, N, D, C, M, H, L.

Available letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E S.

Possible valid words:
- BOGES (B, O, G, E, S) – but ""boges"" is a surname, not sure if valid.
- FOGES – no standard word.
- JONES – J, O, N, E, S – but N is already excluded.
- TOGES – T, O, G, E, S – ""togen"" is not a word, ""tongs"" is but N is excluded.
- BOGES – as above, questionable.
- GOGES – G, O, G, E, S – not a word.
- BOGES – still questionable.

Looking again, maybe ""BOGUS"" but that has U in position 4 which is E, so no.

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ E S.

Let me think of valid English words:
- BOGUS – no, pattern is wrong.
- BOGES – possible surname, but let's see if there's a better one.
- TOLES – already tried, T is allowed, but L is excluded.
- GOLES – G, O, L, E, S – but L is excluded.
- FOGE S – no.
- KOLES – no.
- VOLES – V, O, L, E, S – L excluded.
- BOVES – no.
- BOGES – seems the only possible, but let's check if there's a more common word.

Actually, ""BOGUS"" is a word, but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Wait, let me think systematically. The only remaining letters are B, F, G, J, K, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z for positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations:
- B O G E S – ""BOGES"" (not standard)
- B O K E S – ""BOKES"" – surname
- T O G E S – ""TOGES"" – not standard
- T O B E S – ""TOBES"" – not standard
- F O G E S – ""FOGES"" – not standard
- G O B E S – ""GOBES"" – not standard
- V O G E S – ""VOGES"" – not standard
- W O G E S – ""WOGES"" – not standard
- B O U E S – ""BOUES"" – not standard
- T O U E S – ""TOUES"" – not standard
- G O U E S – ""GOUES"" – not standard
- J O U E S – ""JOUES"" – not standard
- K O U E S – ""KOUES"" – not standard
- B O V E S – ""BOVES"" – not standard
- F O V E S – ""FOVES"" – not standard
- G O V E S – ""GOVES"" – not standard
- T O V E S – ""TOVES"" – not standard
- W O V E S – ""WOVES"" – this is a valid word!

""WOVES"" is a valid English word meaning ""the fabric or material made by weaving.""

Check letters:
- W, O, V, E, S.
- All letters are allowed (W, V not in excluded list).
- Fits _ O _ E S pattern.

Therefore, WOVES is the best next guess.

T  O  G  E  S → “TOGES” (also not standard).  

But there is one more:  
G  O  B  E  S → “GOBES” (not standard either).  

Upon closer inspection, the only remaining valid English word fitting this exact pattern is:  
“BOGUS” – but its pattern is B O G U S, which does not match our required E in position 4.  

Realizing the constraints, the only remaining valid word is actually:  
“BOGES” (B, O, G, E, S) – even if uncommon, it is the only possible combination left.  

Therefore, the final guess must be “BOGES.”
