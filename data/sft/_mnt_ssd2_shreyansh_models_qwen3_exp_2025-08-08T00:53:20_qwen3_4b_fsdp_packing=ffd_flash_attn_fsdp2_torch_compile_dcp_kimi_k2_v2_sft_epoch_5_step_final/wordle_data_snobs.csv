For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be effective in narrowing down possibilities early.

Let me think about why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
2. Contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English words
4. The combination can quickly reveal which vowels are present and their positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain A, R, or E

- SPOIL (S, P, O, I, L) – S is in position 1 (allowed), O is in 3, no A/R/E
- STOIC (S, T, O, I, C) – same idea
- SMOKE – but has E (invalid)
- SONIC – has R? No, but has C and N
- SOLAR – has A (invalid)
- STONY – has N, T, Y

""SPOIL"" seems like a good next guess because:
- It places S in position 1 (a new position)
- Keeps O in position 3
- Introduces new letters P, I, L to test
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, E)

Remaining common consonants: T, N, D, C, B, G, H, M, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are accounted for; O is already used).

Possible combinations:
- S T O N E – but E is banned.
- S T O N K – valid.
- S C O R E – R and E banned.
- S H O C K – valid.
- S W O O N – O repeated, but that’s allowed; however N is fine.
- S W O R D – R banned.
- S T O N D – valid.

“STONK” is a strong candidate because:
- Uses common letters T, N, K.
- Fits S _ O _ _ pattern.
- No banned letters.

Another good one is “SHOCK”, but let’s try STONK first.

So:
- Position 4 cannot be N.
- N must appear somewhere else in the word. But positions 1,3 are taken by S and O, so N must be in position 2 or 5.

Remaining letters we can use (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be effective in narrowing down possibilities early.

Let me think about why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

With O fixed in the 3rd spot, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain A, R, or E

Possible patterns: _ _ O _ _

- SMOKE – but has E (invalid)
- SONIC – has R? No, but has C and N
- SOLAR – has A (invalid)
- STONY – has N, T, Y

""SPOIL"" seems like a good next guess because:
- It places S in position 1 (a new position)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more vowel-heavy which can be effective in narrowing down possibilities early.

Let me think about why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
2. Contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English words
4. The combination can quickly reveal which vowels are present and their positions

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word has an O in position 3.
2. It contains an S somewhere, but NOT in position 4 (since S was in position 4 in AROSE).
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

With O fixed in the 3rd spot, we need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position
- Contains S (but not in position 4)
- Does not contain A, R, or E

Possible patterns: _ _ O _ _
Let’s think of words that fit. For example:
- SPOIL (S, P, O, I, L) – S is in position 1 (allowed), O is in 3, no A/R/E
- STOIC (S, T, O, I, C) – same idea
- SMOKE – but has E (invalid)
- SONIC – has R? No, but has C and N
- SOLAR – has A (invalid)
- STONY – has N, T, Y

""SPOIL"" seems like a good next guess because:
- It places S in position 1 (a new position)
- Keeps O in position 3
- Introduces new letters P, I, L to test
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, R, E)

Let’s go with SPOIL.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:

1. Position 3 must be O (from AROSE).
2. Position 1 must be S (from SPOIL).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, L.
4. The word looks like: S _ O _ _

We still need two more letters (positions 2 and 5) from the remaining unused alphabet, excluding the banned letters.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, D, C, B, G, H, M, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are accounted for; O is already used).

Possible combinations:
- S T O N E – but E is banned.
- S T O N K – valid.
- S C O R E – R and E banned.
- S H O C K – valid.
- S W O O N – O repeated, but that’s allowed; however N is fine.
- S W O R D – R banned.
- S T O N D – valid.

“STONK” is a strong candidate because:
- Uses common letters T, N, K.
- Fits S _ O _ _ pattern.
- No banned letters.

Another good one is “SHOCK”, but let’s try STONK first.

Guess 3: STONK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>

Current constraints after three guesses:

1. Position 1: S (✓)
2. Position 3: O (✓)
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, P, I, L, T, K
4. The word looks like: S _ O _ _

From Guess 3 (STONK) we also learned that N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since N was in position 4 and got “-”).

So:
- Position 4 cannot be N.
- N must appear somewhere else in the word. But positions 1,3 are taken by S and O, so N must be in position 2 or 5.

Remaining letters we can use (excluding banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with letters not yet ruled out, and place N in either position 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S N O _ _  (N in position 2)
- S _ O _ N  (N in position 5)

Let’s explore both:

1. S N O _ _:
   - Need a 4th and 5th letter from remaining pool.
   - Common endings: SNOWY, SNOUT, SNOBS, etc.
   - SNOWY: uses W, Y (both allowed).
   - SNOBS: uses B, S – but S is already in position 1, and we can’t have S twice? Actually the rules don’t forbid repeated letters unless the feedback indicates it. So SNOBS is possible, but let’s see if we can do better.

2. S _ O _ N:
   - Need a 2nd and 4th letter.
   - Examples: SHOWN (H, W allowed), SCOWN (C, W allowed), etc.

“SHOWN” seems like a strong candidate:
- S(✓) H O(✓) W N
- Uses H and W which are still allowed.
- Places N in position 5 (allowed, since N was only marked “-” in position 4).

Let’s go with SHOWN.

Confirmed letters and positions:

- Position 2: N ✓
- Position 3: O ✓

Confirmed letters (but position unknown):

  Therefore position 4 ≠ O.

Letters ruled out entirely so far: A, R, E, P, I, L, T, K, H, W, D.

The only clean, common word left is SNOOF (though it’s a bit rare).  
Another candidate is SNOGS, but S is already used once.
