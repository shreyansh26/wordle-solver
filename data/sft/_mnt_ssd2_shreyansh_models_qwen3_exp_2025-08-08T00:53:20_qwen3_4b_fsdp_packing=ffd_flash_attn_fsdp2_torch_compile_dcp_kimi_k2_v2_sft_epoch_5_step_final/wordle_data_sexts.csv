For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- T is correct in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: S _ _ T _
2. Must contain E somewhere other than the last spot.
3. Cannot contain L or A.

Possible positions for E: 2nd or 3rd (since 5th is excluded).

Let’s try a word that fits S _ _ T _ and includes E in the 2nd position, while avoiding L and A. A good candidate is ""SEWER"":
- S(✓) fits position 1.
- E in position 2 satisfies the requirement (E is in the word but not in position 5).
- W and R are common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- T in position 4 is correct.
- Avoids L and A entirely.

""SEWER"" seems like a solid second guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

Current constraints:

- Must contain E exactly once (since the second E in SEWER was marked “-” = already present but wrong position)
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5 (because those positions gave “-” in prior guesses)
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, W, R

Therefore E must sit in position 3:
S _ E T _

Remaining letters to fill positions 2 and 5 must avoid L, A, W, R.  
Good common consonants left: N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

Try “SHEET” – but double E is unlikely.

Let's update the constraints after the third guess:

1. Pattern: S _ _ T _  (S and T are fixed in positions 1 and 4)
2. E must be present and NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because every placement so far has been “-”, meaning E exists but is not there).  
   The only remaining slot for E is position 3, but the feedback for SPENT showed E(-) in position 3.  
   Therefore, E must be in position 3, and the feedback “-” simply confirms it’s not elsewhere (which is contradictory; normally “-” means “in word but wrong spot”).  
   Re-reading the feedback:  
   - Guess 1: E(-) → E is in word but not in position 5  
   - Guess 2: E(✓) → E is in position 2 (but then second E in SEWER was (-), which would be consistent)  
   - Guess 3: E(-) → E is in word but not in position 3  

   Wait, the feedback for SEWER shows E(✓) in position 2, so E is definitely in position 2.  
   The second E in SEWER was marked (-), which is redundant because the first E was already ✓.  
   So the confirmed pattern is: S E _ T _

   Letters ruled out so far: L, A, W, R, P, N  
   Remaining letters to fill position 3: any except those six.  
   Common consonants left: D, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, Y, etc.

   A good next guess is “SEEDY”:
   - S E D T Y → fits S E _ T _  
   - D and Y are new letters not yet tested.  
   - Avoids all excluded letters.

   However, “SEEDY” is 5 letters and fits the pattern.  
   Another option is “SECTY” but C and Y are fine.  
   “SEEDY” seems straightforward.

   Let me double-check:  
   - S ✓ (position 1)  
   - E ✓ (position 2)  
   - D new letter  
   - T ✓ (position 4)  
   - Y new letter  

   No conflicts.  
   So I’ll go with “SEEDY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- T is correct in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: S _ _ T _
2. Must contain E somewhere other than the last spot.
3. Cannot contain L or A.

Possible positions for E: 2nd or 3rd (since 5th is excluded).

Let’s try a word that fits S _ _ T _ and includes E in the 2nd position, while avoiding L and A. A good candidate is ""SEWER"":
- S(✓) fits position 1.
- E in position 2 satisfies the requirement (E is in the word but not in position 5).
- W and R are common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- T in position 4 is correct.
- Avoids L and A entirely.

""SEWER"" seems like a solid second guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ T _  (S fixed at 1, T fixed at 4)
- Must contain E exactly once (since the second E in SEWER was marked “-” = already present but wrong position)
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5 (because those positions gave “-” in prior guesses)
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, W, R

Therefore E must sit in position 3:
S _ E T _

Remaining letters to fill positions 2 and 5 must avoid L, A, W, R.  
Good common consonants left: N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

Try “SHEET” – but double E is unlikely.  
Try “SINET” – but I and N not yet tested.  
Try “SPENT” – P and N are fresh letters, and it satisfies all constraints.

SPENT:
- S ✓
- P untested
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- T ✓
- N untested
No forbidden letters appear.

Looks safe.

Let's distil the hard facts from the feedback so far:

   - 4th letter = T

2. Letters known NOT to appear anywhere:
   L, A, W, R, P, N, D, Y

3. The third letter (position 3) must be a consonant that:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- T is correct in the fourth position.
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: S _ _ T _
2. Must contain E somewhere other than the last spot.
3. Cannot contain L or A.

Possible positions for E: 2nd or 3rd (since 5th is excluded).

Let’s try a word that fits S _ _ T _ and includes E in the 2nd position, while avoiding L and A. A good candidate is ""SEWER"":
- S(✓) fits position 1.
- E in position 2 satisfies the requirement (E is in the word but not in position 5).
- W and R are common letters we haven’t tested yet.
- T in position 4 is correct.
- Avoids L and A entirely.

""SEWER"" seems like a solid second guess to narrow down the remaining letters.

Guess 2: SEWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) W(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|>

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ T _  (S fixed at 1, T fixed at 4)
- Must contain E exactly once (since the second E in SEWER was marked “-” = already present but wrong position)
- E cannot be in position 2 or 5 (because those positions gave “-” in prior guesses)
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, W, R

Therefore E must sit in position 3:
S _ E T _

Remaining letters to fill positions 2 and 5 must avoid L, A, W, R.  
Good common consonants left: N, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, etc.

Try “SHEET” – but double E is unlikely.  
Try “SINET” – but I and N not yet tested.  
Try “SPENT” – P and N are fresh letters, and it satisfies all constraints.

SPENT:
- S ✓
- P untested
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- T ✓
- N untested
No forbidden letters appear.

Looks safe.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: SEWER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) W(x) E(-) R(x)
Guess 3: SPENT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) E(-) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update the constraints after the third guess:

1. Pattern: S _ _ T _  (S and T are fixed in positions 1 and 4)
2. E must be present and NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because every placement so far has been “-”, meaning E exists but is not there).  
   The only remaining slot for E is position 3, but the feedback for SPENT showed E(-) in position 3.  
   Therefore, E must be in position 3, and the feedback “-” simply confirms it’s not elsewhere (which is contradictory; normally “-” means “in word but wrong spot”).  
   Re-reading the feedback:  
   - Guess 1: E(-) → E is in word but not in position 5  
   - Guess 2: E(✓) → E is in position 2 (but then second E in SEWER was (-), which would be consistent)  
   - Guess 3: E(-) → E is in word but not in position 3  

   Wait, the feedback for SEWER shows E(✓) in position 2, so E is definitely in position 2.  
   The second E in SEWER was marked (-), which is redundant because the first E was already ✓.  
   So the confirmed pattern is: S E _ T _

   Letters ruled out so far: L, A, W, R, P, N  
   Remaining letters to fill position 3: any except those six.  
   Common consonants left: D, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, Y, etc.

   A good next guess is “SEEDY”:
   - S E D T Y → fits S E _ T _  
   - D and Y are new letters not yet tested.  
   - Avoids all excluded letters.

   However, “SEEDY” is 5 letters and fits the pattern.  
   Another option is “SECTY” but C and Y are fine.  
   “SEEDY” seems straightforward.

   Let me double-check:  
   - S ✓ (position 1)  
   - E ✓ (position 2)  
   - D new letter  
   - T ✓ (position 4)  
   - Y new letter  

   No conflicts.  
   So I’ll go with “SEEDY”.

Let's distil the hard facts from the feedback so far:

1. Positions locked:
   - 1st letter = S
   - 2nd letter = E
   - 4th letter = T

   So the pattern is: S E _ T _

2. Letters known NOT to appear anywhere:
   L, A, W, R, P, N, D, Y

3. The third letter (position 3) must be a consonant that:
   - hasn’t been ruled out
   - hasn’t already been placed (none have)

4. Remaining consonants that haven’t been tried and aren’t excluded:
   B, C, F, G, H, K, M, V, Z (and a few others)

5. The simplest valid 5-letter word fitting S E _ T _ from that pool is “SECTT” – but that’s not a word.  
   “SECT” is 4 letters.  
   Real 5-letter words include:
   - S E C T _  → “SECTS” (but S already used in position 1)  
   - S E C T O  → “SECTO” (not a common word)  
   - S E C T S  → invalid (double S)  
   - S E C T A  → “SECTA” (rare)  
   - S E C T I  → “SECTI” (rare)  

   Another run:  
   S E B T _  → “SEBUT” (no)  
   S E F T _  → “SEFTS” (no)  
   S E G T _  → “SEGOT” (no)  
   S E H T _  → “SEHTS” (no)  
   S E K T _  → “SEKTS” (no)  
   S E M T _  → “SEMOT” (no)  
   S E V T _  → “SEVTS” (no)  

   Realisation: most consonants give no valid word.  
   The only common 5-letter word that fits S E _ T _ and uses an unused consonant is “SECTS” – but it repeats S.  
   Next best: “SEFTS” (but F and S are fine, yet not a common word).  
   Another candidate: “SEKTS” (K not tried, but again rare).  

   Let’s list every valid 5-letter word matching S E _ T _ and check which consonants are used:

   - S E C T S → invalid (S repeated)  
   - S E C T O → 4 letters  
   - S E C T A → 5 letters but rare  
   - S E B T H → “SEBTH” (no)  
   - S E F T Y → Y excluded  
   - S E G T H → “SEGTH” (no)  
   - S E H T H → “SEHTH” (no)  
   - S E K T S → invalid  
   - S E M T O → “SEMTO” (no)  
   - S E M T E → “SEMTE” (no)  
   - S E M T S → invalid  
   - S E M T O → “SEMTO” (no)  

   Re-examine: the only dictionary-valid 5-letter word in standard English that matches S E _ T _ and uses an allowed consonant is “SECTS”.  
   Even though it re-uses S, it’s the only plausible candidate.  
   Therefore, we must guess “SECTS”.
