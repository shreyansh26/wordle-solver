From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word (already noted).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E.
- Still needs three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5) from remaining unused letters.

Good next steps:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try common remaining consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

A word that fits: STAIN
- S in position 1 (was in position 4, so new position is allowed).
- T, I, N are common unused letters.
- A in position 3 (was in position 1, so new position is allowed).
- No R, O, E.

But STAIN has S in position 1, which was not ruled out (only position 4 was ruled out for S). This is fine.

Another option: SANTI (but this is not a valid word).
Another option: SAINT - valid word, uses S, A, I, N, T.
- S in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 was ruled out for S).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since position 1 was ruled out for A).
- I, N, T are new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common consonants and vowels. However, another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.

- E is not in the word (already noted).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E.
- Still needs three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5) from remaining unused letters.

Good next steps:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try common remaining consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

A word that fits: STAIN

with I still to place somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

We need two more distinct letters (not R, O, E, N, T) to fill positions 3, 4 or 5. The remaining common consonants include L, D, C, G, B, M, etc., and the remaining vowel is U (since A and I are already used, and O, E are out).

A good candidate is “SABIN” but N is already ruled out.  
“SACID” – but D and C are fine, but I is in position 3 which is disallowed.  
“SAINT” already tried.  
“SAVIL” – V and L are fine, but I is in position 3 again.  
“SAILS” – repeats S, and I is in position 3.  
“SAIKO” – O is out.  
“SAIKU” – uses K and U, both allowed, and I is in position 3 – still bad.  
“SAIKY” – Y is allowed, but I is in position 3.  
“SAID_” – D is allowed, but I is in position 3.  

We need I in position 4 or 5.

Try “SALID” – I in position 4, L and D new.  
Check dictionary: SALID is not a common word.  
“SALTY” – T is out.  
“SAPID” – I in position 4, P and D new.  
SAPID is a valid word (meaning flavorful) and fits all constraints:

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters known to be in the word: S, A, I  
- S is fixed in position 1.  
- A is fixed in position 2.  
- I must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in SAPID it was in position 4 and marked “-”).  
  Therefore I must be in position 5.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, N, T, P, D.

So the pattern is:
S A _ _ I

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the banned letters. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: U (only).

Let’s pick a pair that forms a valid word. Try:
- B and C → “SABCI” – not a word.  
- B and L → “SABLE” – but E is banned.  
- C and L → “SACLI” – not a word.

- Y and U → “SAWUI” – not a word.  

Try consonants that repeat or form a cluster.  
“SACUI” – not valid.  
“SABOT” – O and T banned.  
“SALON” – O and N banned.  
“SAUCE” – U and C allowed, but E banned.  
“SALTY” – T and Y – T banned.  
“SALVI” – V and I – I already used once, but that’s fine.  
“SALVI” is a valid word (relating to salvation).

Check constraints:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common consonants and vowels. However, another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word (already noted).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E.
- Still needs three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5) from remaining unused letters.

Good next steps:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try common remaining consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

A word that fits: STAIN
- S in position 1 (was in position 4, so new position is allowed).
- T, I, N are common unused letters.
- A in position 3 (was in position 1, so new position is allowed).
- No R, O, E.

But STAIN has S in position 1, which was not ruled out (only position 4 was ruled out for S). This is fine.

Another option: SANTI (but this is not a valid word).
Another option: SAINT - valid word, uses S, A, I, N, T.
- S in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 was ruled out for S).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since position 1 was ruled out for A).
- I, N, T are new letters.

SAINT seems better as it uses more common letters and is a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains several common consonants and vowels. However, another excellent choice is ""AROSE"" as it covers A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. 

After considering these, I think ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, E are NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word (already noted).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E.
- Still needs three more letters (positions 2, 3, 5) from remaining unused letters.

Good next steps:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Try common remaining consonants (T, N, L, D, C, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

A word that fits: STAIN
- S in position 1 (was in position 4, so new position is allowed).
- T, I, N are common unused letters.
- A in position 3 (was in position 1, so new position is allowed).
- No R, O, E.

But STAIN has S in position 1, which was not ruled out (only position 4 was ruled out for S). This is fine.

Another option: SANTI (but this is not a valid word).
Another option: SAINT - valid word, uses S, A, I, N, T.
- S in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 was ruled out for S).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since position 1 was ruled out for A).
- I, N, T are new letters.

SAINT seems better as it uses more common letters and is a valid word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S, A, I  
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).  
   - A is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.  

So the pattern so far is:
S A _ _ _  
with I still to place somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

We need two more distinct letters (not R, O, E, N, T) to fill positions 3, 4 or 5. The remaining common consonants include L, D, C, G, B, M, etc., and the remaining vowel is U (since A and I are already used, and O, E are out).

A good candidate is “SABIN” but N is already ruled out.  
“SACID” – but D and C are fine, but I is in position 3 which is disallowed.  
“SAINT” already tried.  
“SAVIL” – V and L are fine, but I is in position 3 again.  
“SAILS” – repeats S, and I is in position 3.  
“SAIKO” – O is out.  
“SAIKU” – uses K and U, both allowed, and I is in position 3 – still bad.  
“SAIKY” – Y is allowed, but I is in position 3.  
“SAID_” – D is allowed, but I is in position 3.  

We need I in position 4 or 5.

Try “SALID” – I in position 4, L and D new.  
Check dictionary: SALID is not a common word.  
“SALTY” – T is out.  
“SAPID” – I in position 4, P and D new.  
SAPID is a valid word (meaning flavorful) and fits all constraints:
- S (✓) A (✓) P _ I (in position 4) D (new).  

Let’s go with SAPID.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters known to be in the word: S, A, I  
- S is fixed in position 1.  
- A is fixed in position 2.  
- I must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (because in SAPID it was in position 4 and marked “-”).  
  Therefore I must be in position 5.

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, N, T, P, D.

So the pattern is:
S A _ _ I

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding the banned letters. Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: U (only).

Let’s pick a pair that forms a valid word. Try:
- B and C → “SABCI” – not a word.  
- B and L → “SABLE” – but E is banned.  
- C and L → “SACLI” – not a word.  
- G and L → “SAGLI” – not a word.  
- L and K → “SALKI” – not a word.  
- B and K → “SABKI” – not a word.  
- C and K → “SACKI” – not a word.  
- B and U → “SABUI” – not a word.  
- C and U → “SACUI” – not a word.  
- G and U → “SAGUI” – not a word.  
- L and U → “SALUI” – not a word.  
- M and U → “SAMUI” – not a word.  
- K and U → “SAKUI” – not a word.  
- F and U → “SAFUI” – not a word.  
- H and U → “SAHUI” – not a word.  
- V and U → “SAVUI” – not a word.  
- W and U → “SAWUI” – not a word.  
- Y and U → “SAWUI” – not a word.  

Try consonants that repeat or form a cluster.  
“SACUI” – not valid.  
“SABOT” – O and T banned.  
“SALON” – O and N banned.  
“SAUCE” – U and C allowed, but E banned.  
“SALTY” – T and Y – T banned.  
“SALVI” – V and I – I already used once, but that’s fine.  
“SALVI” is a valid word (relating to salvation).

Check constraints:
- S A _ _ I  
- Positions 3 and 4: L and V are allowed.  
- I is in position 5 – satisfies “-” feedback from previous rounds.  

So “SALVI” fits perfectly.

We now have five rounds of feedback. Summarizing what we know:

1. Fixed positions:
   - Position 1: S ✓
   - Position 2: A ✓
   - Position 5: I ✓

   So the word looks like: S A _ _ I

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   R, O, E, N, T, P, D, L, V, C, H

3. Remaining letters that have never been tried (and are therefore still possible):
   B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

4. We need two distinct letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 3 and 4, forming a valid 5-letter English word that starts with SA and ends with I.

5. Scanning the remaining letters for common combinations:
   - B and K → “SABKI” – invalid
   - B and M → “SABMI” – invalid
   - F and K → “SAFKI” – invalid
   - G and K → “SAGKI” – invalid
   - J and K → “SAJKI” – invalid
   - K and M → “SAKMI” – invalid
   - M and K → “SAMKI” – invalid
   - B and G → “SABGI” – invalid
   - F and M → “SAFM I” – invalid
   - G and M → “SAGMI” – invalid
   - K and U → “SAKUI” – invalid
   - M and U → “SAMUI” – invalid
   - B and U → “SABUI” – invalid
   - F and U → “SAFUI” – invalid
   - G and U → “SAGUI” – invalid
   - K and Y → “SAK Y I” – invalid
   - M and Y → “SAM Y I” – invalid

6. The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern S A _ _ I and uses letters not yet ruled out is “SABBI” (a variant spelling of “sabbi” or “sabbī”), but this is obscure. However, another valid word is “SAMBI” (a type of plant or a surname), but again obscure.

7. Rechecking: the pattern is S A _ _ I. The only common English word fitting this pattern with remaining letters is “SAMBI” (but it’s not in standard dictionaries). Another possibility is “SABBI” (also rare).

8. Realizing that “SABBI” and “SAMBI” are both valid in Scrabble dictionaries, but we need to choose the more common one. Between these, “SAMBI” is slightly more common as a surname/variant.

However, upon deeper reflection, the only remaining valid English word fitting S A _ _ I with the allowed letters is “SABBI” (as “SAMBI” is not recognized by major dictionaries). Therefore, we must guess “SABBI”.

But wait—let’s double-check: the letters B and B are allowed (B has never been tried), and it forms the word “SABBI”. This is the only logical remaining choice.

Therefore, the next guess is “SABBI”.
