For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T
- Letters confirmed in the word: Y (and it is in the 5th position)
- Letters that are somewhere in the word but not yet placed: N and I

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ Y with N and I still to place, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T allowed.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Z, plus N, I, Y.

We need to place N and I in positions 1-4, and fill the remaining spot with one of the allowed consonants.

Possible placements:
- N and I could be in any order in positions 1-4, with one consonant.
- Let’s try a word that uses N and I plus a common consonant like L or D.

Candidate words:
- NILDY (but D is allowed, but this uses L which is allowed)
- INNYD (invalid, has D at end which is Y)
- PINNY (uses P, I, N, N, Y – but has two N’s, and P is allowed)
- WINNY (W, I, N, N, Y – but W is allowed)
- MINCY (but C is allowed, but Y is last)
- FLING (but G is allowed, but Y is last)

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending with Y, with N and I somewhere in the first 4, and no forbidden letters.

Let me think of valid words ending with Y, containing N and I, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Possible words:
- PINNY – P, I, N, N, Y → uses P (allowed), I, N, Y. Has two N’s, but N is confirmed in word.
- WINNY – W, I, N, N, Y → similar.
- MINCY – M, I, N, C, Y → uses C (allowed), but C is not confirmed yet.
- FLING – F, L, I, N, G → but Y is last, so FLING is 5 letters ending with G, not Y.
- BLIND – B, L, I, N, D → ends with D, not Y.
- CLING – C, L, I, N, G → ends with G.
- SLING – S is ruled out.
- PLINY – P, L, I, N, Y → ends with Y, uses P, L, I, N. All letters allowed (P, L, I, N, Y), and contains N and I.

""PLINY"" seems like a good choice:
- P (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- I (must be in word, confirmed)
- N (must be in word, confirmed)
- Y (confirmed in 5th position)

This tests positions for I and N, and introduces L as a new consonant.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses letters not yet eliminated.  
- Still includes common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing things down.

Good remaining frequent letters: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y.

A balanced word with three consonants and two vowels:  
“UNITY” – uses U, N, I, T, Y. None of these were in AROSE, so they’re all fresh.  
It also has two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y), giving broad coverage.

Alternative candidates: “UNTIL”, “DUMPY”, “LUNGI”, but “UNITY” feels most balanced.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T
- Letters confirmed in the word: Y (and it is in the 5th position)
- Letters that are somewhere in the word but not yet placed: N and I

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ Y with N and I still to place, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T allowed.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Z, plus N, I, Y.

We need to place N and I in positions 1-4, and fill the remaining spot with one of the allowed consonants.

Possible placements:
- N and I could be in any order in positions 1-4, with one consonant.
- Let’s try a word that uses N and I plus a common consonant like L or D.

Candidate words:
- NILDY (but D is allowed, but this uses L which is allowed)
- INNYD (invalid, has D at end which is Y)
- PINNY (uses P, I, N, N, Y – but has two N’s, and P is allowed)
- WINNY (W, I, N, N, Y – but W is allowed)
- MINCY (but C is allowed, but Y is last)
- FLING (but G is allowed, but Y is last)

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending with Y, with N and I somewhere in the first 4, and no forbidden letters.

Let me think of valid words ending with Y, containing N and I, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Possible words:
- PINNY – P, I, N, N, Y → uses P (allowed), I, N, Y. Has two N’s, but N is confirmed in word.
- WINNY – W, I, N, N, Y → similar.
- MINCY – M, I, N, C, Y → uses C (allowed), but C is not confirmed yet.
- FLING – F, L, I, N, G → but Y is last, so FLING is 5 letters ending with G, not Y.
- BLIND – B, L, I, N, D → ends with D, not Y.
- CLING – C, L, I, N, G → ends with G.
- SLING – S is ruled out.
- PLINY – P, L, I, N, Y → ends with Y, uses P, L, I, N. All letters allowed (P, L, I, N, Y), and contains N and I.

""PLINY"" seems like a good choice:
- P (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- I (must be in word, confirmed)
- N (must be in word, confirmed)
- Y (confirmed in 5th position)

This tests positions for I and N, and introduces L as a new consonant.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This gives us good coverage to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means I must avoid A, R, O, S, E entirely.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses letters not yet eliminated.  
- Still includes common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing things down.

Good remaining frequent letters: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y.

A balanced word with three consonants and two vowels:  
“UNITY” – uses U, N, I, T, Y. None of these were in AROSE, so they’re all fresh.  
It also has two vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, Y), giving broad coverage.

Alternative candidates: “UNTIL”, “DUMPY”, “LUNGI”, but “UNITY” feels most balanced.

Guess 2: UNITY -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) I(-) T(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T
- Letters confirmed in the word: Y (and it is in the 5th position)
- Letters that are somewhere in the word but not yet placed: N and I

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ Y with N and I still to place, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T allowed.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Z, plus N, I, Y.

We need to place N and I in positions 1-4, and fill the remaining spot with one of the allowed consonants.

Possible placements:
- N and I could be in any order in positions 1-4, with one consonant.
- Let’s try a word that uses N and I plus a common consonant like L or D.

Candidate words:
- NILDY (but D is allowed, but this uses L which is allowed)
- INNYD (invalid, has D at end which is Y)
- PINNY (uses P, I, N, N, Y – but has two N’s, and P is allowed)
- WINNY (W, I, N, N, Y – but W is allowed)
- MINCY (but C is allowed, but Y is last)
- FLING (but G is allowed, but Y is last)

Wait, we need exactly 5 letters ending with Y, with N and I somewhere in the first 4, and no forbidden letters.

Let me think of valid words ending with Y, containing N and I, and no A, R, O, S, E, U, T.

Possible words:
- PINNY – P, I, N, N, Y → uses P (allowed), I, N, Y. Has two N’s, but N is confirmed in word.
- WINNY – W, I, N, N, Y → similar.
- MINCY – M, I, N, C, Y → uses C (allowed), but C is not confirmed yet.
- FLING – F, L, I, N, G → but Y is last, so FLING is 5 letters ending with G, not Y.
- BLIND – B, L, I, N, D → ends with D, not Y.
- CLING – C, L, I, N, G → ends with G.
- SLING – S is ruled out.
- PLINY – P, L, I, N, Y → ends with Y, uses P, L, I, N. All letters allowed (P, L, I, N, Y), and contains N and I.

""PLINY"" seems like a good choice:
- P (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- I (must be in word, confirmed)
- N (must be in word, confirmed)
- Y (confirmed in 5th position)

This tests positions for I and N, and introduces L as a new consonant.

From the new feedback:

- Letters still ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, P, L  
- Letters confirmed in the word: Y (position 5), I (somewhere), N (somewhere)  
- Letters yet to be tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Z  

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ Y, and we still need to place both I and N somewhere in positions 1-4, using only the untested consonants.

Possible placements:
- I and N must occupy two of the first four positions, in some order.
- The remaining two slots must be filled from the still-allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter English word ending in Y that contains both I and N (each once) plus two other untested consonants.

Candidate words:
- FINCH → ends in H, not Y  
- MINCY → C is untested, but Y is last; contains I and N → M, I, N, C, Y  
  – All letters are allowed (M, I, N, C, Y)  
  – Uses I and N, places them in positions 2 and 3  
  – Introduces C (new, untested)  

No other obvious word fits better, so I’ll go with MINCY.

From the new feedback:

- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – I in position 2  
  – N in position 3  
  – Y in position 5  

- Letters ruled out so far:  
  A, R, O, S, E, U, T, P, L, M, C  

- Remaining untested consonants for positions 1 and 4:  
  B, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, X, Z  

The pattern is now: _ I N _ Y

We need two distinct consonants for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- B and D → BINDY  
- B and G → BINGY  
- F and D → FINDY  
- G and D → GINDY  
- H and D → HINDY  
- K and D → KINDY  
- V and D → VINDY  
- W and D → WINDY  

""WINDY"" is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters (W, I, N, D, Y). It fits the pattern perfectly.

Other options like ""KINDY"" or ""BINGY"" are also valid, but ""WINDY"" is more common.

So I'll guess WINDY.
