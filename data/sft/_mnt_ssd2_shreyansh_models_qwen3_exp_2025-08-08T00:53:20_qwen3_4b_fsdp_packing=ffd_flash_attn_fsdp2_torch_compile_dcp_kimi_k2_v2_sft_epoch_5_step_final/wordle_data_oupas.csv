For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the top 10 most common in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. This combination has been statistically shown to be effective in Wordle-type games

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, O, S
- Letters to exclude: R, E
- Positions to avoid for A (1), O (3), S (4).

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S (and possibly others not yet ruled out).
2. Does not contain R or E.
3. Places A, O, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidates for the remaining two letters are common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Let me try to place A, O, S in allowed spots and add two new consonants.

One strong candidate is “SALON”:
- S in position 1 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 4).
- A in position 2 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 1).
- L (new letter) in position 3.
- O in position 4 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 3).
- N (new letter) in position 5.

This covers the known letters and introduces two new common consonants.

Known facts:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N.
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

So the three required letters must fit into the remaining five slots without violating those bans, and we need two more consonants that are not R, E, L, N.

Available positions for A: 3, 4, 5  
Available positions for O: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for S: 2, 3, 5

- If A is in 3, then O and S must go in 1/2/5 and 2/5 without conflict.
  – O could be 1 or 2 or 5; S could be 2 or 5.
  – Trying O=1, S=2 → O S _ A _ → need two consonants, not R,E,L,N.
    Good consonants left: T, D, C, B, G, etc.
    One word that fits: O S _ A _ → “OSA**” – but we need a 5-letter word.
    Let’s try “OCTAS” – but that’s not a common word.
    Another option: “STO**” – but S is in 1 which is banned.
    Let’s try “COAST” – but it has two S’s, which is unlikely.
    Let’s try “COATS” – again two T’s? No, T is fine.
    Actually “COATS” uses C, O, A, T, S – all allowed letters, positions:
      C(1), O(2), A(3), T(4), S(5)
      Check bans:
        A not in 1 or 2 – ok (it’s in 3).
        O not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 2).
        S not in 1 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5).
        No R, E, L, N.
      “COATS” is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “CABOS” – but B is fine, but O would be in 4 which is banned.

  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

So the three required letters must fit into the remaining five slots without violating those bans, and we need two more consonants that are not R, E, L, N.

Available positions for A: 3, 4, 5  
Available positions for O: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s look for a valid placement:
- If A is in 3, then O and S must go in 1/2/5 and 2/5 without conflict.
  – O could be 1 or 2 or 5; S could be 2 or 5.
  – Trying O=1, S=2 → O S _ A _ → need two consonants, not R,E,L,N.
    Good consonants left: T, D, C, B, G, etc.
    One word that fits: O S _ A _ → “OSA**” – but we need a 5-letter word.
    Let’s try “OCTAS” – but that’s not a common word.
    Another option: “STO**” – but S is in 1 which is banned.
    Let’s try “COAST” – but it has two S’s, which is unlikely.
    Let’s try “COATS” – again two T’s? No, T is fine.
    Actually “COATS” uses C, O, A, T, S – all allowed letters, positions:
      C(1), O(2), A(3), T(4), S(5)
      Check bans:
        A not in 1 or 2 – ok (it’s in 3).
        O not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 2).
        S not in 1 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5).
        No R, E, L, N.
      “COATS” is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “CABOS” – but B is fine, but O would be in 4 which is banned.
“SACOS” – S in 1 banned.
“SALTO” – L is banned.
“COAST” seems best.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word (each appears once):
- S is in position 5 (✓).

Letters NOT in the word:
R, E, L, N, C, T.

Letters still in play (must appear once each):
A, O, S (but S is already placed at 5).

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3.
- O cannot be in positions 3, 4.
- S is fixed at position 5.

So:
- A must be in position 4 (only remaining slot it hasn't been ruled out of).
- O must fit into position 1 or 2 (since 3,4 are banned and 4 is now taken by A if any).
- We need one more consonant that hasn't been eliminated.

Letters left to pick from (excluding banned ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's construct:
- Position 1: O (possible) or another consonant.
- Position 2: If O is here, then we need a consonant for position 3.
- Position 3: Consonant.
- Position 4: A (only possible spot left for A).
- Position 5: S.

So the word structure is: _ _ _ A S or O _ _ A S.

But O cannot be in position 3 or 4, so if we put O in position 1 or 2, it works.

Let's try O in position 1: O _ _ A S.

We need a consonant for position 2 and 3 that hasn't been banned. Let's pick common ones like B, D, G, etc.

Looking for valid words:
- O B B A S – not valid.
- O B I A S – not valid.
- O G L A S – L is banned.
- O D D A S – not valid.
- O B A A S – not valid.
- O B I T S – T is banned.
- O P A S – too short.
- O B A S – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Let's think differently: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- 4: A (fixed)
- 5: S (fixed)
- 1 or 2 must be O
- 3 must be a consonant
- 2 or 3 must be the other letter.

- D O G A S – not a word.
- F O G A S – not a word.
- M O G A S – not a word.

- D O G A S – not valid.
- F O G A S – not valid.
- H O G A S – not valid.
- M O G A S – not valid.
- P O G A S – not valid.

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words ending in AS with A in position 4 and S in 5, and O in 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- BOARS – but R is banned.
- DOARS – not a word.
- FOAMS – M is allowed, but O is in 2, A in 4, S in 5. Let's check:
  - F, O, A, M, S – all allowed letters.
  - Positions:
    - O in 2: allowed (not banned).
    - A in 4: allowed (only banned in 1,2,3).
    - S in 5: correct.
    - No banned letters.
  - ""FOAMS"" is a valid English word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the top 10 most common in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, O, S
- Letters to exclude: R, E
- Positions to avoid for A (1), O (3), S (4).

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S (and possibly others not yet ruled out).
2. Does not contain R or E.
3. Places A, O, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidates for the remaining two letters are common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Let me try to place A, O, S in allowed spots and add two new consonants.

One strong candidate is “SALON”:
- S in position 1 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 4).
- A in position 2 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 1).
- L (new letter) in position 3.
- O in position 4 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 3).
- N (new letter) in position 5.

This covers the known letters and introduces two new common consonants.

Known facts:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (each appears exactly once so far).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N.
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

So the three required letters must fit into the remaining five slots without violating those bans, and we need two more consonants that are not R, E, L, N.

Available positions for A: 3, 4, 5  
Available positions for O: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s look for a valid placement:
- If A is in 3, then O and S must go in 1/2/5 and 2/5 without conflict.
  – O could be 1 or 2 or 5; S could be 2 or 5.
  – Trying O=1, S=2 → O S _ A _ → need two consonants, not R,E,L,N.
    Good consonants left: T, D, C, B, G, etc.
    One word that fits: O S _ A _ → “OSA**” – but we need a 5-letter word.
    Let’s try “OCTAS” – but that’s not a common word.
    Another option: “STO**” – but S is in 1 which is banned.
    Let’s try “COAST” – but it has two S’s, which is unlikely.
    Let’s try “COATS” – again two T’s? No, T is fine.
    Actually “COATS” uses C, O, A, T, S – all allowed letters, positions:
      C(1), O(2), A(3), T(4), S(5)
      Check bans:
        A not in 1 or 2 – ok (it’s in 3).
        O not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 2).
        S not in 1 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5).
        No R, E, L, N.
      “COATS” is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “CABOS” – but B is fine, but O would be in 4 which is banned.
“SACOS” – S in 1 banned.
“SALTO” – L is banned.

- O D A S – not valid.
- O H A S – not valid.
- O P A S – not valid.
- O V A S – not valid.

Hmm, maybe we need a different consonant. Let's try G in position 3.

For _ O G A S:
- B O G A S – not a word.
- D O G A S – not a word.
- F O G A S – not a word.
- M O G A S – not a word.
- P O G A S – not a word.

Wait, maybe we need to use I or U as a vowel. Let's try:

Structure: _ _ _ A S with A at 4, S at 5, O must be in 1 or 2.

Let's try O in position 2:
- _ O _ A S

Possible words:
- B O G A S – not valid.
- D O G A S – not valid.
- F O G A S – not valid.
- H O G A S – not valid.
- M O G A S – not valid.
- P O G A S – not valid.

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words ending in AS with A in position 4 and S in 5, and O in 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- BOARS – but R is banned.
- DOARS – not a word.
- FOAMS – M is allowed, but O is in 2, A in 4, S in 5. Let's check:
  - F, O, A, M, S – all allowed letters.
  - Positions:
    - O in 2: allowed (not banned).
    - A in 4: allowed (only banned in 1,2,3).
    - S in 5: correct.
    - No banned letters.
  - ""FOAMS"" is a valid English word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

We now have:

- S is fixed at position 5 (✓).
- A must appear exactly once and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in COATS it was in 3 and in FOAMS it was in 4, and both were marked “-” meaning wrong position).  
  Therefore A has no legal position left → contradiction.

This means our assumption that A appears only once is wrong.  
The feedback “-” for A in both COATS and FOAMS actually confirms A is in the word but has been placed in the wrong spots each time.  
The only positions A has never been tried are 5, but 5 is already taken by S.  
Hence A must appear twice: once in the correct spot and once in an incorrect spot.  
But the game rules say the secret word is 5 letters with no restriction on repeated letters.

Re-evaluating positions:

Allowed positions for A: 5 is taken by S, so A must be in 4 (only position not banned so far).  
But in FOAMS A was in 4 and got “-”, so 4 is now banned for A.

Thus A has no legal position left if we assume it appears once.  
The only resolution is that A appears twice: one instance must be in a position we have not yet ruled out, and the other explains the “-” feedback.

Looking back:
- A has never been in position 3 or 4 in any guess.  
  Position 3 was only tried with A in COATS (3) and got “-”.  
  Position 4 was tried with A in FOAMS (4) and got “-”.  
  Therefore A must appear twice: once in position 3 and once in position 4, or some other combination.

But we have only 5 positions and S is fixed at 5.  
Possible word structure: _ _ A _ S with A appearing once, but that conflicts with feedback.  
Hence A must appear twice: e.g., A _ A _ S or A _ _ A S.

Let’s test A _ A _ S:
- Positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:A, 4:?, 5:S  
  Need two consonants not banned (R, E, L, N, C, T, F, M are banned).  
  Valid letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible word: B A A D S – but “BAADS” is not valid.  
Another: D A A D S – “DAADS” invalid.  
H: H A A D S – invalid.

Try A _ _ A S:
- Positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:A, 5:S  
  Need two consonants.  
  Example: A B O A S – “ABOAS” invalid.  
  A D O A S – “ADOAS” invalid.  
  A G O A S – “AGOAS” invalid.

Alternative: A appears once in position 2, and the “-” feedback for A in COATS and FOAMS refers to the same instance being in wrong spots.  
But position 2 has never been tested for A, so A could be in 2.

Word structure: _ A _ _ S  
Need three consonants, none banned.  
Example: B A D G S – “BADGS” invalid.  
D A B B S – invalid.

Let’s systematically list possible letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A valid word fitting constraints:
- S at 5.
- A must be in the word (from “-” feedback), and possible positions: 2 (never tested), 3 (tested and got “-”), 4 (tested and got “-”).
- To satisfy both “-” for A in COATS (A in 3) and FOAMS (A in 4), A must appear twice: once in 3 and once in 4.  
  But that would require 6 positions, impossible.

Realization: The feedback “-” for A in COATS means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
In FOAMS, “-” for A means A is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
But 5 is S, so A must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try A in position 1:
- A _ _ _ S  
  Need four consonants, none banned.  
  Example: A B O D S – “ABODS” invalid.  
  A B I D S – “ABIDS” invalid.  
  A B U D S – “ABUDS” invalid.

A in position 2:
- _ A _ _ S  
  Example: B A D G S – “BADGS” invalid.  
  D A B B S – invalid.

Another approach: use O twice.  
But O has only been marked “-” once (in COATS position 3), so O could be in 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try O in 1, A in 2, and two other consonants:
- O A _ _ S

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It uses 5 unique letters
2. All letters (A, R, O, S, E) are among the top 10 most common in English
3. It covers vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S)
4. This combination has been statistically shown to be effective in Wordle-type games

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, O, S
- Letters to exclude: R, E
- Positions to avoid for A (1), O (3), S (4).

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, S (and possibly others not yet ruled out).
2. Does not contain R or E.
3. Places A, O, S in positions they haven’t been ruled out for.

Good candidates for the remaining two letters are common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Let me try to place A, O, S in allowed spots and add two new consonants.

One strong candidate is “SALON”:
- S in position 1 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 4).
- A in position 2 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 1).
- L (new letter) in position 3.
- O in position 4 (allowed; was only ruled out of position 3).
- N (new letter) in position 5.

This covers the known letters and introduces two new common consonants.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: A R O S E  
Feedback:  A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: S A L O N  
Feedback:  S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)

Known facts:
- Letters in the word: A, O, S (each appears exactly once so far).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N.
- Position restrictions:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
  – O cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

So the three required letters must fit into the remaining five slots without violating those bans, and we need two more consonants that are not R, E, L, N.

Available positions for A: 3, 4, 5  
Available positions for O: 1, 2, 5  
Available positions for S: 2, 3, 5  

Let’s look for a valid placement:
- If A is in 3, then O and S must go in 1/2/5 and 2/5 without conflict.
  – O could be 1 or 2 or 5; S could be 2 or 5.
  – Trying O=1, S=2 → O S _ A _ → need two consonants, not R,E,L,N.
    Good consonants left: T, D, C, B, G, etc.
    One word that fits: O S _ A _ → “OSA**” – but we need a 5-letter word.
    Let’s try “OCTAS” – but that’s not a common word.
    Another option: “STO**” – but S is in 1 which is banned.
    Let’s try “COAST” – but it has two S’s, which is unlikely.
    Let’s try “COATS” – again two T’s? No, T is fine.
    Actually “COATS” uses C, O, A, T, S – all allowed letters, positions:
      C(1), O(2), A(3), T(4), S(5)
      Check bans:
        A not in 1 or 2 – ok (it’s in 3).
        O not in 3 or 4 – ok (it’s in 2).
        S not in 1 or 4 – ok (it’s in 5).
        No R, E, L, N.
      “COATS” is a valid English word.

Another candidate: “CABOS” – but B is fine, but O would be in 4 which is banned.
“SACOS” – S in 1 banned.
“SALTO” – L is banned.
“COAST” seems best.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters in the word (each appears once):
- S is in position 5 (✓).

Letters NOT in the word:
R, E, L, N, C, T.

Letters still in play (must appear once each):
A, O, S (but S is already placed at 5).

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3.
- O cannot be in positions 3, 4.
- S is fixed at position 5.

So:
- A must be in position 4 (only remaining slot it hasn't been ruled out of).
- O must fit into position 1 or 2 (since 3,4 are banned and 4 is now taken by A if any).
- We need one more consonant that hasn't been eliminated.

Letters left to pick from (excluding banned ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's construct:
- Position 1: O (possible) or another consonant.
- Position 2: If O is here, then we need a consonant for position 3.
- Position 3: Consonant.
- Position 4: A (only possible spot left for A).
- Position 5: S.

So the word structure is: _ _ _ A S or O _ _ A S.

But O cannot be in position 3 or 4, so if we put O in position 1 or 2, it works.

Let's try O in position 1: O _ _ A S.

We need a consonant for position 2 and 3 that hasn't been banned. Let's pick common ones like B, D, G, etc.

Looking for valid words:
- O B B A S – not valid.
- O B I A S – not valid.
- O G L A S – L is banned.
- O D D A S – not valid.
- O B A A S – not valid.
- O B I T S – T is banned.
- O P A S – too short.
- O B A S – too short.

Wait, we need 5 letters. Let's think differently: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- 4: A (fixed)
- 5: S (fixed)
- 1 or 2 must be O
- 3 must be a consonant
- 2 or 3 must be the other letter.

Possible structure:
- O _ _ A S
- _ O _ A S

For _ O _ A S:
- Position 1: consonant
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: consonant
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: S

Valid words:
- B O A S – too short.
- D O A S – too short.
- F O A S – too short.
- G O A S – too short.
- H O A S – not a word.
- M O A S – not a word.
- P O A S – not a word.
- V O A S – not a word.
- W O A S – not a word.

For O _ _ A S:
- O B A S – too short.
- O B I A S – not valid.
- O G A S – not valid.
- O D A S – not valid.
- O H A S – not valid.
- O P A S – not valid.
- O V A S – not valid.

Hmm, maybe we need a different consonant. Let's try G in position 3.

For _ O G A S:
- B O G A S – not a word.
- D O G A S – not a word.
- F O G A S – not a word.
- M O G A S – not a word.
- P O G A S – not a word.

Wait, maybe we need to use I or U as a vowel. Let's try:

Structure: _ _ _ A S with A at 4, S at 5, O must be in 1 or 2.

Let's try O in position 2:
- _ O _ A S

Possible words:
- B O G A S – not valid.
- D O G A S – not valid.
- F O G A S – not valid.
- H O G A S – not valid.
- M O G A S – not valid.
- P O G A S – not valid.

Wait, let's think of real 5-letter words ending in AS with A in position 4 and S in 5, and O in 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- BOARS – but R is banned.
- DOARS – not a word.
- FOAMS – M is allowed, but O is in 2, A in 4, S in 5. Let's check:
  - F, O, A, M, S – all allowed letters.
  - Positions:
    - O in 2: allowed (not banned).
    - A in 4: allowed (only banned in 1,2,3).
    - S in 5: correct.
    - No banned letters.
  - ""FOAMS"" is a valid English word.

This seems to fit all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(-) L(x) O(-) N(x)
Guess 3: COATS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) A(-) T(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: FOAMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(-) A(-) M(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now have:

- S is fixed at position 5 (✓).
- A must appear exactly once and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (because in COATS it was in 3 and in FOAMS it was in 4, and both were marked “-” meaning wrong position).  
  Therefore A has no legal position left → contradiction.

This means our assumption that A appears only once is wrong.  
The feedback “-” for A in both COATS and FOAMS actually confirms A is in the word but has been placed in the wrong spots each time.  
The only positions A has never been tried are 5, but 5 is already taken by S.  
Hence A must appear twice: once in the correct spot and once in an incorrect spot.  
But the game rules say the secret word is 5 letters with no restriction on repeated letters.

Re-evaluating positions:

Allowed positions for A: 5 is taken by S, so A must be in 4 (only position not banned so far).  
But in FOAMS A was in 4 and got “-”, so 4 is now banned for A.

Thus A has no legal position left if we assume it appears once.  
The only resolution is that A appears twice: one instance must be in a position we have not yet ruled out, and the other explains the “-” feedback.

Looking back:
- A has never been in position 3 or 4 in any guess.  
  Position 3 was only tried with A in COATS (3) and got “-”.  
  Position 4 was tried with A in FOAMS (4) and got “-”.  
  Therefore A must appear twice: once in position 3 and once in position 4, or some other combination.

But we have only 5 positions and S is fixed at 5.  
Possible word structure: _ _ A _ S with A appearing once, but that conflicts with feedback.  
Hence A must appear twice: e.g., A _ A _ S or A _ _ A S.

Let’s test A _ A _ S:
- Positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:A, 4:?, 5:S  
  Need two consonants not banned (R, E, L, N, C, T, F, M are banned).  
  Valid letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible word: B A A D S – but “BAADS” is not valid.  
Another: D A A D S – “DAADS” invalid.  
H: H A A D S – invalid.

Try A _ _ A S:
- Positions: 1:A, 2:?, 3:?, 4:A, 5:S  
  Need two consonants.  
  Example: A B O A S – “ABOAS” invalid.  
  A D O A S – “ADOAS” invalid.  
  A G O A S – “AGOAS” invalid.

Alternative: A appears once in position 2, and the “-” feedback for A in COATS and FOAMS refers to the same instance being in wrong spots.  
But position 2 has never been tested for A, so A could be in 2.

Word structure: _ A _ _ S  
Need three consonants, none banned.  
Example: B A D G S – “BADGS” invalid.  
D A B B S – invalid.

Let’s systematically list possible letters left: B, D, G, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A valid word fitting constraints:
- S at 5.
- A must be in the word (from “-” feedback), and possible positions: 2 (never tested), 3 (tested and got “-”), 4 (tested and got “-”).
- To satisfy both “-” for A in COATS (A in 3) and FOAMS (A in 4), A must appear twice: once in 3 and once in 4.  
  But that would require 6 positions, impossible.

Realization: The feedback “-” for A in COATS means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
In FOAMS, “-” for A means A is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
But 5 is S, so A must be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try A in position 1:
- A _ _ _ S  
  Need four consonants, none banned.  
  Example: A B O D S – “ABODS” invalid.  
  A B I D S – “ABIDS” invalid.  
  A B U D S – “ABUDS” invalid.

A in position 2:
- _ A _ _ S  
  Example: B A D G S – “BADGS” invalid.  
  D A B B S – invalid.

Another approach: use O twice.  
But O has only been marked “-” once (in COATS position 3), so O could be in 1, 2, 4.

Let’s try O in 1, A in 2, and two other consonants:
- O A _ _ S  
  Example: O A B D S – “OABDS” invalid.

Wait, let’s search for real 5-letter words ending in S with A and O somewhere, excluding banned letters.

Valid words:
- BOAST – T banned.
- GOATS – T banned.
- HOADS – not valid.
- MOANS – N banned.
- PAUSE – E banned.
- VOADS – not valid.

- A at 4 (never tested for A before, and not banned).
- O at 2 (never tested for O before, and not banned).
- I at 1, W at 3 – all allowed.

“IOWAS” is a valid English word (short for Iowa).

in COATS it was in 3 and in FOAMS it was in 4, and both were marked “-” meaning wrong position).  \n  Therefore A has no legal position left → contradiction.\n\nThis means our assumption that A appears only once is wrong.  \nThe feedback “-” for A in both COATS and FOAMS actually confirms A is in the word but has been placed in the wrong spots each time.  \nThe only positions A has never been tried are 5, but 5 is already taken by S.  \nHence A must appear twice: once in the correct spot and once in an incorrect spot.  \nBut the game rules say the secret word is 5 letters with no

so 4 is now banned for A.\n\nThus A has no legal position left if we assume it appears once.  \nThe only resolution is that A appears twice: one instance must be in a position we have not yet ruled out, and the other explains the “-” feedback.\n\nLooking back:\n- A has never been in position 3 or 4 in any guess.  \n  Position 3 was only tried with A in COATS (3) and got “-”.  \n  Position 4 was tried with A in FOAMS (4) and got “-”.  \n  Therefore A must appear twice: once in position 3 and once in position 4, or some other combination.\n\nBut we have only 5 positions and S is fixed at 5.  \nPossible word structure: _ _ A _ S with A appearing once, but that conflicts with feedback.  \nHence A must appear twice: e.g., A _ A _ S or A _ _ A S.\n\nLet’s test A _ A _ S:\n- Positions: 1:A,

and once in 4.  \n  But that would require 6 positions, impossible.\n\nRealization: The feedback “-” for A in COATS means A is in the word but not in position 3.  \nIn FOAMS, “-” for A means A is in the word but not in position 4.  \nThus A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  \nBut 5 is S, so A must be in 1 or 2.\n\nLet’s try A in position 1:\n- A _ _ _ S  \n  Need four consonants, none banned.  \n

From the new feedback on IOWAS:
- I is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- W is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 4.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – position 5.

So we now know:
- Word ends with “AS” (positions 4-5: A✓, S✓).
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters not in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T, F, M, I, W.
- Letters still allowed: A (already placed), O, S (already placed), and any remaining consonants not banned (B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, Y, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word ending in “AS” with O somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is S, so positions 1 or 3).

Possible structures:
- O _ _ A S (O in 1)
- _ _ O A S (O in 3)

Let’s list valid English words ending in “AS” with O in 1 or 3, and no banned letters.

1. O _ _ A S:
   - O B A S – too short.
   - O B O A S – “OBOAS” invalid.
   - O G O A S – “OGOAS” invalid.
   - O B B A S – “OBBAS” invalid.
   - O B D A S – “OBDAS” invalid.

2. _ _ O A S:
   - B O A S – too short.
   - D O A S – too short.
   - G O A S – too short.
   - H O A S – “HOAS” invalid.
   - B O D A S – “BODAS” invalid.
   - D O B A S – “DOBAS” invalid.
   - G O B A S – “GOBAS” invalid.
   - H O D A S – “HODAS” invalid.
   - P O B A S – “POBAS” invalid.
   - U N O A S – N banned.
   - V O B A S – “VOBAS” invalid.
   - Y O B A S – “YOBAS” invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: use remaining consonants for positions 1-3.

Valid letters left: B, D, G, H, K, P, U, V, Y, O.

We need:
- Position 1: consonant or O.
- Position 2: consonant or O (but O cannot be in 2, so consonant).
- Position 3: consonant or O (O can be here).
- Position 4: A (fixed).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

So possible structures:
- C O N O A S – but that’s 6 letters.
- C O N A S – 5 letters: positions 1-3 and 2 must be consonants, with O in 1 or 3.

Let’s look for 5-letter words ending in “AS” with O in 1 or 3.

Valid words:
- BOGAS – not valid.
- DONGAS – too long.
- HONGAS – too long.
- PONGAS – too long.
- VOGAS – not valid.
- YOGAS – valid 5-letter word: Y, O, G, A, S.

Check constraints:
- Y: allowed (never banned).
- O: allowed (must be in 1 or 3, here in 2 – but O cannot be in 2).  
  So “YOGAS” is invalid because O would be in position 2.
