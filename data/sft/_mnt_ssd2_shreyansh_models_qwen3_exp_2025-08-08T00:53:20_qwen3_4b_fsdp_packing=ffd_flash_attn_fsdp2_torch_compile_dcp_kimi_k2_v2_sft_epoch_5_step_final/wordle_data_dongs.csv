### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate many possibilities early.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, N, R). This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter N, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes N somewhere other than position 4.
2. Excludes C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Let’s pick a word that uses N plus other common letters. A good candidate is “STONE” but E is excluded. “BLOND” uses N in position 4 which is disallowed. “POINT” uses N in position 3 and includes P, O, I, T. This seems good.

Another candidate: “DINOS” (but S is allowed, N in position 2). However, “POINT” seems more balanced.

I’ll go with POINT:
- P: new letter
- O: new vowel
- I: new vowel
- N: must be in word, not in position 4 (here it’s position 3 – OK)
- T: new letter

This gives us coverage of P, O, I, T, N.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: N and O  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (it appeared in positions 3 and 4 in previous guesses and was marked “-” both times).  
   – O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  

So the secret word has the form:
_ O _ _ _

and must contain at least one N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: U (A, E, I already ruled out; O is fixed in position 2).

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2.  
- Place N in a new position (1, 3, or 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- BOUND (B, U, N in 3, D) – but N is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.  
- GONNU – not a valid word.  
- FOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- HONDA – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- MOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SONGY – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  

We need N in position 1, 3, or 5, but positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so possible positions for N are 1 or 5.

Let’s try:
- N O _ _ _ (N in position 1)  
  Example: NUDGE (U, D, G, E) – but E is excluded.  
  Example: NODDY – D, D, Y – but double D and Y may not be optimal.  
  Example: NUDGE – E excluded.  
  Example: NUGGY – G, G, Y – possible.  

- _ O _ _ N (N in position 5)  
  Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
  Example: S O U L N – not a word.  
  Example: B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: S O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  

Looking for valid words with N in position 1 or 5:

Valid words:
- NUDGE (but E excluded)  
- NODDY  
- NUGGY  
- NOLAN (but A excluded)  
- NORMA (A excluded)  
- NUTSY  
- NOVEM (not common)  

Best options seem NODDY, NUGGY, or NUTSY.  

NODDY: uses D, D, Y – introduces two D’s, which may not be optimal.  
NUGGY: uses U, G, G, Y – introduces U and G.  
NUTSY: uses U, T, S, Y – but T is excluded.  

Thus, NUGGY is the best among these. However, NUGGY has N in position 1 (OK), O in 2 (fixed), U in 3, G in 4, G in 5.  

But we already know T is excluded, and NUGGY doesn’t use T.  

Another candidate: HONEY – but E excluded.  
BOUGH – N not present.  

Wait, we need to include N.  

Another valid word:  
- M O U N T – T excluded.  
- S O U N T – T excluded.  

We need N in position 1 or 5.  

Let me think differently: we have _ O _ _ _ and must include N. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5. But positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so N must be in position 1 or 5.  

Valid words with N in position 1:  
NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY, NOLAN (A excluded), NORMA (A excluded).  

Valid words with N in position 5:  
Looking for _ O _ _ N.  
Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
S O U L N – not a word.  
B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  

So the only valid words seem to be NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY.  

NUGGY:  
Letters: N, O, U, G, G.  
- N in position 1 (OK).  
- O in position 2 (fixed).  
- U, G, G are new letters.  

This seems the best choice to test U and G.  

Therefore, next guess: NUGGY.

Letters: N, O, U, G, G.  
- N in position 1 (OK).  
- O in position 2 (fixed).  
- U, G, G are new letters.  

This seems the best choice to test U and G.  

Therefore, next guess: NUGGY.",Guess 3: NUGGY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) U(x) G(-) G(✓) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate many possibilities early.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, N, R). This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter N, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes N somewhere other than position 4.
2. Excludes C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Let’s pick a word that uses N plus other common letters. A good candidate is “STONE” but E is excluded. “BLOND” uses N in position 4 which is disallowed. “POINT” uses N in position 3 and includes P, O, I, T. This seems good.

Another candidate: “DINOS” (but S is allowed, N in position 2). However, “POINT” seems more balanced.

I’ll go with POINT:
- P: new letter
- O: new vowel
- I: new vowel
- N: must be in word, not in position 4 (here it’s position 3 – OK)
- T: new letter

This gives us coverage of P, O, I, T, N.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: N and O  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (it appeared in positions 3 and 4 in previous guesses and was marked “-” both times).  
   – O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  

So the secret word has the form:
_ O _ _ _

and must contain at least one N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: U (A, E, I already ruled out; O is fixed in position 2).

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2.  
- Place N in a new position (1, 3, or 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- BOUND (B, U, N in 3, D) – but N is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.  
- GONNU – not a valid word.  
- FOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- HONDA – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- MOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SONGY – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  

We need N in position 1, 3, or 5, but positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so possible positions for N are 1 or 5.

Let’s try:
- N O _ _ _ (N in position 1)  
  Example: NUDGE (U, D, G, E) – but E is excluded.  
  Example: NODDY – D, D, Y – but double D and Y may not be optimal.  
  Example: NUDGE – E excluded.  
  Example: NUGGY – G, G, Y – possible.  

- _ O _ _ N (N in position 5)  
  Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
  Example: S O U L N – not a word.  
  Example: B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: S O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  

Looking for valid words with N in position 1 or 5:

Valid words:
- NUDGE (but E excluded)  
- NODDY  
- NUGGY  
- NOLAN (but A excluded)  
- NORMA (A excluded)  
- NUTSY  
- NOVEM (not common)  

Best options seem NODDY, NUGGY, or NUTSY.  

NODDY: uses D, D, Y – introduces two D’s, which may not be optimal.  
NUGGY: uses U, G, G, Y – introduces U and G.  
NUTSY: uses U, T, S, Y – but T is excluded.  

Thus, NUGGY is the best among these. However, NUGGY has N in position 1 (OK), O in 2 (fixed), U in 3, G in 4, G in 5.  

But we already know T is excluded, and NUGGY doesn’t use T.  

Another candidate: HONEY – but E excluded.  
BOUGH – N not present.  

Wait, we need to include N.  

Another valid word:  
- M O U N T – T excluded.  
- S O U N T – T excluded.  

We need N in position 1 or 5.  

Let me think differently: we have _ O _ _ _ and must include N. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5. But positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so N must be in position 1 or 5.  

Valid words with N in position 1:  
NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY, NOLAN (A excluded), NORMA (A excluded).  

Valid words with N in position 5:  
Looking for _ O _ _ N.  
Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
S O U L N – not a word.  
B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  

So the only valid words seem to be NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY.  

NUGGY:  
Letters: N, O, U, G, G.  
- N in position 1 (OK).  
- O in position 2 (fixed).  
- U, G, G are new letters.  

This seems the best choice to test U and G.  

Therefore, next guess: NUGGY.

Let's extract the new information from the third guess NUGGY:

- N(-): N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U(x): U is NOT in the word.  
- G(-): G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- G(✓): G is in the word AND in position 4.  
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word.

So we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), G (position 4), N (somewhere), and we still need two more letters.

The secret word looks like: _ O _ G _

N must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 have been ruled out for N in previous guesses, but we only know it's not in 1 or 3 from earlier feedback? Wait, let's re-examine N positions:

From CRANE: N was in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N was in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N was in position 1 (-)  

So N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5.

Thus the word has the form: _ O _ G N

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that are NOT in the excluded list: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y are excluded. Remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in ""OGN"":
- B: BOGON (not common)
- D: DOGON (valid, a people group)
- F: FOGON (not common)
- H: HOGON (not common)
- K: KOGON (not common)
- L: LOGON (but LOGON is 5 letters, but N is already at 5)
- M: MOGON (not common)
- S: SONG (but needs 5 letters)
- V: VOGON (not common)
- W: WOGON (not common)

Actually, looking at _ O _ G N, the only common word seems to be ""DOGON"" (a people group in Africa). However, ""DOGON"" is valid.

But let's check: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

Looking at possible third letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W.

Possible words:
- D O B G N – not valid
- D O F G N – not valid
- D O H G N – not valid
- D O K G N – not valid
- D O L G N – not valid
- D O M G N – not valid
- D O S G N – not valid
- D O V G N – not valid
- D O W G N – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe ""DOGON"" is the only one, but it's a proper noun. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""HONDA"" but A is excluded. 

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ G N. The only common English word I can think of is ""HONG"" but that's 4 letters. 

This suggests ""DOGON"" might be the intended word despite being a proper noun. 

But let's check another angle: maybe N is in position 2, but position 2 is O, so that's impossible. 

Thus, N must be in position 5, making the word _ O _ G N. The only valid word seems to be ""DOGON"".

However, ""DOGON"" has O in position 3, which is allowed. 

But let's verify: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 must be G, so it's D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

The only valid word I can find is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but that has O in position 3 and 4, which is fine since we only know O is in position 2. 

But wait, position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant. 

Looking at valid English words: ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which fits _ O _ G N if we consider position 3 as O, but O is already in position 2. 

Actually, ""DOGON"" is D-O-G-O-N, which would be positions:
1: D
2: O
3: G
4: O
5: N

But we know position 4 must be G, not O. So this doesn't fit. 

I think I made a mistake. The word must be _ O _ G N, with G in position 4. 

Valid English words with G in position 4 and N in position 5:
- B O X G N – not valid
- D O M E N – but E is excluded
- F O G G N – not valid
- H O G G N – not valid
- L O G G N – not valid
- M O G G N – not valid
- S O G G N – not valid
- V O G G N – not valid

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. 

Wait, ""HONG"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""HONG"" but it's 4 letters. 

This suggests the word must be ""DOGON"" despite the O in position 3, but position 4 must be G. 

I think the correct word is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but this has O in position 3 and 4, but position 4 must be G. 

I realize now that ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which doesn't fit _ O _ G N because position 4 is O, not G. 

This indicates I need to reconsider. 

Let me list possible _ O _ G N words:
- B O _ G N: B O G G N (not valid)
- D O _ G N: D O G G N (not valid)
- F O _ G N: F O G G N (not valid)
- H O _ G N: H O G G N (not valid)
- L O _ G N: L O G G N (not valid)
- M O _ G N: M O G G N (not valid)
- S O _ G N: S O G G N (not valid)
- V O _ G N: V O G G N (not valid)

None of these are valid. This suggests an error in my earlier deduction. 

Re-examining N positions:
From CRANE: N in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N in position 1 (-)  

Thus N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. Position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5. 

Thus the word is _ O _ G N. 

Looking up valid English words ending in ""OGN"":
- B O G O N – not valid
- D O G O N – ""DOGON"" (valid proper noun)
- F O G O N – not valid
- H O G O N – not valid
- L O G O N – not valid
- M O G O N – not valid
- S O G O N – not valid
- V O G O N – not valid

The only valid word is ""DOGON"", even though it's a proper noun. 

Thus, the next guess is DOGON.
</think>

Based on all feedback so far:
- O is locked in position 2.
- G is locked in position 4.
- N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting _ O _ G N is:

<guess>DOGON</guess>",DOGON,"Let's extract the new information from the third guess NUGGY:

- N(-): N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U(x): U is NOT in the word.  
- G(-): G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- G(✓): G is in the word AND in position 4.  
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word.

So we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), G (position 4), N (somewhere), and we still need two more letters.

The secret word looks like: _ O _ G _

N must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 have been ruled out for N in previous guesses, but we only know it's not in 1 or 3 from earlier feedback? Wait, let's re-examine N positions:

From CRANE: N was in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N was in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N was in position 1 (-)  

So N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5.

Thus the word has the form: _ O _ G N

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that are NOT in the excluded list: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y are excluded. Remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.

Actually, looking at _ O _ G N, the only common word seems to be ""DOGON"" (a people group in Africa). However, ""DOGON"" is valid.

But let's check: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

Looking at possible third letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W.

Possible words:
- D O B G N – not valid
- D O F G N – not valid
- D O H G N – not valid
- D O K G N – not valid
- D O L G N – not valid
- D O M G N – not valid
- D O S G N – not valid
- D O V G N – not valid
- D O W G N – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe ""DOGON"" is the only one, but it's a proper noun. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""HONDA"" but A is excluded. 

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ G N. The only common English word I can think of is ""HONG"" but that's 4 letters. 

This suggests ""DOGON"" might be the intended word despite being a proper noun. 

But let's check another angle: maybe N is in position 2, but position 2 is O, so that's impossible. 

Thus, N must be in position 5, making the word _ O _ G N. The only valid word seems to be ""DOGON"".

However, ""DOGON"" has O in position 3, which is allowed. 

But let's verify: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 must be G, so it's D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

The only valid word I can find is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but that has O in position 3 and 4, which is fine since we only know O is in position 2. 

But wait, position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant. 

Looking at valid English words: ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which fits _ O _ G N if we consider position 3 as O, but O is already in position 2. 

Actually, ""DOGON"" is D-O-G-O-N, which would be positions:
1: D
2: O
3: G
4: O
5: N

But we know position 4 must be G, not O. So this doesn't fit. 

I think I made a mistake. The word must be _ O _ G N, with G in position 4. 

Valid English words with G in position 4 and N in position 5:
- B O X G N – not valid
- D O M E N – but E is excluded
- F O G G N – not valid
- H O G G N – not valid
- L O G G N – not valid
- M O G G N – not valid
- S O G G N – not valid
- V O G G N – not valid

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. 

Wait, ""HONG"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""HONG"" but it's 4 letters. 

This suggests the word must be ""DOGON"" despite the O in position 3, but position 4 must be G. 

I think the correct word is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but this has O in position 3 and 4, but position 4 must be G. 

I realize now that ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which doesn't fit _ O _ G N because position 4 is O, not G. 

This indicates I need to reconsider. 

Let me list possible _ O _ G N words:
- B O _ G N: B O G G N (not valid)
- D O _ G N: D O G G N (not valid)
- F O _ G N: F O G G N (not valid)
- H O _ G N: H O G G N (not valid)
- L O _ G N: L O G G N (not valid)
- M O _ G N: M O G G N (not valid)
- S O _ G N: S O G G N (not valid)
- V O _ G N: V O G G N (not valid)

None of these are valid. This suggests an error in my earlier deduction. 

Re-examining N positions:
From CRANE: N in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N in position 1 (-)  

Thus N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. Position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5. 

Thus the word is _ O _ G N. 

Looking up valid English words ending in ""OGN"":
- B O G O N – not valid
- D O G O N – ""DOGON"" (valid proper noun)
- F O G O N – not valid
- H O G O N – not valid
- L O G O N – not valid
- M O G O N – not valid
- S O G O N – not valid
- V O G O N – not valid

The only valid word is ""DOGON"", even though it's a proper noun. 

Thus, the next guess is DOGON.Based on all feedback so far:
- O is locked in position 2.
- G is locked in position 4.
- N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate many possibilities early.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (C, N, R). This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- N: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter N, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes N somewhere other than position 4.
2. Excludes C, R, A, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, B, G, H, M, P, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Let’s pick a word that uses N plus other common letters. A good candidate is “STONE” but E is excluded. “BLOND” uses N in position 4 which is disallowed. “POINT” uses N in position 3 and includes P, O, I, T. This seems good.

Another candidate: “DINOS” (but S is allowed, N in position 2). However, “POINT” seems more balanced.

I’ll go with POINT:
- P: new letter
- O: new vowel
- I: new vowel
- N: must be in word, not in position 4 (here it’s position 3 – OK)
- T: new letter

This gives us coverage of P, O, I, T, N.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: N and O  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (it appeared in positions 3 and 4 in previous guesses and was marked “-” both times).  
   – O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).  

So the secret word has the form:
_ O _ _ _

and must contain at least one N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: U (A, E, I already ruled out; O is fixed in position 2).

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2.  
- Place N in a new position (1, 3, or 5).  
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- BOUND (B, U, N in 3, D) – but N is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong.  
- GONNU – not a valid word.  
- FOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- HONDA – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- MOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SONGY – N in 3 again (invalid).  
- SOUND – N in 3 again (invalid).  

We need N in position 1, 3, or 5, but positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so possible positions for N are 1 or 5.

Let’s try:
- N O _ _ _ (N in position 1)  
  Example: NUDGE (U, D, G, E) – but E is excluded.  
  Example: NODDY – D, D, Y – but double D and Y may not be optimal.  
  Example: NUDGE – E excluded.  
  Example: NUGGY – G, G, Y – possible.  

- _ O _ _ N (N in position 5)  
  Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
  Example: S O U L N – not a word.  
  Example: B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  
  Example: S O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  

Looking for valid words with N in position 1 or 5:

Valid words:
- NUDGE (but E excluded)  
- NODDY  
- NUGGY  
- NOLAN (but A excluded)  
- NORMA (A excluded)  
- NUTSY  
- NOVEM (not common)  

Best options seem NODDY, NUGGY, or NUTSY.  

NODDY: uses D, D, Y – introduces two D’s, which may not be optimal.  
NUGGY: uses U, G, G, Y – introduces U and G.  
NUTSY: uses U, T, S, Y – but T is excluded.  

Thus, NUGGY is the best among these. However, NUGGY has N in position 1 (OK), O in 2 (fixed), U in 3, G in 4, G in 5.  

But we already know T is excluded, and NUGGY doesn’t use T.  

Another candidate: HONEY – but E excluded.  
BOUGH – N not present.  

Wait, we need to include N.  

Another valid word:  
- M O U N T – T excluded.  
- S O U N T – T excluded.  

We need N in position 1 or 5.  

Let me think differently: we have _ O _ _ _ and must include N. Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 5. But positions 3 and 4 are already ruled out for N, so N must be in position 1 or 5.  

Valid words with N in position 1:  
NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY, NOLAN (A excluded), NORMA (A excluded).  

Valid words with N in position 5:  
Looking for _ O _ _ N.  
Example: M O U S N – not a word.  
S O U L N – not a word.  
B O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
F O U N D – N in 4 (invalid).  
L O U N G – N in 4 (invalid).  

So the only valid words seem to be NODDY, NUGGY, NUDGE, NUTSY.  

NUGGY:  
Letters: N, O, U, G, G.  
- N in position 1 (OK).  
- O in position 2 (fixed).  
- U, G, G are new letters.  

This seems the best choice to test U and G.  

Therefore, next guess: NUGGY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)
Guess 3: NUGGY -> FEEDBACK: N(-) U(x) G(-) G(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's extract the new information from the third guess NUGGY:

- N(-): N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- U(x): U is NOT in the word.  
- G(-): G is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- G(✓): G is in the word AND in position 4.  
- Y(x): Y is NOT in the word.

So we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: O (position 2), G (position 4), N (somewhere), and we still need two more letters.

The secret word looks like: _ O _ G _

N must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 have been ruled out for N in previous guesses, but we only know it's not in 1 or 3 from earlier feedback? Wait, let's re-examine N positions:

From CRANE: N was in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N was in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N was in position 1 (-)  

So N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5.

Thus the word has the form: _ O _ G N

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that are NOT in the excluded list: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y are excluded. Remaining common letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in ""OGN"":
- B: BOGON (not common)
- D: DOGON (valid, a people group)
- F: FOGON (not common)
- H: HOGON (not common)
- K: KOGON (not common)
- L: LOGON (but LOGON is 5 letters, but N is already at 5)
- M: MOGON (not common)
- S: SONG (but needs 5 letters)
- V: VOGON (not common)
- W: WOGON (not common)

Actually, looking at _ O _ G N, the only common word seems to be ""DOGON"" (a people group in Africa). However, ""DOGON"" is valid.

But let's check: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

Looking at possible third letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W.

Possible words:
- D O B G N – not valid
- D O F G N – not valid
- D O H G N – not valid
- D O K G N – not valid
- D O L G N – not valid
- D O M G N – not valid
- D O S G N – not valid
- D O V G N – not valid
- D O W G N – not valid

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe ""DOGON"" is the only one, but it's a proper noun. 

Alternatively, maybe the word is ""HONDA"" but A is excluded. 

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ O _ G N. The only common English word I can think of is ""HONG"" but that's 4 letters. 

This suggests ""DOGON"" might be the intended word despite being a proper noun. 

But let's check another angle: maybe N is in position 2, but position 2 is O, so that's impossible. 

Thus, N must be in position 5, making the word _ O _ G N. The only valid word seems to be ""DOGON"".

However, ""DOGON"" has O in position 3, which is allowed. 

But let's verify: D, O, G, O, N – but position 4 must be G, so it's D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant not in the excluded list. 

The only valid word I can find is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but that has O in position 3 and 4, which is fine since we only know O is in position 2. 

But wait, position 4 is G, so it would be D O _ G N. The third letter must be a consonant. 

Looking at valid English words: ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which fits _ O _ G N if we consider position 3 as O, but O is already in position 2. 

Actually, ""DOGON"" is D-O-G-O-N, which would be positions:
1: D
2: O
3: G
4: O
5: N

But we know position 4 must be G, not O. So this doesn't fit. 

I think I made a mistake. The word must be _ O _ G N, with G in position 4. 

Valid English words with G in position 4 and N in position 5:
- B O X G N – not valid
- D O M E N – but E is excluded
- F O G G N – not valid
- H O G G N – not valid
- L O G G N – not valid
- M O G G N – not valid
- S O G G N – not valid
- V O G G N – not valid

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed a word. 

Wait, ""HONG"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, the only valid word I can think of is ""HONG"" but it's 4 letters. 

This suggests the word must be ""DOGON"" despite the O in position 3, but position 4 must be G. 

I think the correct word is ""DOGON"" (D-O-G-O-N), but this has O in position 3 and 4, but position 4 must be G. 

I realize now that ""DOGON"" is actually D-O-G-O-N, which doesn't fit _ O _ G N because position 4 is O, not G. 

This indicates I need to reconsider. 

Let me list possible _ O _ G N words:
- B O _ G N: B O G G N (not valid)
- D O _ G N: D O G G N (not valid)
- F O _ G N: F O G G N (not valid)
- H O _ G N: H O G G N (not valid)
- L O _ G N: L O G G N (not valid)
- M O _ G N: M O G G N (not valid)
- S O _ G N: S O G G N (not valid)
- V O _ G N: V O G G N (not valid)

None of these are valid. This suggests an error in my earlier deduction. 

Re-examining N positions:
From CRANE: N in position 4 (-)  
From POINT: N in position 3 (-)  
From NUGGY: N in position 1 (-)  

Thus N is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, N must be in position 2 or 5. Position 2 is O, so N must be in position 5. 

Thus the word is _ O _ G N. 

Looking up valid English words ending in ""OGN"":
- B O G O N – not valid
- D O G O N – ""DOGON"" (valid proper noun)
- F O G O N – not valid
- H O G O N – not valid
- L O G O N – not valid
- M O G O N – not valid
- S O G O N – not valid
- V O G O N – not valid

The only valid word is ""DOGON"", even though it's a proper noun. 

Thus, the next guess is DOGON.Based on all feedback so far:
- O is locked in position 2.
- G is locked in position 4.
- N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1, 3, or 4).

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

1. Position 2 = O (locked).
2. Position 4 = G (locked).
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked ""-"" in all four positions across the four guesses).  
   That leaves only position 2 for N, but position 2 is already O.  
   This contradiction means my earlier deduction was wrong.

Re-examining N placement:
- CRANE: N in position 4 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)
- POINT: N in position 3 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)
- NUGGY: N in position 1 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)
- DOGON: N in position 5 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)

Thus N is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining position is position 2, but position 2 is O.  
This implies no valid placement for N, which is impossible—there must be an error.

Ah! I misread DOGON's feedback. The word DOGON has N in position 5, and the feedback for that position was ""-"" (N is not there).  
Therefore N is not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. There are no remaining positions for N. This can't be right.

Rechecking:
- CRANE: N in 4 → ""-""  
- POINT: N in 3 → ""-""  
- NUGGY: N in 1 → ""-""  
- DOGON: N in 5 → ""-""  

This means N is not in any position 1-5, which contradicts the fact that N must be in the word.  
The only resolution is that N must be in position 2, but position 2 is O.  

This indicates the word must be O O _ G N, but that's impossible since letters can't repeat unless allowed.  

Looking back at the feedback rules, letters can repeat in guesses but the secret word may or may not.  

However, the feedback symbols apply to the letter in the guess, not the secret word.  
Thus, in DOGON, the first D got ""✓"", so D is correct in position 1.  
O in position 2 got ""✓"", so O is correct in position 2.  
G in position 3 got ""-"", so G exists but not in position 3.  
O in position 4 got ""-"", so O exists but not in position 4.  
N in position 5 got ""-"", so N exists but not in position 5.  

So we now have:
- Position 1 = D (✓)
- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = G (✓ from DOGON's position 4 feedback, but DOGON's position 4 was O, not G. Wait, let's re-express DOGON feedback carefully.)

Correct breakdown of DOGON feedback:
D(✓) → D is correct in position 1.
O(✓) → O is correct in position 2.
G(-) → G exists but not in position 3.
O(-) → O exists but not in position 4.
N(-) → N exists but not in position 5.

Thus:
- Position 1 = D
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = ? (not O, and from earlier we have G in position 4 from NUGGY feedback: G(✓) in position 4 of NUGGY, but NUGGY's position 4 was G, and feedback was G(✓), so G is correct in position 4.)
Wait, let's re-express all feedback carefully:

Guess 1: CRANE
C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
→ N exists but not in position 4.

Guess 2: POINT
P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)  
→ O is correct in position 2, N exists but not in position 3.

Guess 3: NUGGY
N(-) U(x) G(-) G(✓) Y(x)  
→ N exists but not in position 1, G exists but not in position 3, G is correct in position 4, U and Y not in word.

Guess 4: DOGON
D(✓) O(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)  
→ D is correct in position 1, O is correct in position 2, G exists but not in position 3, O exists but not in position 4, N exists but not in position 5.

Consolidated facts:
- Word structure: D O _ G _
- Letters known to exist: D (1), O (2), G (4), N (somewhere)
- N cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible position is 2, but position 2 is O.  
  This contradiction indicates an error in interpretation.

Re-examining NUGGY feedback:
NUGGY: N(-) U(x) G(-) G(✓) Y(x)
- G(✓) in position 4 of NUGGY means G is correct in position 4 of the secret word.  
- G(-) in position 3 of NUGGY means G exists but not in position 3.  
- N(-) in position 1 of NUGGY means N exists but not in position 1.  

DOGON feedback:
D(✓) O(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)
- D(✓) position 1
- O(✓) position 2
- G(-) position 3 → G exists but not in position 3 (consistent with NUGGY)
- O(-) position 4 → O exists but not in position 4 (but we know O is in position 2, so this is fine)
- N(-) position 5 → N exists but not in position 5

Thus:
- Word structure: D O _ G _
- N must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 1, 4, 5 and positions 1,2,4,5 are partially filled)
- Position 3 must be N

Thus the word is D O N G _

Now we need a fifth letter. Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, E, P, I, T, U, Y, and we have D, O, N, G already.  
Possible remaining letters: B, F, H, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words starting with DONG:
- DONGS (valid, plural of dong)
- DONGA (but A excluded)
- DONGS is the only common word.

Thus the next guess is DONGS.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback:
- D is correct in position 1
- O is correct in position 2
- G is correct in position 4
- N must be in position 3 (only remaining spot)
- The fifth letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out

The resulting word is DONGS.

   That leaves only position 2 for N, but position 2 is already O.

Re-examining N placement:

- NUGGY: N in position 1 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)
- DOGON: N in position 5 → ""-"" (N exists but not there)

Thus N is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
The only remaining position is position 2, but position 2 is O.  
This implies no valid placement for N, which is impossible—there must be an error.

Ah! I misread DOGON's feedback. The word DOGON has N in position 5, and the feedback for that position was ""-"" (N is not there).  
Therefore N is not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. There are no remaining positions for N. This can't be right.

Rechecking:
- CRANE: N in 4 → ""-""  
- POINT: N in 3 → ""-""  
- NUGGY: N in 1 → ""-""  
- DOGON: N in 5 → ""-""  

This means N is not in any position 1-5, which contradicts the fact that N must be in the word.  
The only resolution is that N must be in position 2, but position 2 is O.  

This indicates the word must be O O _ G N, but that's impossible since letters can't repeat unless allowed.  

Looking back at the feedback rules, letters can repeat in guesses but the secret word may or may not.  

However, the feedback symbols apply to the letter in the guess, not the secret word.  
Thus, in DOGON, the first D got ""✓"", so D is correct in position 1.  
O in position 2 got ""✓"", so O is correct in position 2.  
G in position 3 got ""-"", so G exists but not in position 3.  
O in position 4 got ""-"", so O exists but not in position 4.  
N in position 5 got ""-"", so N exists but not in position 5.  

So we now have:
- Position 1 = D (✓)
- Position 2 = O (✓)
- Position 4 = G (✓ from DOGON's position 4 feedback, but DOGON's position 4 was O, not G. Wait, let's re-express DOGON feedback carefully.)

Correct breakdown of DOGON feedback:
D(✓) → D is correct in position 1.
O(✓) → O is correct in position 2.
G(-) → G exists but not in position 3.
O(-) → O exists but not in position 4.
N(-) → N exists but not in position 5.

Thus:
- Position 1 = D
- Position 2 = O
- Position 4 = ? (not O, and from earlier we have G in position 4 from NUGGY feedback: G(✓) in position 4 of NUGGY, but NUGGY's position 4 was G, and feedback was G(✓), so G is correct in position 4.)

Guess 3: NUGGY

Consolidated facts:

- Letters known to exist: D (1), O (2), G (4), N (somewhere)
- N cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 → only possible position is 2, but position 2 is O.  
  This contradiction indicates an error in interpretation.

Re-examining NUGGY feedback:
NUGGY: N(-) U(x) G(-) G(✓) Y(x)
- G(✓) in position 4 of NUGGY means G is correct in position 4 of the secret word.  
- G(-) in position 3 of NUGGY means G exists but not in position 3.  
- N(-) in position 1 of NUGGY means N exists but not in position 1.  

DOGON feedback:
D(✓) O(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)
- D(✓) position 1

Thus:

- Position 3 must be N

Thus the word is D O N G _
