### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters that are in the word: A, S
- Positions to test for A: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Positions to test for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, E
3. Places A and S in new positions to gather more info

Good candidates use other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, U). A strong second guess is ""SAINT"":
- S in position 1 (testing new spot)
- A in position 2 (testing new spot)
- I, N, T are common letters we haven't tested yet

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: saint → S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters confirmed in the word: A (now known to be in position 2) and S.
2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T.
3. S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (from arose) and not in position 1 again (from saint), so S must be in position 3 or 5.
4. A is in position 2 (fixed).

So far the word looks like: _ A S _ _  or  _ A _ S _  (but S can't be in position 4 anyway).

Remaining common letters we haven't tried yet: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has S in position 3 or 5
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (no R, O, E, I, N, T)

Let's try ""CASHY"":
- C: new letter
- A: in position 2 (matches ✓)
- S: in position 3 (new position)
- H: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 3 and introduces three new letters.

From the latest feedback:

Guess 4: gaugs → G(x) A(✓) U(x) G(x) S(✓)

Key deductions:
- A is fixed in slot 2 (already known).
- S is now confirmed in slot 5.
- G and U are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ _ S

Excluded letters so far: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, H, Y, G, U.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W.
Remaining vowels: none (A is used, E, I, O, U are excluded).

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- A in slot 2
- S in slot 5
- Only letters from the allowed set (B, D, F, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.)

Possible words:
- B A D K S → ""badks"" – invalid
- B A L K S → ""balks"" – valid (but ""balks"" is archaic)
- D A M P S → invalid
- F A K E S → E excluded

- M A N G S → N and G excluded
- P A P A S → P allowed, but pattern is _ A _ _ S
- B A L K S → ""balks"" is the only valid one fitting _ A _ _ S.

""Balks"" is the only valid word left in this pattern, despite being archaic. The other possibilities either use excluded letters or aren't words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. The best strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters and should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is not in the word at all
- S is in the word but not in position 4
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E
- Letters that are in the word: A, S
- Positions to test for A: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Positions to test for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A and S
2. Does not contain R, O, E
3. Places A and S in new positions to gather more info

Good candidates use other common consonants (T, N, L, C, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, U). A strong second guess is ""SAINT"":
- S in position 1 (testing new spot)
- A in position 2 (testing new spot)
- I, N, T are common letters we haven't tested yet

Guess 2: saint -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: saint → S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)

Key deductions:
1. Letters confirmed in the word: A (now known to be in position 2) and S.
2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, T.
3. S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (from arose) and not in position 1 again (from saint), so S must be in position 3 or 5.
4. A is in position 2 (fixed).

So far the word looks like: _ A S _ _  or  _ A _ S _  (but S can't be in position 4 anyway).

Remaining common letters we haven't tried yet: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has S in position 3 or 5
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (no R, O, E, I, N, T)

Let's try ""CASHY"":
- C: new letter
- A: in position 2 (matches ✓)
- S: in position 3 (new position)
- H: new letter
- Y: new letter

This tests S in position 3 and introduces three new letters.

From the three guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A exists but not in slot 1  
   – R, O, E do not appear  
   – S exists but not in slot 4

   – A is fixed in slot 2  
   – S exists but not in slot 1  
   – I, N, T do not appear  

3. cashy → C(x) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(x)  
   – A confirmed in slot 2  
   – S exists but not in slot 3  
   – C, H, Y do not appear  

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
- S must be in slot 5 (cannot be 1, 3, 4)  
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, H, Y  
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  
- Remaining vowels: U (since A is already placed)  

We need a word that:
- Has A in slot 2  
- Has S in slot 5  
- Uses only letters not yet excluded  

Candidate: B A D S U → but ""badus"" isn’t a valid English word.  
Next: B A L S U → ""balus"" isn’t valid.  
Next: B A G S U → ""bagsu"" isn’t valid.  
Next: D A M S U → ""damsu"" isn’t valid.  
Next: L A M S U → ""lamsu"" isn’t valid.  

Try swapping vowels: we only have A and U left (since E, I, O are out).  
Try consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.  

A valid word fitting the pattern: B A S I C → but I and C are excluded.  
Another: B A D S Y → Y excluded.  
Another: D A M P S → but S must be last.  

Wait, we need _ A _ _ S.  
Valid word: B A L K S → ""balks"" – but K is allowed, L is allowed, B is allowed.  
Check excluded letters: B, A, L, K, S – none are excluded.  

""balks"" is a valid 5-letter English word meaning ""balks"" (archaic for ""hesitates""), though rare.  

Another valid word: F A U C S → but C is excluded.  
Another: G A U G S → but G is repeated and not ideal.  
Another: L A U G H → but H is excluded.  

Best valid candidate: B A L K S – ""balks"".  

But ""balks"" is obscure. Next: P A U S E → E excluded.  
Next: F A U S E → E excluded.  
Next: M A U S E → E excluded.  

Next: B A U S S → invalid.  

Next: D A U G S → ""daugs"" – not a word.  

Next: G A U G S → ""gaugs"" – valid (plural of gaug).  

""gaugs"" is better than ""balks"".  

Both ""balks"" and ""gaugs"" fit. ""gaugs"" is more common.  

Thus, next guess: G A U G S → ""gaugs"".  

But let's double-check excluded letters: G, A, U, G, S – none are excluded.

From the latest feedback:

Guess 5: balks → B(x) A(✓) L(-) K(x) S(✓)

Key deductions:
- A is fixed in slot 2 (already known).
- S is fixed in slot 5 (already known).
- B and K are NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in slot 3.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ S  
And L must appear somewhere in slots 1 or 4 (since it can’t be 3).

Excluded letters so far: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, H, Y, G, U, B, K.

Remaining consonants: D, F, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: none (A is used, E, I, O, U excluded).

Possible words fitting _ A _ _ S with L in slot 1 or 4:
- L A _ _ S → L must be in slot 1 (can’t be 3 or 5, and 2 is A)
- _ A _ L S → L in slot 4

Check valid words:
1. L A _ _ S: Only possible is ""large"" but E is excluded. ""lamps"" – P allowed, but pattern is _ A _ _ S → ""lamps"" fits: L A M P S.
2. _ A _ L S: No common words (e.g., ""dallas"" but L would be in 3, which is invalid).

""Lamps"" is a valid 5-letter word using allowed letters:
- L in slot 1 (allowed, since L must be in word but not in slot 3)
- A in slot 2 (fixed)
- M, P in slots 3,4 (allowed)
- S in slot 5 (fixed)

No excluded letters used: R, O, E, I, N, T, C, H, Y, G, U, B, K are not in ""lamps"".
