For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which covers many common letters. Or ""CRANE"" - C, R, A, N, E. 

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because the letters A, O, E are very common vowels and R, S are common consonants. It gives us good coverage across the alphabet.

But to be more inclusive, maybe ""AUDIO"" is too vowel-heavy. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, S  
Letters in the word somewhere: A, O, E  
Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, O≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or S.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for A, O, E:
A can be in 2,3,4,5  
O can be in 1,2,4,5  
E can be in 1,2,3,4  

We still need two more letters (since we’ve only used 3 distinct letters so far).  
We should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O, C, E, A, N.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O≠3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A≠1).
- No R or S.

Another candidate is “COATE” (but T and C are fine), but “OCEAN” seems more common.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 4 (from OCEAN)
- O: not 3 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from OCEAN)
- E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from OCEAN)

So the only remaining legal positions for each of A, O, E are:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- O: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need two more distinct letters (none of which can be R, S, C, N). Common unused consonants include D, L, T, B, G, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, E in the remaining spots and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising arrangement:
- Put E in position 1 (legal).
- Put O in position 2 (legal).
- Put A in position 5 (legal).
- Positions 3 and 4 must be new letters. Let’s pick T and D (both unused so far).

That gives the word E O _ _ _ → E O T D ? Wait, we need 5 letters total. Let’s try E O T A _ but A is already placed at 5. Actually we need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

How about E O T D? That’s only 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me rephrase: the word must contain A, O, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not R,S,C,N). The new letters can be placed anywhere not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “DOATE”:
- D and T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (legal).
- A is in position 3 (legal).
- E is in position 5 (legal).
- No R, S, C, N.

But “DOATE” is not a common English word.

Another candidate: “LOATE” – but L and O are fine, but “LOATE” is also uncommon.

“BEAT” is 4 letters.

“MEANT” – N is out.

“GLOAT” – O in 2, A in 3, E in 5, G and L new. “GLOAT” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- G (new), L (new)
- O in 2 (legal)
- A in 3 (legal)
- T (new)
- E in 5 (legal)

This satisfies all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which covers many common letters. Or ""CRANE"" - C, R, A, N, E.

But to be more inclusive, maybe ""AUDIO"" is too vowel-heavy. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, S  
Letters in the word somewhere: A, O, E  
Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, O≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or S.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for A, O, E:
A can be in 2,3,4,5  
O can be in 1,2,4,5  
E can be in 1,2,3,4  

We still need two more letters (since we’ve only used 3 distinct letters so far).  
We should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O, C, E, A, N.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O≠3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A≠1).
- No R or S.

Another candidate is “COATE” (but T and C are fine), but “OCEAN” seems more common.

I’ll go with “OCEAN”.

Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 4 (from OCEAN)
- O: not 3 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from OCEAN)
- E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from OCEAN)

So the only remaining legal positions for each of A, O, E are:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- O: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need two more distinct letters (none of which can be R, S, C, N). Common unused consonants include D, L, T, B, G, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, E in the remaining spots and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising arrangement:
- Put E in position 1 (legal).
- Put O in position 2 (legal).
- Put A in position 5 (legal).
- Positions 3 and 4 must be new letters. Let’s pick T and D (both unused so far).

That gives the word E O _ _ _ → E O T D ? Wait, we need 5 letters total. Let’s try E O T A _ but A is already placed at 5. Actually we need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

How about E O T D? That’s only 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me rephrase: the word must contain A, O, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not R,S,C,N). The new letters can be placed anywhere not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “DOATE”:
- D and T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (legal).
- A is in position 3 (legal).
- E is in position 5 (legal).
- No R, S, C, N.

But “DOATE” is not a common English word.

Another candidate: “LOATE” – but L and O are fine, but “LOATE” is also uncommon.

“BEAT” is 4 letters.

Let me try “BEACH” – but C is out.

“MEANT” – N is out.

“GLOAT” – O in 2, A in 3, E in 5, G and L new. “GLOAT” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- G (new), L (new)
- O in 2 (legal)
- A in 3 (legal)
- T (new)
- E in 5 (legal)

This satisfies all constraints.

So I’ll guess GLOAT.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, C, N, G, L, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out for each of A, O, E:
- A: not 1 (AROSE), not 4 (OCEAN), not 3 (GLOAT) → only possible in 2 or 5
- O: not 3 (AROSE), not 1 (OCEAN), not 2 (GLOAT) → only possible in 4 or 5
- E: not 5 (AROSE), not 3 (OCEAN) → but position 5 is now also ruled out for E by GLOAT (E is in position 4 in GLOAT, so E not 4), so E must be in position 1 or 2

Wait, let's re-examine E's positions:
- E is in position 3 in OCEAN → feedback was E(-) meaning E is in word but not 3
- E is in position 4 in GLOAT → feedback was E not in 4 (since E was in position 4 in GLOAT and got (-), meaning it's in word but not 4)
- E is in position 3 in AROSE → feedback was E(-) meaning E is in word but not 5
So E cannot be in 3 or 4 or 5 → E must be in position 1 or 2

Similarly for A:
- A is in position 1 (AROSE) → A not 1
- A is in position 4 (OCEAN) → A not 4
- A is in position 3 (GLOAT) → A not 3
So A must be in position 2 or 5

For O:
- O is in position 3 (AROSE) → O not 3
- O is in position 1 (OCEAN) → O not 1
- O is in position 2 (GLOAT) → O not 2
So O must be in position 4 or 5

Now we have:
- E must be in 1 or 2
- A must be in 2 or 5
- O must be in 4 or 5

Let's consider possible combinations:

Case 1: E in 1, A in 2, O in 4
Word structure: E A _ O _
Letters left: positions 3 and 5 need new letters (not R,S,C,N,G,L,T)
Available letters: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need two distinct letters from these.

Possible words:
E A _ O _
Let's try E A M O D → ""EAMOD"" – not a word
E A B O D – not a word
E A D O M – ""EADOM"" – not common
E A P O D – not a word
E A B O K – ""EABOK"" – no
E A D O B – ""EADOB"" – no
E A F O D – ""EAFOD"" – no
E A H O D – ""EAHOD"" – no
E A M O D – already considered
E A V O D – ""EAVOD"" – no
E A W O D – ""EAWOD"" – no
E A X O D – ""EAXOD"" – no
E A Z O D – ""EAZOD"" – no

Case 2: E in 1, A in 5, O in 4
Structure: E _ _ O A
Letters: positions 2 and 3 need new letters
Possible: E D I O A – ""EDIOA"" – no
E D M O A – ""EDMOA"" – no
E D P O A – ""EDPOA"" – no
E D B O A – ""EDBOA"" – no
E D H O A – ""EDHOA"" – no
E D K O A – ""EDKOA"" – no
E D V O A – ""EDVOA"" – no
E D W O A – ""EDWOA"" – no
E D X O A – ""EDXOA"" – no
E D Y O A – ""EDYOA"" – no
E D Z O A – ""EDZOA"" – no

Case 3: E in 2, A in 5, O in 4
Structure: _ E _ O A
Letters: positions 1 and 3
Possible: B E D O A – ""BEDOA"" – no
D E B O A – ""DEBOA"" – no
F E D O A – ""FEDOA"" – no
H E D O A – ""HEDOA"" – no
J E D O A – ""JEDOA"" – no
K E D O A – ""KEDOA"" – no
M E D O A – ""MEDOA"" – no
P E D O A – ""PEDOA"" – no
V E D O A – ""VEDOA"" – no
W E D O A – ""WEDOA"" – no
X E D O A – ""XEDOA"" – no
Y E D O A – ""YEDOA"" – no
Z E D O A – ""ZEDOA"" – no

Case 4: E in 2, A in 2 – impossible, A and E can't both be in 2

Case 5: E in 1, A in 2, O in 5
Structure: E A _ _ O
Letters: positions 3 and 4
Possible: E A B D O – ""EABDO"" – no
E A D B O – ""EADB O"" – no
E A D M O – ""EADMO"" – no
E A D P O – ""EADPO"" – no
E A D H O – ""EADHO"" – no
E A D K O – ""EADKO"" – no
E A D V O – ""EADVO"" – no
E A D W O – ""EADWO"" – no
E A D X O – ""EADXO"" – no
E A D Y O – ""EADYO"" – no
E A D Z O – ""EADZO"" – no

Case 6: E in 1, A in 5, O in 5 – impossible

Case 7: E in 2, A in 5, O in 5 – impossible

Case 8: E in 1, A in 2, O in 4 – already considered Case 1

Case 9: E in 1, A in 5, O in 4 – already considered Case 2

Case 10: E in 2, A in 5, O in 4 – already considered Case 3

Case 11: E in 2, A in 2 – impossible

Case 12: E in 1, A in 2, O in 5 – already considered Case 5

It seems like none of these combinations form valid English words. Maybe I need to reconsider the available letters or word structures.

Alternative approach: list all 5-letter English words containing A, O, E exactly once each, with no R,S,C,N,G,L,T, and check positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which covers many common letters. Or ""CRANE"" - C, R, A, N, E. 

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because the letters A, O, E are very common vowels and R, S are common consonants. It gives us good coverage across the alphabet.

But to be more inclusive, maybe ""AUDIO"" is too vowel-heavy. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, S  
Letters in the word somewhere: A, O, E  
Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, O≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or S.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for A, O, E:
A can be in 2,3,4,5  
O can be in 1,2,4,5  
E can be in 1,2,3,4  

We still need two more letters (since we’ve only used 3 distinct letters so far).  
We should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O, C, E, A, N.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O≠3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A≠1).
- No R or S.

Another candidate is “COATE” (but T and C are fine), but “OCEAN” seems more common.

I’ll go with “OCEAN”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 4 (from OCEAN)
- O: not 3 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from OCEAN)
- E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from OCEAN)

So the only remaining legal positions for each of A, O, E are:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- O: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need two more distinct letters (none of which can be R, S, C, N). Common unused consonants include D, L, T, B, G, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, E in the remaining spots and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising arrangement:
- Put E in position 1 (legal).
- Put O in position 2 (legal).
- Put A in position 5 (legal).
- Positions 3 and 4 must be new letters. Let’s pick T and D (both unused so far).

That gives the word E O _ _ _ → E O T D ? Wait, we need 5 letters total. Let’s try E O T A _ but A is already placed at 5. Actually we need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

How about E O T D? That’s only 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me rephrase: the word must contain A, O, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not R,S,C,N). The new letters can be placed anywhere not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “DOATE”:
- D and T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (legal).
- A is in position 3 (legal).
- E is in position 5 (legal).
- No R, S, C, N.

But “DOATE” is not a common English word.

Another candidate: “LOATE” – but L and O are fine, but “LOATE” is also uncommon.

“BEAT” is 4 letters.

Let me try “BEACH” – but C is out.

“MEANT” – N is out.

“GLOAT” – O in 2, A in 3, E in 5, G and L new. “GLOAT” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- G (new), L (new)
- O in 2 (legal)
- A in 3 (legal)
- T (new)
- E in 5 (legal)

This satisfies all constraints.

So I’ll guess GLOAT.

It gives us good coverage across the alphabet.\n\nBut to be more inclusive, maybe ""AUDIO"" is too vowel-heavy. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).\n- R is not in the word at all.\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).\n- S is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).\n\nSo we know:\nLetters not in the word: R, S  \nLetters in the word somewhere: A, O, E  \nPositions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, O≠3, E≠5\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in AROSE).\n- Does NOT contain R or S.\n- Places A somewhere other than position 1.\n- Places O somewhere other than position 3.\n- Places E somewhere other than position 5.\n\nPossible positions for A, O, E:\nA can be in 2,3,4,5  \nO can be in 1,2,4,5  \nE can be in 1,2,3,4  \n\nWe still need two more letters (since we’ve only used 3 distinct letters so far).  \nWe should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nA good candidate is “OCEAN”:\n- Contains O, C, E, A, N.\n- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O≠3).\n- C and N are new letters.\n- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5).\n- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A≠1).\n- No R or S.\n\nAnother candidate is “COATE” (but T and C are fine), but “OCEAN” seems more common.\n\nI’ll go with “OCEAN”.\n\n<guess>OCEAN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two previous guesses we now know:\n\nLetters that are NOT in the word: R, S, C, N  \nLetters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  \n\nPositions ruled out so far:\n- A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 4 (from OCEAN)\n- O: not 3 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from OCEAN)\n- E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from OCEAN)\n\nSo the only remaining legal positions for each of A, O, E are:\n- A: 2, 3, 5\n- O: 2, 4, 5\n- E: 1, 2, 4\n\nWe still need two more distinct letters (none of which can be R, S, C, N).

Let’s summarize everything we know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word  
R, S (from AROSE)  
C, N (from OCEAN)  
G, L, T (from GLOAT)  

Letters that ARE in the word (each exactly once)  
A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far  
- A: not 1 (AROSE), not 4 (OCEAN), not 3 (GLOAT) → A must be in 2 or 5  
- O: not 3 (AROSE), not 1 (OCEAN), not 2 (GLOAT) → O must be in 4 or 5  
- E: not 5 (AROSE), not 3 (OCEAN) → E must be in 1, 2 or 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, O, E exactly once each  
2. Contains two new letters (not R,S,C,N,G,L,T)  
3. Places A in 2 or 5  
4. Places O in 4 or 5  
5. Places E in 1, 2 or 4  

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Option 1: Put A in 2, O in 4, E in 1  
Pattern: E A _ O _  
We need two new consonants for positions 3 and 5.  
Good candidates: D, B, M, F, H, etc.  
Try E A M O D → “EAMOD” – not a real word.  
Try E A M O B → “EAMOB” – not real.  
Try E A D O M → “EADOM” – not real.  
Try E A B O D – not real.  

Option 2: Put A in 2, O in 5, E in 1 or 4  
Pattern 1: E A _ _ O  
Need two new letters for 3 and 4.  
Try E A D M O – not a word.  
Try E A M D O – not a word.  
Try E A M B O – not a word.  

Pattern 2: _ A _ E O  
A in 2, E in 4, O in 5.  
Need letters 1 and 3.  
Try B A M E O – not a word.  
Try D A M E O – not a word.  
Try F A M E O – not a word.  

Option 3: Put A in 5, O in 4, E in 1 or 2  
Pattern 1: E _ _ O A  
Try E D M O A – not a word.  
Try E M D O A – not a word.  

Pattern 2: _ E _ O A  
Try B E D O A – not a word.  
Try M E D O A – not a word.  

Option 4: Put A in 5, O in 4, E in 2  
Pattern: _ E A O _  
Need letters 1 and 5.  
Try B E A O D – not a word.  
Try D E A O B – not a word.  

Option 5: Put A in 5, O in 4, E in 1  
Pattern: E _ _ O A  
Try E D M O A – not a word.  

Let’s list valid English words that fit the constraints.

Valid letters left: B, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Try “PEACH” – but C is out.  
Try “MEANT” – N is out.  
Try “BEACH” – C is out.  
Try “HEAVE” – contains H, E, A, V, E – but E appears twice (invalid).  
Try “HEXED” – X and D are okay, but no A or O.  
Try “MEDIA” – contains D, I, A – but no O.  
Try “VODKA” – O, K, A – but V, D, K okay, but word has O in 2, A in 5 – but O must be 4 or 5, so O in 2 is invalid.  
Try “PODGY” – P, O, D, G, Y – G is out.  
Try “FOAMY” – F, O, A, M, Y – O in 2 is invalid.  
Try “MOCHA” – M, O, C, H, A – C is out.  
Try “BOGUS” – S is out.  
Try “DOUGH” – G is out.  
Try “WOKEN” – N is out.  

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions.

We need a word with A, O, E and two new letters, respecting the position rules.

Let’s try:

- A in 2, O in 4, E in 1 → E A _ O _  
  Need letters 3 and 5 from remaining: B, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
  Try E A M O D – not a word.  
  Try E A B O D – not a word.  
  Try E A D O M – not a word.  
  Try E A P O D – not a word.  

- A in 2, O in 5, E in 1 or 4  
  E A _ _ O or _ A _ E O  
  E A D M O – not a word.  
  _ A M E O – not a word.  

- A in 5, O in 4, E in 1 or 2  
  E _ _ O A or _ E _ O A  
  E D M O A – not a word.  
  B E D O A – not a word.  

- A in 5, O in 4, E in 2  
  _ E A O _  
  B E A O D – not a word.  

Let me try “PEACH” – no, C is out.  
Try “HEXED” – no A or O.  

Wait, let’s try “HEAVE” – H, E, A, V, E – E twice, invalid.  

Try “MEDIA” – M, E, D, I, A – no O.  

Try “VODKA” – V, O, D, K, A – O in 2 is invalid.  

Try “BOGUS” – S is out.  

Try “DOUGH” – G is out.  

Try “MEWED” – no O.  

Try “PEWED” – no O.  

Try “HEWED” – no O.  

Try “HEXED” – no O.  

Try “MEDIA” – no O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which covers many common letters. Or ""CRANE"" - C, R, A, N, E. 

I think ""AROSE"" is slightly better because the letters A, O, E are very common vowels and R, S are common consonants. It gives us good coverage across the alphabet.

But to be more inclusive, maybe ""AUDIO"" is too vowel-heavy. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (not third).
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
Letters not in the word: R, S  
Letters in the word somewhere: A, O, E  
Positions to avoid for those letters: A≠1, O≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, E (each exactly once, since they only appeared once in AROSE).
- Does NOT contain R or S.
- Places A somewhere other than position 1.
- Places O somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for A, O, E:
A can be in 2,3,4,5  
O can be in 1,2,4,5  
E can be in 1,2,3,4  

We still need two more letters (since we’ve only used 3 distinct letters so far).  
We should pick common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- Contains O, C, E, A, N.
- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O≠3).
- C and N are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5).
- A is in position 4 (allowed, since A≠1).
- No R or S.

Another candidate is “COATE” (but T and C are fine), but “OCEAN” seems more common.

I’ll go with “OCEAN”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1 (from AROSE) and not 4 (from OCEAN)
- O: not 3 (from AROSE) and not 1 (from OCEAN)
- E: not 5 (from AROSE) and not 3 (from OCEAN)

So the only remaining legal positions for each of A, O, E are:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- O: 2, 4, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

We still need two more distinct letters (none of which can be R, S, C, N). Common unused consonants include D, L, T, B, G, M, etc.

Let’s try to place A, O, E in the remaining spots and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising arrangement:
- Put E in position 1 (legal).
- Put O in position 2 (legal).
- Put A in position 5 (legal).
- Positions 3 and 4 must be new letters. Let’s pick T and D (both unused so far).

That gives the word E O _ _ _ → E O T D ? Wait, we need 5 letters total. Let’s try E O T A _ but A is already placed at 5. Actually we need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.

How about E O T D? That’s only 4 letters. We need 5.

Let me rephrase: the word must contain A, O, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not R,S,C,N). The new letters can be placed anywhere not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “DOATE”:
- D and T are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (legal).
- A is in position 3 (legal).
- E is in position 5 (legal).
- No R, S, C, N.

But “DOATE” is not a common English word.

Another candidate: “LOATE” – but L and O are fine, but “LOATE” is also uncommon.

“BEAT” is 4 letters.

Let me try “BEACH” – but C is out.

“MEANT” – N is out.

“GLOAT” – O in 2, A in 3, E in 5, G and L new. “GLOAT” is a valid word.

Check positions:
- G (new), L (new)
- O in 2 (legal)
- A in 3 (legal)
- T (new)
- E in 5 (legal)

This satisfies all constraints.

So I’ll guess GLOAT.

Let’s try to place A, O, E in the only remaining legal spots and fill the rest with new letters.

Case 1: A in 2, O in 4, E in 1  
Word pattern: E A _ O _  
Need two new letters for positions 3 and 5.  
Try E A D O M → “EADOM” (not a word).  
Try E A B O D → “EABOD” (not a word).  
Try E A M O D → “EAMOD” (not a word).  
Try E A D O B → “EADOB” (not a word).  

Case 2: A in 2, O in 5, E in 1  
Pattern: E A _ _ O  
Need letters for 3 and 4.  
Try E A M B O → “EAMBO” (not a word).  
Try E A D B O → “EADBO” (not a word).  
Try E A M D O → “EAMDO” (not a word).  

Case 3: A in 2, O in 4, E in 5  
Pattern: _ A _ O E  
Need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try B A D O E → “BAD OE” (not a word).  
Try D A M O E → “DAMOE” (not a word).  
Try F A M O E → “FAMOE” (not a word).  

Case 4: A in 5, O in 4, E in 1  
Pattern: E _ _ O A  
Need letters for 2 and 3.  
Try E M B O A → “EMBOA” (not a word).  
Try E D M O A → “EDMOA” (not a word).  
Try E B D O A → “EBDOA” (not a word).  

Case 5: A in 5, O in 4, E in 2  
Pattern: _ E _ O A  
Need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try D E M O A → “DEMOA” (not a word).  
Try B E D O A → “BEDOA” (not a word).  
Try F E D O A → “FEDOA” (not a word).  

Case 6: A in 5, O in 4, E in 1  
Same as Case 4, already tried.

Case 7: A in 2, O in 5, E in 4  
Pattern: _ A E _ O  
Need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try D A E M O → “DAEMO” (not a word).  
Try B A E M O → “BAEMO” (not a word).  
Try F A E M O → “FAEMO” (not a word).  

Case 8: A in 5, O in 2, E in 1  
Pattern: E O _ _ A  
Need letters for 3 and 4.  
Try E O B D A → “EOBDA” (not a word).  
Try E O D B A → “EODBA” (not a word).  
Try E O M B A → “EOMBA” (not a word).  

Case 9: A in 2, O in 5, E in 4  
Same as Case 7.

Case 10: A in 5, O in 2, E in 4  
Pattern: _ O E _ A  
Need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try B O E M A → “BOEMA” (valid word, a mountain in Switzerland).  
Check constraints:
- B: new letter, allowed.
- O: position 2 (legal, not ruled out).
- E: position 3 (legal, not ruled out).
- M: new letter, allowed.
- A: position 5 (legal, not ruled out).

“BOEMA” is a valid 5-letter English word and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is BOEMA.

Letters NOT in the word: R, S, C, N, G, L, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (each once): A, O, E  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: not 1 (AROSE), not 4 (OCEAN), not 3 (GLOAT) → must be in 2 or 5
- O: not 3 (AROSE), not 1 (OCEAN), not 2 (GLOAT) → must be in 4 or 5
