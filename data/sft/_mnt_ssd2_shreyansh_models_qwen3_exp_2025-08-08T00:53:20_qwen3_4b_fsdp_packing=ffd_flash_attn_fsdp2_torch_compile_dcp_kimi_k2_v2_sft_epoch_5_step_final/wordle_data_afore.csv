For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these to cover as much ground as possible.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O is correct in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is correct in position 5.

So far we know the pattern is: A _ O _ E, with an R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 and 5 are already taken by O and E), so R must be in position 4.

That gives us: A _ O R E.

Now we just need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ O R E. The missing letter is position 2. Common letters that fit here and make a valid word are: B (ABORE), C (ACORE), D (ADORE), F (AFORE), H (AHORE), L (ALORE), M (AMORE), N (ANORE), P (APORE), T (ATORE), W (AWORE), etc.

Among these, ""ADORE"" is a common word and seems like a good choice.
