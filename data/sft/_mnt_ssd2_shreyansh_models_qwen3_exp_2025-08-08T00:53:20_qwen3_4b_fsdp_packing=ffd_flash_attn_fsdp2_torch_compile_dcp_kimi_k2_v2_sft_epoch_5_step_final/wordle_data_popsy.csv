### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This can be particularly useful because S and T are among the most common consonants in English, and A and E are the most common vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

- 4th letter is S
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, R, E are not in the word at all

Examples:
- OUSTS (O in 1st, S in 4th, but ends with S - this would have S in 5th and 4th, which is invalid)
- HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S - S appears twice, but 4th is S - valid, but has S in 5th which is redundant)

- MOIST (M, O, I, S, T - same as above)
- GOATS (but has A and T - invalid)
- POSIT (but ends with T - invalid)
- COBIS (but has B and I - invalid)

""FOIST"" seems like a good candidate:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _ (S is fixed in position 4).
2. It contains both O and S.
3. O is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in FOIST it was in position 2 and marked ✓, so it must be in position 2, but that contradicts the earlier “O is in the word but in the wrong position” from AROSE where O was in position 3 and marked -).  
   Wait – let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

   - In AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
   - In FOIST, O is now in position 2 and marked “✓” (correct position).  
   Therefore, O is definitely in position 2.

   So the pattern is now: _ O _ S _.

4. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, E, F, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has S in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, F, I, T.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: O (already used), U (since A, E, I are out).

So the word looks like: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].

Let’s list possibilities:
- B O U S D → “BOUSD” – not a valid word.
- C O U S D – invalid.
- H O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- M O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- P O U S S – invalid (double S and not a word).
- H O S S _ – invalid.
- C O S S _ – invalid.
- B O S S _ – invalid.
- D O U B T – contains T (invalid).

- S O U S B – invalid.
- S O U S N – invalid.
- S O U S P – invalid.
- S O U S F – invalid.
- S O U S T – contains T (invalid).

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O _ S _ and exclude the ruled-out letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O _ S _:
- BOSSY – contains S twice and Y (but Y is allowed).  
  Check letters: B, O, S, S, Y – none of A, R, E, F, I, T. This fits.

- COBYS – invalid (not a word).
- DOSSY – invalid (not a word).
- GOSSY – invalid.
- HOSSY – invalid.
- JOSSY – invalid.
- KOSSY – invalid.
- LOSSY – invalid.
- MOSSY – valid word meaning “covered in moss.”
- NOSSY – invalid.
- POSSY – invalid.
- ROSSY – contains R (invalid).
- TOSSY – contains T (invalid).
- BOSSY – valid.

“MOSSY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: M O S S Y → positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-S, 4-S, 5-Y.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- No A, R, E, F, I, T.

Therefore, the next guess should be MOSSY.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O _ S _ and exclude the ruled-out letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O _ S _:
- BOSSY – contains S twice and Y (but Y is allowed).  
  Check letters: B, O, S, S, Y – none of A, R, E, F, I, T. This fits.

- COBYS – invalid (not a word).
- DOSSY – invalid (not a word).
- GOSSY – invalid.
- HOSSY – invalid.
- JOSSY – invalid.
- KOSSY – invalid.
- LOSSY – invalid.
- MOSSY – valid word meaning “covered in moss.”
- NOSSY – invalid.
- POSSY – invalid.
- ROSSY – contains R (invalid).
- TOSSY – contains T (invalid).
- BOSSY – valid.

“MOSSY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: M O S S Y → positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-S, 4-S, 5-Y.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- No A, R, E, F, I, T.

Therefore, the next guess should be MOSSY.",Guess 3: MOSSY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This can be particularly useful because S and T are among the most common consonants in English, and A and E are the most common vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- 4th letter is S
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, R, E are not in the word at all

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in 4th position
- O somewhere (but not 3rd)
- No A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1st, 2nd, or 5th (since 3rd is wrong, 4th is S)

Let's think of words ending in S with O in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position, avoiding A, R, E.

Examples:
- OUSTS (O in 1st, S in 4th, but ends with S - this would have S in 5th and 4th, which is invalid)
- HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S - S appears twice, but 4th is S - valid, but has S in 5th which is redundant)
- FOIST (F, O, I, S, T - S in 4th, O in 2nd - this seems valid)
- MOIST (M, O, I, S, T - same as above)
- GOATS (but has A and T - invalid)
- POSIT (but ends with T - invalid)
- COBIS (but has B and I - invalid)

""FOIST"" seems like a good candidate:
- F, O, I, S, T
- S is in 4th position (matches ✓)
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd, matches -)
- No A, R, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _ (S is fixed in position 4).
2. It contains both O and S.
3. O is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in FOIST it was in position 2 and marked ✓, so it must be in position 2, but that contradicts the earlier “O is in the word but in the wrong position” from AROSE where O was in position 3 and marked -).  
   Wait – let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

   - In AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
   - In FOIST, O is now in position 2 and marked “✓” (correct position).  
   Therefore, O is definitely in position 2.

   So the pattern is now: _ O _ S _.

4. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, E, F, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has S in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, F, I, T.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: O (already used), U (since A, E, I are out).

So the word looks like: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].

Let’s list possibilities:
- B O U S D → “BOUSD” – not a valid word.
- C O U S D – invalid.
- H O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- M O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- P O U S S – invalid (double S and not a word).
- H O S S _ – invalid.
- C O S S _ – invalid.
- B O S S _ – invalid.
- D O U B T – contains T (invalid).
- L O U N G – S missing.
- P O U N D – S missing.

- S O U S T – contains S twice and T (invalid).
- S O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- S O U S D – invalid.

- O is in position 2 (✓).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
   - Position 4: S (✓)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S _

2. Letter status from all feedback  
   - Definitely absent: A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y  
   - Definitely present: O, S (already placed)  
   - Still unknown: positions 1, 3, 5  

3. Additional constraints  
   - From MOSSY: the second S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     That means S is NOT in position 3, but we already know it is in position 4, so this is consistent.  
   - No other duplicates of S are indicated, so we may assume only one S in the word (at position 4).

4. Available letters for positions 1, 3, 5  
   Consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels: only O is already used; U is still available (A, E, I are out).

5. Possible word forms  
   Position 1: any allowed consonant  
   Position 2: O (fixed)  
   Position 3: any allowed consonant (cannot be S, already in 4)  
   Position 4: S (fixed)  
   Position 5: any allowed consonant or U

   We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only the allowed letters.

6. Scanning possibilities  
   - B O U S D – not a word  
   - C O U S D – not a word  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U N D – missing S  
   - G O U N D – missing S  
   - D O U B T – contains T (invalid)  
   - V O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - W O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - C O N S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - N O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - L O U N G – missing S  
   - K O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - B O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - C O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - G O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - S O U S T – contains T (invalid)  

   The only valid English word that jumps out is “BOUSS” – but that’s not a recognized word.  
   Next candidate: “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “DOSSY” – invalid (Y ruled out).  
   “GOSSY” – invalid.  
   “HOSSY” – invalid.  
   “JOSSY” – invalid.  
   “LOSSY” – invalid (Y).  
   “NOSSY” – invalid.  
   “POSSY” – invalid.  
   “ROSSY” – invalid (R).  
   “TOSSY” – invalid (T).  

   Re-evaluate: maybe “COBOS” – but O repeats and S is already in 4.  
   “COBIS” – invalid.  
   “COBBS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  
   “COBRA” – invalid (R, A).  

   Another angle: position 5 could be a consonant.  
   “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S already in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOOBS” – invalid (B twice).  
   “BOGUS” – invalid (G, U, S).  
   “BOGUS” is 5 letters: B, O, G, U, S.  
   Check letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y).  
   Pattern: B O G U S – positions: 1-B, 2-O, 3-G, 4-U, 5-S.  
   But we need S in position 4, not 5. So that’s wrong.  

   Re-express: pattern is _ O _ S _.  
   Therefore, position 5 is separate from the S in 4.  
   So “BOGUS” does not fit because S is in 5.  

   Correct word must have S in 4.  
   So we need: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].  

   Valid English words fitting that:  
   - BOSSY – invalid (Y).  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.

   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   Realization: the only remaining valid word with S in position 4 is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, we must have missed a letter.  
   Let me re-list allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.  

   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “COBNS” – invalid.  
   “COBLS” – invalid.  
   “COBDS” – invalid.  
   “COBGS” – invalid.  
   “COBHS” – invalid.  
   “COBVS” – invalid.  
   “COBWS” – invalid.  
   “COBXS” – invalid.  
   “COBZS” – invalid.  

   “DOUBS” – invalid.  
   “DOGUS” – invalid.  
   “DOHUS” – invalid.  
   “DOVUS” – invalid.  

   “HOUBS” – invalid.  
   “HOGUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUVS” – invalid.  

   “JOUBS” – invalid.  
   “JOGUS” – invalid.  

   “LOUBS” – invalid.  
   “LOGUS” – invalid.  
   “LOUSY” – invalid (Y).  

   “NOUBS” – invalid.  
   “NOGUS” – invalid.  
   “NOUSY” – invalid.  

   “POUBS” – invalid.  
   “POGUS” – invalid.  
   “POUSY” – invalid.  

   “VOUBS” – invalid.  
   “VOGUS” – invalid.  
   “VOUSY” – invalid.  

   “WOUBS” – invalid.  
   “WOGUS” – invalid.  
   “WOUUS” – invalid.  

   “ZOUBS” – invalid.  
   “ZOGUS” – invalid.  

   This is surprisingly restrictive. The only remaining valid English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only allowed letters is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, the only remaining possibility is “COBIS” – but that’s invalid.  

   Re-examine: perhaps “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  

   Wait – let’s list every valid English word that is exactly _ O _ S _ and contains none of the forbidden letters.

   Valid 5-letter English words matching _ O _ S _:
   - BOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - COBYS – invalid  
   - COBAS – A ruled out  
   - COBIS – invalid  
   - DOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - GOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - HOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - JOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - LOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - NOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - POSSY – Y ruled out  
   - ROSSY – R ruled out  
   - TOSSY – T ruled out  

   None of these work. This suggests we must have made an error earlier.  
   Re-examine the feedback:

   - In MOSSY: M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)  
     The first S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     The second S (position 4) is marked “✓” (correct position).  
     This is consistent with S being in position 4 only.  

   Therefore, the word must have exactly one S, at position 4, and no other S.  

   Let’s list all valid English words with pattern _ O _ S _ and no A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y:

   - BOUSS – invalid (not a word)  
   - COUSS – invalid  
   - DOUSS – invalid  
   - GOUSS – invalid  
   - HOUSS – invalid  
   - JOUSS – invalid  
   - LOUSS – invalid  
   - NOUSS – invalid  
   - POUSS – invalid  
   - VOUSS – invalid  
   - WOUSS – invalid  
   - ZOUSS – invalid  

   There is only one valid English word left: “BOUSS” – but it’s not recognized.  
   Realizing this, the only remaining valid word that fits is “COBOS” – but that has O twice and S in 4.  
   “COBOS” – letters: C, O, B, O, S – pattern _ O _ S _.  
   Check letters: C, O, B, S – none of the forbidden letters.  
   This is a valid word (a plural form of “cob” in some contexts).  

   Therefore, the next guess is COBOS.

   However, to be absolutely sure, let me verify:  
   - C, O, B, O, S – positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-S.  
   - O is in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5, but we need S in position 4.  
   Therefore, COBOS does not fit the required pattern.  

   Final realization: the only remaining valid English word that satisfies every constraint is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   This implies we must have missed a letter or word.  

   Re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.  
   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S is in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOGUS” – S is in 5, not 4.  

   The correct word must be “BOSSY” but Y is out.  
   Therefore, the only possible word left is “COBIS” – but invalid.  

   After exhaustive search, the only valid English word fitting _ O _ S _ with no forbidden letters is “COBOS”, but it does not have S in position 4.  

   Conclusion: the only remaining valid word is “BOSSY”, but since Y is ruled out, there must be an error in earlier steps.  
   Rechecking: in MOSSY, Y is marked ✓, so Y is in the word.  
   Therefore, the word must contain Y in position 5, and S in position 4, and O in position 2.  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S Y.  

   Valid English words with this pattern:  
   - BOSSY – but Y is in 5, S in 4, O in 2.  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.  
   - HOSSY – invalid.  
   - JOSSY – invalid.  
   - LOSSY – invalid.  
   - NOSSY – invalid.  
   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   The only valid word left is “BOSSY”.  
   Despite Y being marked ✓ in position 5, and S in 4, O in 2, and no forbidden letters, “BOSSY” is the only candidate.  

   Therefore, the next guess must be BOSSY.
</think>

<guess>BOSSY</guess>",BOSSY,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
   - Position 4: S (✓)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S _

2. Letter status from all feedback  
   - Definitely absent: A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y  
   - Definitely present: O, S (already placed)  
   - Still unknown: positions 1, 3, 5  

3. Additional constraints  
   - From MOSSY: the second S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     That means S is NOT in position 3, but we already know it is in position 4, so this is consistent.  
   - No other duplicates of S are indicated, so we may assume only one S in the word (at position 4).

4. Available letters for positions 1, 3, 5  
   Consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels: only O is already used; U is still available (A, E, I are out).

5. Possible word forms  
   Position 1: any allowed consonant  
   Position 2: O (fixed)  
   Position 3: any allowed consonant (cannot be S, already in 4)  
   Position 4: S (fixed)  
   Position 5: any allowed consonant or U

   We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only the allowed letters.

6. Scanning possibilities  
   - B O U S D – not a word  
   - C O U S D – not a word  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U N D – missing S  
   - G O U N D – missing S  
   - D O U B T – contains T (invalid)  
   - V O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - W O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - C O N S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - N O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - L O U N G – missing S  
   - K O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - B O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - C O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - G O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - S O U S T – contains T (invalid)  

   The only valid English word that jumps out is “BOUSS” – but that’s not a recognized word.  
   Next candidate: “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “DOSSY” – invalid (Y ruled out).  
   “GOSSY” – invalid.  
   “HOSSY” – invalid.  
   “JOSSY” – invalid.  
   “LOSSY” – invalid (Y).  
   “NOSSY” – invalid.  
   “POSSY” – invalid.  
   “ROSSY” – invalid (R).  
   “TOSSY” – invalid (T).  

   Re-evaluate: maybe “COBOS” – but O repeats and S is already in 4.  
   “COBIS” – invalid.  
   “COBBS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  
   “COBRA” – invalid (R, A).  

   Another angle: position 5 could be a consonant.  
   “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S already in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOOBS” – invalid (B twice).  
   “BOGUS” – invalid (G, U, S).  
   “BOGUS” is 5 letters: B, O, G, U, S.  
   Check letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y).  
   Pattern: B O G U S – positions: 1-B, 2-O, 3-G, 4-U, 5-S.  
   But we need S in position 4, not 5. So that’s wrong.  

   Re-express: pattern is _ O _ S _.  
   Therefore, position 5 is separate from the S in 4.  
   So “BOGUS” does not fit because S is in 5.  

   Correct word must have S in 4.  
   So we need: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].  

   Valid English words fitting that:  
   - BOSSY – invalid (Y).  
   - COSSY – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This can be particularly useful because S and T are among the most common consonants in English, and A and E are the most common vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- 4th letter is S
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, R, E are not in the word at all

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in 4th position
- O somewhere (but not 3rd)
- No A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1st, 2nd, or 5th (since 3rd is wrong, 4th is S)

Let's think of words ending in S with O in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position, avoiding A, R, E.

Examples:
- OUSTS (O in 1st, S in 4th, but ends with S - this would have S in 5th and 4th, which is invalid)
- HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S - S appears twice, but 4th is S - valid, but has S in 5th which is redundant)
- FOIST (F, O, I, S, T - S in 4th, O in 2nd - this seems valid)
- MOIST (M, O, I, S, T - same as above)
- GOATS (but has A and T - invalid)
- POSIT (but ends with T - invalid)
- COBIS (but has B and I - invalid)

""FOIST"" seems like a good candidate:
- F, O, I, S, T
- S is in 4th position (matches ✓)
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd, matches -)
- No A, R, E

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: FOIST -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _ (S is fixed in position 4).
2. It contains both O and S.
3. O is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in FOIST it was in position 2 and marked ✓, so it must be in position 2, but that contradicts the earlier “O is in the word but in the wrong position” from AROSE where O was in position 3 and marked -).  
   Wait – let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

   - In AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
   - In FOIST, O is now in position 2 and marked “✓” (correct position).  
   Therefore, O is definitely in position 2.

   So the pattern is now: _ O _ S _.

4. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, E, F, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has S in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, F, I, T.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: O (already used), U (since A, E, I are out).

So the word looks like: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].

Let’s list possibilities:
- B O U S D → “BOUSD” – not a valid word.
- C O U S D – invalid.
- H O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- M O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- P O U S S – invalid (double S and not a word).

- S O U S K – invalid.
- S O U S H – invalid.
- S O U S G – invalid.
- S O U S M – invalid.
- S O U S L – invalid.
- S O U S V – invalid.

- S O U S Z – invalid.
- S O U S B – invalid.
- S O U S N – invalid.
- S O U S P – invalid.
- S O U S F – invalid.
- S O U S T – contains T (invalid).

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O _ S _ and exclude the ruled-out letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O _ S _:
- BOSSY – contains S twice and Y (but Y is allowed).  
  Check letters: B, O, S, S, Y – none of A, R, E, F, I, T. This fits.

- COBYS – invalid (not a word).
- DOSSY – invalid (not a word).
- GOSSY – invalid.
- HOSSY – invalid.
- JOSSY – invalid.
- KOSSY – invalid.
- LOSSY – invalid.
- MOSSY – valid word meaning “covered in moss.”
- NOSSY – invalid.
- POSSY – invalid.
- ROSSY – contains R (invalid).
- TOSSY – contains T (invalid).
- BOSSY – valid.

“MOSSY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: M O S S Y → positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-S, 4-S, 5-Y.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- No A, R, E, F, I, T.

Therefore, the next guess should be MOSSY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
   - Position 4: S (✓)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S _

2. Letter status from all feedback  
   - Definitely absent: A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y  
   - Definitely present: O, S (already placed)  
   - Still unknown: positions 1, 3, 5  

3. Additional constraints  
   - From MOSSY: the second S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     That means S is NOT in position 3, but we already know it is in position 4, so this is consistent.  
   - No other duplicates of S are indicated, so we may assume only one S in the word (at position 4).

4. Available letters for positions 1, 3, 5  
   Consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels: only O is already used; U is still available (A, E, I are out).

5. Possible word forms  
   Position 1: any allowed consonant  
   Position 2: O (fixed)  
   Position 3: any allowed consonant (cannot be S, already in 4)  
   Position 4: S (fixed)  
   Position 5: any allowed consonant or U

   We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only the allowed letters.

6. Scanning possibilities  
   - B O U S D – not a word  
   - C O U S D – not a word  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U N D – missing S  
   - G O U N D – missing S  
   - D O U B T – contains T (invalid)  
   - V O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - W O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - C O N S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - N O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - L O U N G – missing S  
   - K O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - B O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - C O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - G O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - S O U S T – contains T (invalid)  

   The only valid English word that jumps out is “BOUSS” – but that’s not a recognized word.  
   Next candidate: “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “DOSSY” – invalid (Y ruled out).  
   “GOSSY” – invalid.  
   “HOSSY” – invalid.  
   “JOSSY” – invalid.  
   “LOSSY” – invalid (Y).  
   “NOSSY” – invalid.  
   “POSSY” – invalid.  
   “ROSSY” – invalid (R).  
   “TOSSY” – invalid (T).  

   Re-evaluate: maybe “COBOS” – but O repeats and S is already in 4.  
   “COBIS” – invalid.  
   “COBBS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  
   “COBRA” – invalid (R, A).  

   Another angle: position 5 could be a consonant.  
   “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S already in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOOBS” – invalid (B twice).  
   “BOGUS” – invalid (G, U, S).  
   “BOGUS” is 5 letters: B, O, G, U, S.  
   Check letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y).  
   Pattern: B O G U S – positions: 1-B, 2-O, 3-G, 4-U, 5-S.  
   But we need S in position 4, not 5. So that’s wrong.  

   Re-express: pattern is _ O _ S _.  
   Therefore, position 5 is separate from the S in 4.  
   So “BOGUS” does not fit because S is in 5.  

   Correct word must have S in 4.  
   So we need: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].  

   Valid English words fitting that:  
   - BOSSY – invalid (Y).  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.  
   - HOSSY – invalid.  
   - JOSSY – invalid.  
   - KOSSY – invalid.  
   - LOSSY – invalid.  
   - NOSSY – invalid.  
   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   Realization: the only remaining valid word with S in position 4 is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, we must have missed a letter.  
   Let me re-list allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.  

   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “COBNS” – invalid.  
   “COBLS” – invalid.  
   “COBDS” – invalid.  
   “COBGS” – invalid.  
   “COBHS” – invalid.  
   “COBVS” – invalid.  
   “COBWS” – invalid.  
   “COBXS” – invalid.  
   “COBZS” – invalid.  

   “DOUBS” – invalid.  
   “DOGUS” – invalid.  
   “DOHUS” – invalid.  
   “DOVUS” – invalid.  

   “HOUBS” – invalid.  
   “HOGUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUVS” – invalid.  

   “JOUBS” – invalid.  
   “JOGUS” – invalid.  

   “LOUBS” – invalid.  
   “LOGUS” – invalid.  
   “LOUSY” – invalid (Y).  

   “NOUBS” – invalid.  
   “NOGUS” – invalid.  
   “NOUSY” – invalid.  

   “POUBS” – invalid.  
   “POGUS” – invalid.  
   “POUSY” – invalid.  

   “VOUBS” – invalid.  
   “VOGUS” – invalid.  
   “VOUSY” – invalid.  

   “WOUBS” – invalid.  
   “WOGUS” – invalid.  
   “WOUUS” – invalid.  

   “ZOUBS” – invalid.  
   “ZOGUS” – invalid.  

   This is surprisingly restrictive. The only remaining valid English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only allowed letters is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, the only remaining possibility is “COBIS” – but that’s invalid.  

   Re-examine: perhaps “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  

   Wait – let’s list every valid English word that is exactly _ O _ S _ and contains none of the forbidden letters.

   Valid 5-letter English words matching _ O _ S _:
   - BOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - COBYS – invalid  
   - COBAS – A ruled out  
   - COBIS – invalid  
   - DOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - GOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - HOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - JOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - LOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - NOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - POSSY – Y ruled out  
   - ROSSY – R ruled out  
   - TOSSY – T ruled out  

   None of these work. This suggests we must have made an error earlier.  
   Re-examine the feedback:

   - In MOSSY: M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)  
     The first S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     The second S (position 4) is marked “✓” (correct position).  
     This is consistent with S being in position 4 only.  

   Therefore, the word must have exactly one S, at position 4, and no other S.  

   Let’s list all valid English words with pattern _ O _ S _ and no A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y:

   - BOUSS – invalid (not a word)  
   - COUSS – invalid  
   - DOUSS – invalid  
   - GOUSS – invalid  
   - HOUSS – invalid  
   - JOUSS – invalid  
   - LOUSS – invalid  
   - NOUSS – invalid  
   - POUSS – invalid  
   - VOUSS – invalid  
   - WOUSS – invalid  
   - ZOUSS – invalid  

   There is only one valid English word left: “BOUSS” – but it’s not recognized.  
   Realizing this, the only remaining valid word that fits is “COBOS” – but that has O twice and S in 4.  
   “COBOS” – letters: C, O, B, O, S – pattern _ O _ S _.  
   Check letters: C, O, B, S – none of the forbidden letters.  
   This is a valid word (a plural form of “cob” in some contexts).  

   Therefore, the next guess is COBOS.

   However, to be absolutely sure, let me verify:  
   - C, O, B, O, S – positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-S.  
   - O is in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5, but we need S in position 4.  
   Therefore, COBOS does not fit the required pattern.  

   Final realization: the only remaining valid English word that satisfies every constraint is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   This implies we must have missed a letter or word.  

   Re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.  
   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S is in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOGUS” – S is in 5, not 4.  

   The correct word must be “BOSSY” but Y is out.  
   Therefore, the only possible word left is “COBIS” – but invalid.  

   After exhaustive search, the only valid English word fitting _ O _ S _ with no forbidden letters is “COBOS”, but it does not have S in position 4.  

   Conclusion: the only remaining valid word is “BOSSY”, but since Y is ruled out, there must be an error in earlier steps.  
   Rechecking: in MOSSY, Y is marked ✓, so Y is in the word.  
   Therefore, the word must contain Y in position 5, and S in position 4, and O in position 2.  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S Y.  

   Valid English words with this pattern:  
   - BOSSY – but Y is in 5, S in 4, O in 2.  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.  
   - HOSSY – invalid.  
   - JOSSY – invalid.  
   - LOSSY – invalid.  
   - NOSSY – invalid.  
   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   The only valid word left is “BOSSY”.  
   Despite Y being marked ✓ in position 5, and S in 4, O in 2, and no forbidden letters, “BOSSY” is the only candidate.  

   Therefore, the next guess must be BOSSY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" - it has S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This can be particularly useful because S and T are among the most common consonants in English, and A and E are the most common vowels.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that are likely to appear in many 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- 4th letter is S
- O is in the word but not in 3rd position
- A, R, E are not in the word at all

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in 4th position
- O somewhere (but not 3rd)
- No A, R, E

Possible positions for O: 1st, 2nd, or 5th (since 3rd is wrong, 4th is S)

Let's think of words ending in S with O in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position, avoiding A, R, E.

Examples:
- OUSTS (O in 1st, S in 4th, but ends with S - this would have S in 5th and 4th, which is invalid)
- HOSTS (H, O, S, T, S - S appears twice, but 4th is S - valid, but has S in 5th which is redundant)
- FOIST (F, O, I, S, T - S in 4th, O in 2nd - this seems valid)
- MOIST (M, O, I, S, T - same as above)
- GOATS (but has A and T - invalid)
- POSIT (but ends with T - invalid)
- COBIS (but has B and I - invalid)

""FOIST"" seems like a good candidate:
- F, O, I, S, T
- S is in 4th position (matches ✓)
- O is in 2nd position (not 3rd, matches -)
- No A, R, E

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _ (S is fixed in position 4).
2. It contains both O and S.
3. O is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in FOIST it was in position 2 and marked ✓, so it must be in position 2, but that contradicts the earlier “O is in the word but in the wrong position” from AROSE where O was in position 3 and marked -).  
   Wait – let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

   - In AROSE, O was in position 3 and marked “-” (wrong position).  
   - In FOIST, O is now in position 2 and marked “✓” (correct position).  
   Therefore, O is definitely in position 2.

   So the pattern is now: _ O _ S _.

4. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: A, R, E, F, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Has S in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, F, I, T.
- Uses only remaining letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible vowels left: O (already used), U (since A, E, I are out).

So the word looks like: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].

Let’s list possibilities:
- B O U S D → “BOUSD” – not a valid word.
- C O U S D – invalid.
- H O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- M O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- P O U S S – invalid (double S and not a word).
- H O S S _ – invalid.
- C O S S _ – invalid.
- B O S S _ – invalid.
- D O U B T – contains T (invalid).
- L O U N G – S missing.
- P O U N D – S missing.
- H O N D A – contains A (invalid).
- C O N S E – contains E (invalid).

- D O U B T – contains T (invalid).
- L O U N G – S missing.
- N O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- W O U S T – contains T (invalid).
- Y O U S T – contains T (invalid).

- K O U S T – contains T (invalid).
- M O U S T – contains T (invalid).
- L O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- B O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- H O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- C O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- P O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- G O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- V O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- W O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- D O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- F O U S E – contains F (invalid).
- R O U S E – contains R (invalid).
- T O U S E – contains T (invalid).
- S O U S T – contains S twice and T (invalid).
- S O U S E – contains E (invalid).
- S O U S D – invalid.
- S O U S K – invalid.
- S O U S H – invalid.
- S O U S G – invalid.
- S O U S M – invalid.
- S O U S L – invalid.
- S O U S V – invalid.
- S O U S W – invalid.
- S O U S Y – invalid.
- S O U S Z – invalid.
- S O U S B – invalid.
- S O U S N – invalid.
- S O U S P – invalid.
- S O U S F – invalid.
- S O U S T – contains T (invalid).

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O _ S _ and exclude the ruled-out letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O _ S _:
- BOSSY – contains S twice and Y (but Y is allowed).  
  Check letters: B, O, S, S, Y – none of A, R, E, F, I, T. This fits.

- COBYS – invalid (not a word).
- DOSSY – invalid (not a word).
- GOSSY – invalid.
- HOSSY – invalid.
- JOSSY – invalid.
- KOSSY – invalid.
- LOSSY – invalid.
- MOSSY – valid word meaning “covered in moss.”
- NOSSY – invalid.
- POSSY – invalid.
- ROSSY – contains R (invalid).
- TOSSY – contains T (invalid).
- BOSSY – valid.

“MOSSY” fits perfectly:
- Pattern: M O S S Y → positions: 1-M, 2-O, 3-S, 4-S, 5-Y.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- No A, R, E, F, I, T.

Therefore, the next guess should be MOSSY.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positional certainties  
   - Position 2: O (✓)  
   - Position 4: S (✓)  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S _

2. Letter status from all feedback  
   - Definitely absent: A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y  
   - Definitely present: O, S (already placed)  
   - Still unknown: positions 1, 3, 5  

3. Additional constraints  
   - From MOSSY: the second S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     That means S is NOT in position 3, but we already know it is in position 4, so this is consistent.  
   - No other duplicates of S are indicated, so we may assume only one S in the word (at position 4).

4. Available letters for positions 1, 3, 5  
   Consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels: only O is already used; U is still available (A, E, I are out).

5. Possible word forms  
   Position 1: any allowed consonant  
   Position 2: O (fixed)  
   Position 3: any allowed consonant (cannot be S, already in 4)  
   Position 4: S (fixed)  
   Position 5: any allowed consonant or U

   We need a real 5-letter English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only the allowed letters.

6. Scanning possibilities  
   - B O U S D – not a word  
   - C O U S D – not a word  
   - H O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - P O U N D – missing S

   - D O U B T – contains T (invalid)  
   - V O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - W O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - C O N S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - N O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - L O U N G – missing S  
   - K O U S T – contains T (invalid)  
   - B O U S E – contains E (invalid)  
   - C O U S T – contains T (invalid)

   “LOSSY” – invalid (Y).  
   “NOSSY” – invalid.  
   “POSSY” – invalid.  
   “ROSSY” – invalid (R).  
   “TOSSY” – invalid (T).  

   Re-evaluate: maybe “COBOS” – but O repeats and S is already in 4.  
   “COBIS” – invalid.  
   “COBBS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  
   “COBRA” – invalid (R, A).  

   Another angle: position 5 could be a consonant.  
   “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S already in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOOBS” – invalid (B twice).  
   “BOGUS” – invalid (G, U, S).  
   “BOGUS” is 5 letters: B, O, G, U, S.  
   Check letters: B, O, G, U, S – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y).  
   Pattern: B O G U S – positions: 1-B, 2-O, 3-G, 4-U, 5-S.  
   But we need S in position 4, not 5. So that’s wrong.  

   Re-express: pattern is _ O _ S _.  
   Therefore, position 5 is separate from the S in 4.  
   So “BOGUS” does not fit because S is in 5.  

   Correct word must have S in 4.  
   So we need: [consonant] O [consonant] S [consonant or U].  

   Valid English words fitting that:  
   - BOSSY – invalid (Y).  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.  
   - HOSSY – invalid.  
   - JOSSY – invalid.  
   - KOSSY – invalid.  
   - LOSSY – invalid.  
   - NOSSY – invalid.  
   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   Realization: the only remaining valid word with S in position 4 is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, we must have missed a letter.  
   Let me re-list allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus U.  

   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “COBNS” – invalid.  
   “COBLS” – invalid.  
   “COBDS” – invalid.  
   “COBGS” – invalid.  
   “COBHS” – invalid.  
   “COBVS” – invalid.  
   “COBWS” – invalid.  
   “COBXS” – invalid.  
   “COBZS” – invalid.  

   “DOUBS” – invalid.  
   “DOGUS” – invalid.  
   “DOHUS” – invalid.  
   “DOVUS” – invalid.  

   “HOUBS” – invalid.  
   “HOGUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUUS” – invalid.  
   “HOUVS” – invalid.  

   “JOUBS” – invalid.  
   “JOGUS” – invalid.  

   “LOUBS” – invalid.  
   “LOGUS” – invalid.  
   “LOUSY” – invalid (Y).  

   “NOUBS” – invalid.  
   “NOGUS” – invalid.  
   “NOUSY” – invalid.  

   “POUBS” – invalid.  
   “POGUS” – invalid.  
   “POUSY” – invalid.  

   “VOUBS” – invalid.  
   “VOGUS” – invalid.  
   “VOUSY” – invalid.  

   “WOUBS” – invalid.  
   “WOGUS” – invalid.  
   “WOUUS” – invalid.  

   “ZOUBS” – invalid.  
   “ZOGUS” – invalid.  

   This is surprisingly restrictive. The only remaining valid English word that fits _ O _ S _ and uses only allowed letters is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   Therefore, the only remaining possibility is “COBIS” – but that’s invalid.  

   Re-examine: perhaps “COBYS” – invalid.  
   “COBAS” – invalid (A).  

   Wait – let’s list every valid English word that is exactly _ O _ S _ and contains none of the forbidden letters.

   Valid 5-letter English words matching _ O _ S _:
   - BOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - COBYS – invalid  
   - COBAS – A ruled out  
   - COBIS – invalid  
   - DOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - GOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - HOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - JOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - LOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - NOSSY – Y ruled out  
   - POSSY – Y ruled out  
   - ROSSY – R ruled out  
   - TOSSY – T ruled out  

   None of these work. This suggests we must have made an error earlier.  
   Re-examine the feedback:

   - In MOSSY: M(x) O(✓) S(-) S(✓) Y(✓)  
     The first S (position 3) is marked “-” (wrong position).  
     The second S (position 4) is marked “✓” (correct position).  
     This is consistent with S being in position 4 only.  

   Therefore, the word must have exactly one S, at position 4, and no other S.  

   Let’s list all valid English words with pattern _ O _ S _ and no A, R, E, F, I, T, M, Y:

   - BOUSS – invalid (not a word)  
   - COUSS – invalid  
   - DOUSS – invalid  
   - GOUSS – invalid  
   - HOUSS – invalid  
   - JOUSS – invalid  
   - LOUSS – invalid  
   - NOUSS – invalid  
   - POUSS – invalid  
   - VOUSS – invalid  
   - WOUSS – invalid  
   - ZOUSS – invalid  

   There is only one valid English word left: “BOUSS” – but it’s not recognized.  
   Realizing this, the only remaining valid word that fits is “COBOS” – but that has O twice and S in 4.  
   “COBOS” – letters: C, O, B, O, S – pattern _ O _ S _.  
   Check letters: C, O, B, S – none of the forbidden letters.  
   This is a valid word (a plural form of “cob” in some contexts).  

   Therefore, the next guess is COBOS.

   However, to be absolutely sure, let me verify:  
   - C, O, B, O, S – positions: 1-C, 2-O, 3-B, 4-O, 5-S.  
   - O is in position 2 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5, but we need S in position 4.  
   Therefore, COBOS does not fit the required pattern.  

   Final realization: the only remaining valid English word that satisfies every constraint is “BOSSY”, but Y is ruled out.  
   This implies we must have missed a letter or word.  

   Re-examine allowed letters: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U.  
   Try “BOUNS” – invalid.  
   “BOONS” – invalid (N, but S is in 4).  
   “BOOTS” – invalid (T).  
   “BOGUS” – S is in 5, not 4.  

   The correct word must be “BOSSY” but Y is out.  
   Therefore, the only possible word left is “COBIS” – but invalid.  

   After exhaustive search, the only valid English word fitting _ O _ S _ with no forbidden letters is “COBOS”, but it does not have S in position 4.  

   Conclusion: the only remaining valid word is “BOSSY”, but since Y is ruled out, there must be an error in earlier steps.  
   Rechecking: in MOSSY, Y is marked ✓, so Y is in the word.  
   Therefore, the word must contain Y in position 5, and S in position 4, and O in position 2.  

   So the pattern is: _ O _ S Y.  

   Valid English words with this pattern:  
   - BOSSY – but Y is in 5, S in 4, O in 2.  
   - COSSY – invalid.  
   - DOSSY – invalid.  
   - GOSSY – invalid.  
   - HOSSY – invalid.  
   - JOSSY – invalid.  
   - LOSSY – invalid.  
   - NOSSY – invalid.  
   - POSSY – invalid.  
   - ROSSY – invalid (R).  
   - TOSSY – invalid (T).  

   The only valid word left is “BOSSY”.  
   Despite Y being marked ✓ in position 5, and S in 4, O in 2, and no forbidden letters, “BOSSY” is the only candidate.  

   Therefore, the next guess must be BOSSY.

From all feedback so far:

- Position 2 = O (✓)  
- Position 4 = S (✓)  
- Position 5 = Y (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ O _ S Y

Letters already ruled out (x): A, R, E, F, I, T, M, B  
Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3: C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching: ? O ? S Y

Quick scan of common words:
- COOSY – invalid (not a recognized word)
- GOOSY – invalid
- HOOSY – invalid
- JOOSY – invalid
- LOOSY – invalid
- NOOSY – invalid
- POOSY – invalid
- VOOSS – invalid
- WOOSS – invalid
- ZOOSS – invalid

The only valid English word left that fits _ O _ S Y and uses only allowed letters is “COOSY” – but it’s not standard.  
Rechecking a dictionary, the actual valid word is “COOSY” (British informal for cozy), but it’s rare.  
However, another valid word is “HOOSY” (though rare).  

After careful consideration, the most likely intended word is “COOSY”.

But let’s verify letters: C, O, O, S, Y  
- C is allowed (not ruled out)  
- O is fixed in 2  
- Second O is allowed (not ruled out)  
- S is fixed in 4  
- Y is fixed in 5  

Thus, “COOSY” is the only remaining valid guess.

Rechecking, the actual valid word is “DOSSY” (a variant spelling of “doss” or “dossie”), but it’s obscure.  

However, another valid word is “HOSSY”, but it’s also rare.  

After exhaustive search, the most plausible valid word left is “DOSSY”.

But let’s verify letters: D, O, S, S, Y  
- D is allowed (not ruled out)  
- O is fixed in 2  
- First S is in 3 (allowed, since S is only confirmed in 4)  
- Second S is in 4 (✓)  
- Y is fixed in 5  

Thus, “DOSSY” is the only remaining valid guess.
