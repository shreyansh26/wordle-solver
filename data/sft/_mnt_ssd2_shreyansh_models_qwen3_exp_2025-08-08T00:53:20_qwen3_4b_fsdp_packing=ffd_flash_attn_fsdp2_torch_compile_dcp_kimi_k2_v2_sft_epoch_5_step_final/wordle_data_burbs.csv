For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, I, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): R and S.
3. Position constraints:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

Therefore:
- The word must contain R and S exactly once each (since we haven’t seen duplicates).
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- S can only be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4).

We still need to test other common letters: C, L, N, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, etc.

- Place R and S in new allowable positions.
- Introduce as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, O, E, T, I, P).

Let’s try “CRUSH”:
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2) → invalid.

- S (position 1, allowed)
- T (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- R (position 4, allowed)
- P (new letter)

STIRP avoids A, O, E, and positions R and S differently.  
Let’s go with STIRP.

Guess 2: STIRP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) R(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, I, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): R and S.
3. Position constraints:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

Therefore:
- The word must contain R and S exactly once each (since we haven’t seen duplicates).
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- S can only be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4).

We still need to test other common letters: C, L, N, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, etc.  
A good next guess should:
- Place R and S in new allowable positions.
- Introduce as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, O, E, T, I, P).

Let’s try “CRUSH”:
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2) → invalid.

Try “DRUNK”:
- D (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid) → no.

Try “BURNS”:
- B (new)
- U (new vowel)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- N (new)
- S (position 5 – allowed)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R and S.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B, U, N (all new and common).
- No eliminated letters.

So “BURNS” is a valid next guess.

Known letters NOT in the word:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, O, or E.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S (and possibly other common letters).
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and introduces new common letters.  
“TRIPS” comes to mind:
- T (common consonant)
- R (must be in a new position, e.g., 2nd)
- I (common vowel)
- P (common consonant)
- S (must be in a new position, e.g., 5th)

Check positions:
- R is in position 2 in TRIPS, but feedback said R is not in position 2. So TRIPS is invalid.

Next try: “FRISK”
- F (new letter)
- R (position 2 again – invalid)

Next try: “STIRP”
- S (position 1, allowed)
- T (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- R (position 4, allowed)
- P (new letter)

STIRP avoids A, O, E, and positions R and S differently.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me gather information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) – R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but not A, O, or E.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses R and S (and possibly other common letters).
2. Avoids A, O, E.
3. Avoids R in position 2 and S in position 4.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and introduces new common letters.  
“TRIPS” comes to mind:
- T (common consonant)
- R (must be in a new position, e.g., 2nd)
- I (common vowel)
- P (common consonant)
- S (must be in a new position, e.g., 5th)

Check positions:
- R is in position 2 in TRIPS, but feedback said R is not in position 2. So TRIPS is invalid.

Next try: “FRISK”
- F (new letter)
- R (position 2 again – invalid)

Next try: “STIRP”
- S (position 1, allowed)
- T (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- R (position 4, allowed)
- P (new letter)

STIRP avoids A, O, E, and positions R and S differently.  
Let’s go with STIRP.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STIRP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) R(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, I, P.
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): R and S.
3. Position constraints:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
   - S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

Therefore:
- The word must contain R and S exactly once each (since we haven’t seen duplicates).
- R can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- S can only be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4).

We still need to test other common letters: C, L, N, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, etc.  
A good next guess should:
- Place R and S in new allowable positions.
- Introduce as many new common consonants and vowels as possible.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, O, E, T, I, P).

Let’s try “CRUSH”:
- C (new letter)
- R (position 2 – but feedback says R is not in position 2) → invalid.

Try “DRUNK”:
- D (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid) → no.

Try “BURNS”:
- B (new)
- U (new vowel)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- N (new)
- S (position 5 – allowed)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R and S.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Introduces B, U, N (all new and common).
- No eliminated letters.

So “BURNS” is a valid next guess.

Guess 3: BURNS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) R(✓) N(x) S(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Known letters in the word and their positions:
- B in position 1 (✓)
- U in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)

Known letters NOT in the word:
A, O, E, T, I, P, N

So the word has the pattern:
B U R _ S

We need a single letter for the 4th position that hasn't been eliminated yet and makes a valid 5-letter English word.

Common remaining consonants (not yet eliminated): C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking at the pattern BUR_S, possible letters for the 4th position:
- C → BURCS (invalid, not a word)
- D → BURDS (invalid)
- F → BURFS (invalid)
- G → BURGS (valid word, ""BURGS"")
- H → BURHS (invalid)
- K → BURKS (invalid)
- L → BURLS (invalid)
- M → BURMS (invalid)
- Y → BURYS (invalid)

The only valid word from these is ""BURGS"".

Let's verify:
- B, U, R, G, S
- G hasn't been eliminated (not in the banned list)
- Forms the valid word ""BURGS""

Therefore, the next guess is BURGS.
