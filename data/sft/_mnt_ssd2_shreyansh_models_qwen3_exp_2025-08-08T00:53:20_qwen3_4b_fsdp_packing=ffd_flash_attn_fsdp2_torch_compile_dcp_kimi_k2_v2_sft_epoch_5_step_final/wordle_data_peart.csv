### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to identify potential letters in the secret word.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but all still in unknown positions):
- A (cannot be 1st or 2nd)
- R (cannot be 2nd or 3rd)
- E (cannot be 1st or 5th)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
A: not 1, not 2  
R: not 2, not 3  
E: not 1, not 5  

We still need to test the remaining common consonants (T, N, I, C, etc.) and the vowel I (since we’ve only confirmed A and E so far). A good next word should:
1. Use A, R, E in positions they haven’t been tried yet.
2. Introduce new, still-untested common letters.
3. Avoid O, S, L, Y.

Possible placements:
- A has only positions 3, 4, 5 left.
- R has only positions 1, 4, 5 left.
- E has only positions 2, 3, 4 left.

Let’s try to place them in fresh spots while adding new consonants. A word like “TIARA” would reuse A and R but also test T and I; however, it repeats A twice and might waste a letter. Instead, “TRAIN” is better: it places A in position 3 (new), R in position 1 (new), and introduces T and N while keeping E out (since we need to test E somewhere). But we still haven’t tested E in any position, and E must appear. So we need a word that contains A, R, E all in new positions.

A good candidate is “TREAD”:
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of 2 and 3; here it’s in 2, but wait – in EARLY, R was in 3 and got “-”, so 3 is ruled out, but 2 was only ruled out in AROSE (R was in 2 and got “-”). So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Thus TREAD is invalid because R would be in 2 again.

Next candidate: “CRANE” – but we already considered this and it re-uses E in 5th, which is ruled out. Also contains N and C.

Another candidate: “RATIO” – but contains O (ruled out).

“REACT”:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- C and T are new letters
Positions:
- R: 1 (allowed)
- E: 2 (allowed)

No conflicts with previous feedback.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to identify potential letters in the secret word.

A: not 1, not 2  
R: not 2, not 3  
E: not 1, not 5  

We still need to test the remaining common consonants (T, N, I, C, etc.) and the vowel I (since we’ve only confirmed A and E so far). A good next word should:
1. Use A, R, E in positions they haven’t been tried yet.
2. Introduce new, still-untested common letters.
3. Avoid O, S, L, Y.

Possible placements:
- A has only positions 3, 4, 5 left.
- R has only positions 1, 4, 5 left.
- E has only positions 2, 3, 4 left.

Let’s try to place them in fresh spots while adding new consonants. A word like “TIARA” would reuse A and R but also test T and I; however, it repeats A twice and might waste a letter. Instead, “TRAIN” is better: it places A in position 3 (new), R in position 1 (new), and introduces T and N while keeping E out (since we need to test E somewhere). But we still haven’t tested E in any position, and E must appear. So we need a word that contains A, R, E all in new positions.

A good candidate is “TREAD”:
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of 2 and 3; here it’s in 2, but wait – in EARLY, R was in 3 and got “-”, so 3 is ruled out, but 2 was only ruled out in AROSE (R was in 2 and got “-”). So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Thus TREAD is invalid because R would be in 2 again.

Next candidate: “CRANE” – but we already considered this and it re-uses E in 5th, which is ruled out. Also contains N and C.

Another candidate: “RATIO” – but contains O (ruled out).

“REACT”:
- R in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- C and T are new letters
Positions:
- R: 1 (allowed)
- E: 2 (allowed)
- A: 3 (allowed)
No conflicts with previous feedback.

This seems optimal.

From the three guesses we now have:

Known letters in the word (and their correct positions):
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 5 (✓)

Known letters NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, Y, C

Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 4
Remaining letters to test (common ones not yet ruled out): R, I, N, D, G, H, etc.

But we also know:
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and EARLY feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are already taken by E and A, R must be in position 1 or 4.
- However, position 4 is still open, so R could be there.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2
- Has A in position 3
- Has T in position 5
- Uses R in position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, L, Y, C)

Possible structure: _ E A _ T

Testing R in position 1: R E A _ T → ""REA_T""
Testing R in position 4: _ E A R T → ""__A_R_T"" (but then position 1 and 4 would need letters, and position 4 is already R)

Looking at valid words:
- ""REACT"" was already tried (C is out)
- ""READT"" is not a word
- ""REALT"" is not a word
- ""REBUT"" - but B and U are new, and position 4 would be B, not R
- ""REACT"" already used
- ""REHAB"" - but position 5 must be T
- ""REACT"" already used

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ E A _ T with letters not ruled out.

Letters left: R, I, N, D, G, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ""HEART"" - H in 1, E in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5. This fits all constraints: H, E, A, R, T. None of these letters are ruled out except R is confirmed in word but position 4 hasn't been ruled out for R (only positions 2 and 3 were ruled out for R). So R in position 4 is allowed.

This seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback:
- E is locked in position 2
- A is locked in position 3
- T is locked in position 5
- R must appear somewhere (from earlier feedback) and can now only be in position 1 or 4
- The word must be _ E A _ T

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices for first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E

I think ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to identify potential letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O is NOT in the word
- S is NOT in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth)

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be 1st
  – R cannot be 2nd
  – E cannot be 5th

Next guess should:
1. Re-use A, R, E in new positions
2. Avoid O, S entirely
3. Introduce new common letters to test

Good candidates:
- REACT (R1, E2, A3, C4, T5) – but T might be too common
- RATIO – contains O (already ruled out)
- CRAVE – contains C, V (but S is already ruled out)
- TAROT – contains O (ruled out)
- CRANE – contains C, N, E, but S is already ruled out
- EAGER – contains E twice (but E is already confirmed)
- EARLY – contains E, A, R plus L, Y

""EARLY"" looks best:
- Places A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces L and Y to test new letters
- No O or S used

Avoid O, S, L, Y.\n\nPossible placements:\n- A has only positions 3, 4, 5 left.\n- R has only positions 1, 4, 5 left.\n- E has only positions 2, 3, 4 left.\n\nLet’s try to place them in fresh spots while adding new consonants. A word like “TIARA” would reuse A and R but also test T and I; however, it repeats A twice and might waste a letter. Instead, “TRAIN” is better: it places A in position 3 (new), R in position 1 (new), and introduces T and N while keeping E out (since we need to test E somewhere). But we still haven’t tested E in any position, and E must appear. So we need a word that contains A, R, E all in new positions.\n\nA good candidate is “TREAD”:\n- T (new letter)\n- R in position 2 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of 2 and 3; here it’s in 2, but wait – in EARLY, R was in 3 and got “-”, so 3 is ruled out, but 2 was only ruled out in AROSE (R was in 2 and got “-”). So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Thus TREAD is invalid because R would be in 2 again.\n\nNext candidate: “CRANE” – but we already considered this and it re-uses E in 5th, which is ruled out. Also contains N and C.\n\nAnother candidate: “RATIO” – but contains O (ruled out).\n\n“REACT”:\n- R in 1 (allowed)\n- E in 2 (allowed)\n- A in 3 (allowed)\n- C and T are new letters\nPositions:\n- R: 1 (allowed)\n- E: 2 (allowed)\n- A: 3 (allowed)\nNo conflicts with previous feedback.\n\nThis seems optimal.\n\n<guess>REACT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(✓) A(✓) C(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the three guesses we now have:\n\nKnown letters in the word (and their correct positions):\n- E is in position 2 (✓)\n- A is in position 3 (✓)\n- T is in position 5 (✓)\n\nKnown letters NOT in the word:\n- O, S, L, Y, C\n\nRemaining positions to fill: 1 and 4\nRemaining letters to test (common ones not yet ruled out): R, I, N, D, G, H, etc.\n\nBut we also know:\n- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and EARLY feedback). Since positions 2 and 3 are already taken by E and A, R must be in position 1 or 4.\n- However, position 4 is still open, so R could be there.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Has E in position 2\n- Has A in position 3\n- Has T in position 5\n- Uses R in position 1 or 4\n- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no O, S, L, Y, C)\n\nPossible structure: _ E A _ T\n\nTesting R in position 1: R E A _ T → ""REA_T""\nTesting R in position 4: _ E A R T → ""__A_R_T"" (but then position 1 and 4 would need letters, and position 4 is already R)\n\nLooking at valid words:\n- ""REACT"" was already tried (C is out)\n- ""READT"" is not a word\n- ""REALT"" is not a word\n- ""REBUT"" - but B and U are new, and position 4 would be B, not R\n- ""REACT"" already used\n- ""REHAB"" - but position 5 must be T\n- ""REACT"" already used\n\nWait, let\'s think differently: the word must be _ E A _ T with letters not ruled out.\n\nLetters left: R, I, N, D, G, H, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""HEART"" - H in 1, E in 2, A in 3, R in 4, T in 5.

From the four guesses we now have the exact word:

Positions:
1: must be a letter not yet ruled out (cannot be H, O, S, L, Y, C)
2: E (✓)
3: A (✓)
4: R (✓)
5: T (✓)

So the pattern is: _ E A R T

Letters still allowed for position 1 (from the alphabet minus all eliminated letters):
Allowed so far: A, B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but A, E, R, T are already used in other positions).

Looking for common English 5-letter words ending in EART:
The only common word is ""BEART"" (but not valid), ""DEART"" (not valid), ""FEART"" (not valid), ""PEART"" (valid variant), ""SEART"" (not valid), ""WEART"" (not valid).

However, ""PEAR"" is 4 letters, and ""PEAR"" + ""T"" = ""PEART"" which is a valid word (though rare). The most common valid word fitting _ E A R T is actually ""BEART"" which is not recognized. 

Upon checking, the valid word is ""BEART"" which is considered archaic or dialectal for ""bearet"" (not standard). The standard word is ""PEAR"" but that's 4 letters.

Realizing that, the correct and standard word fitting _ E A R T is actually ""PEART"" (a valid Scrabble word meaning a type of fish or pearl). 

But let's verify: P is not ruled out, E is position 2, A is 3, R is 4, T is 5. No conflicts.

Thus, the word must be PEART.
