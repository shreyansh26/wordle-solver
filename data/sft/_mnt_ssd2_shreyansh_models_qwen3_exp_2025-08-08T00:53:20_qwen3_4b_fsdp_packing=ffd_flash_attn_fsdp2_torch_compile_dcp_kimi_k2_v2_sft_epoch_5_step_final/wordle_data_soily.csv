### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Good coverage of the alphabet

This should provide good information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, E.
- DOES contain O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O and S.
2. Does NOT include A, R, E.
3. Places O and S in different positions than before.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (was in 3)
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (was in 4)

I’ll pick a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters to test. The word “SOLID” fits:
- S (now in position 1, was 4) ✓
- O (now in position 2, was 3) ✓
- Does NOT contain A, R, E ✓
- Introduces new letters L, I, D to test.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

   – O and S are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

2. SOLID → S(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) D(x)

   – O is now fixed in position 2.  
   – L and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
   – D is out.

So far we know:
- Pattern so far: S O _ _ _  
- Letters still needed: L and I must appear somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 3, 4, 5), but not where they just were (L ≠ 3, I ≠ 4).  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, D.

Let’s list possible placements of L and I that satisfy the constraints and then pick a valid 5-letter word.

Possible positions for L: 2, 4, 5 (but 2 is already O, so 4 or 5)  
Possible positions for I: 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is O, so 3 or 5)

We need to place L and I plus one more letter (not any of the excluded ones).  
A good candidate is “SOILY”:

- I in position 3 (allowed)  
- Y is a new letter to test.
