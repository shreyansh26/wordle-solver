### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses.

From both guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
- A – cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- R – cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- O – cannot be in positions 3 or 5

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- S, E, D, I

So the secret word must contain A, R, O exactly once each, and two additional letters that are not S, E, D, I.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible remaining vowels: none left (only A and O are still possible, and both are already confirmed in the word).

We need to place A, R, O in positions they haven’t occupied yet and fill the remaining two slots with new letters.

Good candidate placements:
- A must go in positions 3, 4, or 5
- R must go in positions 3, 4, or 5 (and not next to A if we want to test new consonants)
- O must go in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)

Let’s try a word that satisfies all constraints and introduces two new consonants: CRANK
- C and N are new letters
- R is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is not used, so we’ll test new positions for O in a later guess if needed

- C and K are not in the word.

- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, O, N (N is fixed at position 4).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, D, I, C, K.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and CRANK).
  – R cannot be in 1, 2, or 5 (from AROSE, RADIO, CRANK).
  – O cannot be in 3 or 5 (from AROSE, RADIO).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already N, so A must be in position 5.
- R must be in position 3 or 4. Position 4 is N, so R must be in position 3.
- O must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 3,4,5).

We now have:
_ _ R N A
with O in position 1 or 2.

Possible words:
- O _ R N A → ORRNA (invalid, not a word)
- _ O R N A → ?ORN A → “TORNA” (not a word), “FORNA” (not), “MORNA” (valid word variant but obscure), “HORNA” (no).

Wait, we missed that position 2 could be any valid letter not yet eliminated. Let’s list valid English words fitting:
- Pattern: ? ? R N A with A at 5, R at 3, N at 4, and containing O somewhere in 1 or 2.

Valid English word: M O R N A → “MORNA” is a word (Scottish term, accepted in Scrabble/Wordle dictionaries).

Check constraints:
- Contains A, R, O, N.
- N is at position 4 (✓).
- A is at position 5 (allowed).
- R is at position 3 (allowed).
- O is at position 2 (allowed).
- No S, E, D, I, C, K.

Hence, MORNA is a valid next guess.

<guess>MORNA</guess>",MORNA,"From the new feedback on CRANK:
- C and K are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R, O, N (N is fixed at position 4).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, D, I, C, K.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and CRANK).
  – R cannot be in 1, 2, or 5 (from AROSE, RADIO, CRANK).
  – O cannot be in 3 or 5 (from AROSE, RADIO).

Therefore:
- A must be in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is already N, so A must be in position 5.
- R must be in position 3 or 4. Position 4 is N, so R must be in position 3.
- O must be in position 1 or 2 (cannot be 3,4,5).

We now have:
_ _ R N A
