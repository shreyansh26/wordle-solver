For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Excludes R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _ or _ _ _ A _ or _ _ _ _ A.

A strong next guess would cover new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 2.
- It uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option is ""PAINT"" or ""FAINT"", but ""TAINT"" seems slightly more common. I'll go with ""TAINT"".

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  
Known positions:  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from TAINT: A(✓)).  
- I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  
with the additional constraints that I and N must appear somewhere else in the word (not in positions 3 and 4 respectively), and no R, O, S, E, T are allowed.

Remaining letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and N, and we have three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) but I can’t be in 3 and N can’t be in 4.  
A promising pattern is:  
_ A I N _ or _ A N I _ or _ A _ I N or _ A _ N I, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
- Position 1: Could be D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y  
- Position 2: A (fixed)  
- Position 3: Could be I (but then N can’t be in 4)  
- Position 4: Could be N (but then I can’t be in 3)  
- Position 5: Could be another letter.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:
- C (new letter)  
- A (correct position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3, since the feedback only said I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3; here it’s position 3 again but that’s allowed because the feedback was “I(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3 of TAINT, so position 3 is fine for I)  
- N (allowed in position 4, since the feedback was “N(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 4 of TAINT, so position 4 is fine)  
- H (new letter)

But wait, in TAINT, position 4 was N with feedback “N(-)”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4. So “CHAIN” is invalid because it places N in position 4.

Let me rethink. We need N somewhere not in position 4, and I somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ A I _ N (I in 3, N in 5) – but I can’t be in 3 (since TAINT had I in 3 with “-” feedback, meaning I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3, so I can be in 3 here, but it’s safer to move I elsewhere)
- _ A _ I N (N in 5, I in 4) – this works because N isn’t in 4 and I isn’t in 3
- _ A N _ I (N in 3, I in 5) – but N can’t be in 4, so 3 is fine
- _ A _ N I (N in 4 – invalid, same as above)

The best safe pattern seems _ A _ I N or _ A N _ I.

Let’s try “PAIN_” – but we need 5 letters. “PAINS” has S (excluded).  
“PAINT” was already tried.  
“FAINT” – F is new, but T is excluded.  
“GAINT” – G is new, T is excluded.  
“HAINT” – H is new, T is excluded.  
“BAINS” – S excluded.  
“CAIN_” – need 5 letters: “CAIN_” – nothing common.  
“DAINS” – S excluded.  
“MAINS” – S excluded.  
“PAINS” – S excluded.  
“VAINT” – T excluded.  
“WAIST” – S, T excluded.  
“PAKIN” – K is new, but “PAKIN” isn’t a common word.  
“MABIN” – not common.  
“LABIN” – not common.  
“GABIN” – not common.  
“HABIN” – not common.  
“CABIN” – C, A, B, I, N – this is valid and common!  
Check constraints:
C (new), A (correct pos 2), B (new), I (pos 4), N (pos 5).  
- A is in pos 2 – ✓  
- I is in pos 4 – allowed (feedback said I is not in pos 3 of TAINT, so pos 4 is fine)  
- N is in pos 5 – allowed (feedback said N is not in pos 4 of TAINT, so pos 5 is fine)  
- No R, O, S, E, T – ✓  
- All letters unique – good for info.

So “CABIN” is a strong next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Excludes R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _ or _ _ _ A _ or _ _ _ _ A.

A strong next guess would cover new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 2.
- It uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option is ""PAINT"" or ""FAINT"", but ""TAINT"" seems slightly more common. I'll go with ""TAINT"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  
Known positions:  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from TAINT: A(✓)).  
- I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  
with the additional constraints that I and N must appear somewhere else in the word (not in positions 3 and 4 respectively), and no R, O, S, E, T are allowed.

Remaining letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and N, and we have three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) but I can’t be in 3 and N can’t be in 4.  
A promising pattern is:  
_ A I N _ or _ A N I _ or _ A _ I N or _ A _ N I, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
- Position 1: Could be D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y  
- Position 2: A (fixed)  
- Position 3: Could be I (but then N can’t be in 4)  
- Position 4: Could be N (but then I can’t be in 3)  
- Position 5: Could be another letter.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:
- C (new letter)  
- A (correct position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3, since the feedback only said I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3; here it’s position 3 again but that’s allowed because the feedback was “I(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3 of TAINT, so position 3 is fine for I)  
- N (allowed in position 4, since the feedback was “N(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 4 of TAINT, so position 4 is fine)  
- H (new letter)

But wait, in TAINT, position 4 was N with feedback “N(-)”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4. So “CHAIN” is invalid because it places N in position 4.

Let me rethink. We need N somewhere not in position 4, and I somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ A I _ N (I in 3, N in 5) – but I can’t be in 3 (since TAINT had I in 3 with “-” feedback, meaning I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3, so I can be in 3 here, but it’s safer to move I elsewhere)
- _ A _ I N (N in 5, I in 4) – this works because N isn’t in 4 and I isn’t in 3
- _ A N _ I (N in 3, I in 5) – but N can’t be in 4, so 3 is fine
- _ A _ N I (N in 4 – invalid, same as above)

The best safe pattern seems _ A _ I N or _ A N _ I.

Let’s try “PAIN_” – but we need 5 letters. “PAINS” has S (excluded).  
“PAINT” was already tried.  
“FAINT” – F is new, but T is excluded.  
“GAINT” – G is new, T is excluded.  
“HAINT” – H is new, T is excluded.  
“BAINS” – S excluded.  
“CAIN_” – need 5 letters: “CAIN_” – nothing common.  
“DAINS” – S excluded.  
“MAINS” – S excluded.  
“PAINS” – S excluded.  
“VAINT” – T excluded.  
“WAIST” – S, T excluded.  
“PAKIN” – K is new, but “PAKIN” isn’t a common word.  
“MABIN” – not common.  
“LABIN” – not common.  
“GABIN” – not common.  
“HABIN” – not common.  
“CABIN” – C, A, B, I, N – this is valid and common!  
Check constraints:
C (new), A (correct pos 2), B (new), I (pos 4), N (pos 5).  
- A is in pos 2 – ✓  
- I is in pos 4 – allowed (feedback said I is not in pos 3 of TAINT, so pos 4 is fine)  
- N is in pos 5 – allowed (feedback said N is not in pos 4 of TAINT, so pos 5 is fine)  
- No R, O, S, E, T – ✓  
- All letters unique – good for info.

So “CABIN” is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, C, B  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  

Known positions:

- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from TAINT) or 4 (from CABIN).  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 (from TAINT) or 5 (from CABIN).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ _ _
with I and N still to place, and they must go in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) while respecting the exclusions.

Allowed positions:
- I cannot be in 3 or 4 → I must be in position 1 or 5.

None of the above combinations form a valid English 5-letter word. This suggests we might need to revisit the placement assumptions.

Alternative approach: Maybe I and N can both be in position 1, but that would require two I’s or N’s, which isn’t allowed.

Wait, let’s list all possible valid English 5-letter words that fit the constraints:
- Must have A in position 2.
- Must contain I and N exactly once each.
- Must not contain R, O, S, E, T, C, B.
- Must not have I in 3 or 4, N in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1 or 3  

Case 1: I in 1, N in 3  
Word: I A N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) without repeats.  
Real word: “IAND_” – nothing.  
“IANK_” – nothing.  
“IANL_” – nothing.  
“IANM_” – nothing.  
“IANP_” – nothing.  
“IANU_” – nothing.  
“IANV_” – nothing.  
“IANW_” – nothing.  
“IANY_” – nothing.  
“IANG_” – “IANG_” – not a word.  
“IANF_” – “IANF_” – not a word.  
“IANJ_” – not a word.  
So no valid word here.

Case 2: N in 1, I in 5  
Word: N A _ _ I  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining pool.  
Valid English word: “NADLI” – no.  
“NAKLI” – no.  
“NALMI” – no.  
“NAPLI” – no.  
“NAULI” – yes! “NAULI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of water container in India).

Check constraints:
- N A U L I  
- A is in position 2 – ✓  
- Contains I in position 5 (allowed) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 1 (allowed) – ✓  
- No R, O, S, E, T, C, B – ✓

Therefore, “NAULI” is a valid next guess.

- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from TAINT) or 4 (from CABIN).  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 (from TAINT) or 5 (from CABIN).

So the pattern is:

with I and N still to place, and they must go in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) while respecting the exclusions.

Allowed positions:
- I cannot be in 3 or 4 → I must be in position 1 or 5.

None of the above combinations form a valid English 5-letter word. This suggests we might need to revisit the placement assumptions.

Alternative approach: Maybe I and N can both be in position 1, but that would require two I’s or N’s, which isn’t allowed.

Wait, let’s list all possible valid English 5-letter words that fit the constraints:
- Must have A in position 2.
- Must contain I and N exactly once each.
- Must not contain R, O, S, E, T, C, B.
- Must not have I in 3 or 4, N in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1 or 3  

Case 1: I in 1, N in 3  
Word: I A N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) without repeats.  
Real word: “IAND_” – nothing.  
“IANK_” – nothing.  
“IANL_” – nothing.  
“IANM_” – nothing.  
“IANP_” – nothing.  
“IANU_” – nothing.  
“IANV_” – nothing.  
“IANW_” – nothing.  
“IANY_” – nothing.  
“IANG_” – “IANG_” – not a word.  
“IANF_” – “IANF_” – not a word.  
“IANJ_” – not a word.  
So no valid word here.

Case 2: N in 1, I in 5  
Word: N A _ _ I  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining pool.  
Valid English word: “NADLI” – no.  
“NAKLI” – no.  
“NALMI” – no.  
“NAPLI” – no.  
“NAULI” – yes! “NAULI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of water container in India).

Check constraints:
- N A U L I  
- A is in position 2 – ✓  
- Contains I in position 5 (allowed) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 1 (allowed) – ✓  
- No R, O, S, E, T, C, B – ✓  
- Letters U, L are new and allowed – ✓  

Therefore, “NAULI” is a valid next guess.",Guess 4: NAULI -> FEEDBACK: N(-) A(✓) U(x) L(x) I(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Excludes R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _ or _ _ _ A _ or _ _ _ _ A.

A strong next guess would cover new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 2.
- It uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option is ""PAINT"" or ""FAINT"", but ""TAINT"" seems slightly more common. I'll go with ""TAINT"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  
Known positions:  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from TAINT: A(✓)).  
- I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  
with the additional constraints that I and N must appear somewhere else in the word (not in positions 3 and 4 respectively), and no R, O, S, E, T are allowed.

Remaining letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and N, and we have three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) but I can’t be in 3 and N can’t be in 4.  
A promising pattern is:  
_ A I N _ or _ A N I _ or _ A _ I N or _ A _ N I, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
- Position 1: Could be D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y  
- Position 2: A (fixed)  
- Position 3: Could be I (but then N can’t be in 4)  
- Position 4: Could be N (but then I can’t be in 3)  
- Position 5: Could be another letter.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:
- C (new letter)  
- A (correct position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3, since the feedback only said I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3; here it’s position 3 again but that’s allowed because the feedback was “I(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3 of TAINT, so position 3 is fine for I)  
- N (allowed in position 4, since the feedback was “N(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 4 of TAINT, so position 4 is fine)  
- H (new letter)

But wait, in TAINT, position 4 was N with feedback “N(-)”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4. So “CHAIN” is invalid because it places N in position 4.

Let me rethink. We need N somewhere not in position 4, and I somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ A I _ N (I in 3, N in 5) – but I can’t be in 3 (since TAINT had I in 3 with “-” feedback, meaning I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3, so I can be in 3 here, but it’s safer to move I elsewhere)
- _ A _ I N (N in 5, I in 4) – this works because N isn’t in 4 and I isn’t in 3
- _ A N _ I (N in 3, I in 5) – but N can’t be in 4, so 3 is fine
- _ A _ N I (N in 4 – invalid, same as above)

The best safe pattern seems _ A _ I N or _ A N _ I.

Let’s try “PAIN_” – but we need 5 letters. “PAINS” has S (excluded).  
“PAINT” was already tried.  
“FAINT” – F is new, but T is excluded.  
“GAINT” – G is new, T is excluded.  
“HAINT” – H is new, T is excluded.  
“BAINS” – S excluded.  
“CAIN_” – need 5 letters: “CAIN_” – nothing common.  
“DAINS” – S excluded.  
“MAINS” – S excluded.  
“PAINS” – S excluded.  
“VAINT” – T excluded.  
“WAIST” – S, T excluded.  
“PAKIN” – K is new, but “PAKIN” isn’t a common word.  
“MABIN” – not common.  
“LABIN” – not common.  
“GABIN” – not common.  
“HABIN” – not common.  
“CABIN” – C, A, B, I, N – this is valid and common!  
Check constraints:
C (new), A (correct pos 2), B (new), I (pos 4), N (pos 5).  
- A is in pos 2 – ✓  
- I is in pos 4 – allowed (feedback said I is not in pos 3 of TAINT, so pos 4 is fine)  
- N is in pos 5 – allowed (feedback said N is not in pos 4 of TAINT, so pos 5 is fine)  
- No R, O, S, E, T – ✓  
- All letters unique – good for info.

So “CABIN” is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, C, B  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  

Known positions:

- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from TAINT) or 4 (from CABIN).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ _ _
with I and N still to place, and they must go in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) while respecting the exclusions.

Allowed positions:

None of the above combinations form a valid English 5-letter word. This suggests we might need to revisit the placement assumptions.

Alternative approach: Maybe I and N can both be in position 1, but that would require two I’s or N’s, which isn’t allowed.

Wait, let’s list all possible valid English 5-letter words that fit the constraints:
- Must have A in position 2.
- Must contain I and N exactly once each.
- Must not contain R, O, S, E, T, C, B.
- Must not have I in 3 or 4, N in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1 or 3  

Case 1: I in 1, N in 3  
Word: I A N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) without repeats.  
Real word: “IAND_” – nothing.  
“IANK_” – nothing.  
“IANL_” – nothing.  
“IANM_” – nothing.  
“IANP_” – nothing.  
“IANU_” – nothing.  
“IANV_” – nothing.  
“IANW_” – nothing.  
“IANY_” – nothing.  
“IANG_” – “IANG_” – not a word.  
“IANF_” – “IANF_” – not a word.  
“IANJ_” – not a word.  
So no valid word here.

Case 2: N in 1, I in 5  
Word: N A _ _ I  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining pool.  
Valid English word: “NADLI” – no.  
“NAKLI” – no.  
“NALMI” – no.  
“NAPLI” – no.  
“NAULI” – yes! “NAULI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of water container in India).

Check constraints:
- N A U L I  
- A is in position 2 – ✓  
- Contains I in position 5 (allowed) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 1 (allowed) – ✓  
- No R, O, S, E, T, C, B – ✓  
- Letters U, L are new and allowed – ✓  

Therefore, “NAULI” is a valid next guess.

A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants.

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons.

From the new feedback on NAULI:

- N(-)  → N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.  
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.  
- I(✓) → I is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ _ I

with the additional constraints:
- Must contain N exactly once, and N is NOT in position 1 or 4 or 5.  
  Therefore N must be in position 3.

So the word must be: _ A N _ I

We still need one more letter for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters (all letters except R, O, S, E, T, C, B, U, L).

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Wait, let me double-check “KANGI” – yes, “KANGI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of garment). It fits the pattern _ A N _ I with K in position 1 and G in position 4, and it uses only allowed letters (K, A, N, G, I) and respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “KANGI”.
</think>

<guess>KANGI</guess>",KANGI,"From the new feedback on NAULI:

- N(-)  → N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.  
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.  
- I(✓) → I is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ _ I

with the additional constraints:
- Must contain N exactly once, and N is NOT in position 1 or 4 or 5.  
  Therefore N must be in position 3.

So the word must be: _ A N _ I

We still need one more letter for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters (all letters except R, O, S, E, T, C, B, U, L).

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and avoiding duplicates. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers the vowels A, O, E and consonants R, S.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Excludes R, O, S, E.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ _ or _ _ A _ _ or _ _ _ A _ or _ _ _ _ A.

A strong next guess would cover new common letters while placing A in a different position. ""TAINT"" is a good candidate because:
- It has A in position 2.
- It uses T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested yet.
- It doesn't use any excluded letters (R, O, S, E).

Another option is ""PAINT"" or ""FAINT"", but ""TAINT"" seems slightly more common. I'll go with ""TAINT"".

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, E, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  
Known positions:  
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (from TAINT: A(✓)).  
- I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ _ _  
with the additional constraints that I and N must appear somewhere else in the word (not in positions 3 and 4 respectively), and no R, O, S, E, T are allowed.

Remaining letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y, etc.

We still need to place I and N, and we have three open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) but I can’t be in 3 and N can’t be in 4.  
A promising pattern is:  
_ A I N _ or _ A N I _ or _ A _ I N or _ A _ N I, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits:  
- Position 1: Could be D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, U, Y  
- Position 2: A (fixed)  
- Position 3: Could be I (but then N can’t be in 4)  
- Position 4: Could be N (but then I can’t be in 3)  
- Position 5: Could be another letter.

A good candidate is “CHAIN”:
- C (new letter)  
- A (correct position 2)  
- I (allowed in position 3, since the feedback only said I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3; here it’s position 3 again but that’s allowed because the feedback was “I(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3 of TAINT, so position 3 is fine for I)  
- N (allowed in position 4, since the feedback was “N(-)” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 4 of TAINT, so position 4 is fine)  
- H (new letter)

But wait, in TAINT, position 4 was N with feedback “N(-)”, meaning N is in the word but not in position 4. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4. So “CHAIN” is invalid because it places N in position 4.

Let me rethink. We need N somewhere not in position 4, and I somewhere not in position 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ A I _ N (I in 3, N in 5) – but I can’t be in 3 (since TAINT had I in 3 with “-” feedback, meaning I is not in position 3 of TAINT, which was position 3, so I can be in 3 here, but it’s safer to move I elsewhere)
- _ A _ I N (N in 5, I in 4) – this works because N isn’t in 4 and I isn’t in 3
- _ A N _ I (N in 3, I in 5) – but N can’t be in 4, so 3 is fine
- _ A _ N I (N in 4 – invalid, same as above)

The best safe pattern seems _ A _ I N or _ A N _ I.

Let’s try “PAIN_” – but we need 5 letters. “PAINS” has S (excluded).  
“PAINT” was already tried.  
“FAINT” – F is new, but T is excluded.  
“GAINT” – G is new, T is excluded.  
“HAINT” – H is new, T is excluded.  
“BAINS” – S excluded.  
“CAIN_” – need 5 letters: “CAIN_” – nothing common.  
“DAINS” – S excluded.  
“MAINS” – S excluded.  
“PAINS” – S excluded.  
“VAINT” – T excluded.  
“WAIST” – S, T excluded.  
“PAKIN” – K is new, but “PAKIN” isn’t a common word.  
“MABIN” – not common.  
“LABIN” – not common.  
“GABIN” – not common.  
“HABIN” – not common.  
“CABIN” – C, A, B, I, N – this is valid and common!  
Check constraints:
C (new), A (correct pos 2), B (new), I (pos 4), N (pos 5).  
- A is in pos 2 – ✓  
- I is in pos 4 – allowed (feedback said I is not in pos 3 of TAINT, so pos 4 is fine)  
- N is in pos 5 – allowed (feedback said N is not in pos 4 of TAINT, so pos 5 is fine)  
- No R, O, S, E, T – ✓  
- All letters unique – good for info.

So “CABIN” is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, C, B  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, I, N  

Known positions:
- A is in position 2 (fixed).
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from TAINT) or 4 (from CABIN).  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4 (from TAINT) or 5 (from CABIN).

So the pattern is:
_ A _ _ _
with I and N still to place, and they must go in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4, 5) while respecting the exclusions.

Allowed positions:
- I cannot be in 3 or 4 → I must be in position 1 or 5.
- N cannot be in 4 or 5 → N must be in position 1 or 3.

We also have no repeats of letters and must use only letters not yet excluded.

Remaining candidate letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Case 1: I in position 1, N in position 3  
Word form: I A N _ _  
Need two more distinct letters from remaining pool, no repeats.  
Example: I A N D _ → IAND_ (invalid), I A N D Y → IANDY (invalid), I A N D K → IANDK (invalid).

Case 2: N in position 1, I in position 5

None of the above combinations form a valid English 5-letter word. This suggests we might need to revisit the placement assumptions.

Alternative approach: Maybe I and N can both be in position 1, but that would require two I’s or N’s, which isn’t allowed.

Wait, let’s list all possible valid English 5-letter words that fit the constraints:
- Must have A in position 2.
- Must contain I and N exactly once each.
- Must not contain R, O, S, E, T, C, B.
- Must not have I in 3 or 4, N in 4 or 5.

Possible positions for I: 1 or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1 or 3  

Case 1: I in 1, N in 3  
Word: I A N _ _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y) without repeats.  
Real word: “IAND_” – nothing.  
“IANK_” – nothing.  
“IANL_” – nothing.  
“IANM_” – nothing.  
“IANP_” – nothing.  
“IANU_” – nothing.  
“IANV_” – nothing.  
“IANW_” – nothing.  
“IANY_” – nothing.  
“IANG_” – “IANG_” – not a word.  
“IANF_” – “IANF_” – not a word.  
“IANJ_” – not a word.  
So no valid word here.

Case 2: N in 1, I in 5  
Word: N A _ _ I  
Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from remaining pool.  
Valid English word: “NADLI” – no.  
“NAKLI” – no.  
“NALMI” – no.  
“NAPLI” – no.  
“NAULI” – yes! “NAULI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of water container in India).

Check constraints:
- N A U L I  
- A is in position 2 – ✓  
- Contains I in position 5 (allowed) – ✓  
- Contains N in position 1 (allowed) – ✓  
- No R, O, S, E, T, C, B – ✓  
- Letters U, L are new and allowed – ✓  

Therefore, “NAULI” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TAINT -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) T(x)

From the new feedback on NAULI:

- N(-)  → N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).  
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.  
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.  
- I(✓) → I is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ _ I

with the additional constraints:
- Must contain N exactly once, and N is NOT in position 1 or 4 or 5.  
  Therefore N must be in position 3.

So the word must be: _ A N _ I

We still need one more letter for position 1 and one for position 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters (all letters except R, O, S, E, T, C, B, U, L).

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? A N ? I.

Possible candidates:
- D A N K I → “DANKI” – not a word.  
- D A N C I – C is excluded.  
- F A N G I – not a word.  
- G A N G I – not a word.  
- H A N D I – yes, “HANDB” is not 5 letters, but “HAN” is not 5.

Wait, let me double-check “KANGI” – yes, “KANGI” is a valid 5-letter word (a type of garment). It fits the pattern _ A N _ I with K in position 1 and G in position 4, and it uses only allowed letters (K, A, N, G, I) and respects all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “KANGI”.

A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known)  
N(✓) → N is in position 3 (already deduced)  
G(✓) → G is in position 4 (already deduced)  
I(✓) → I is in position 5 (already deduced)

So the only unknown is position 1.  
The pattern is now: _ A N G I

Letters already excluded: R, O, S, E, T, C, B, U, L, K  
Remaining possible first letters: D, F, H, J, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form ? A N G I.

Quick scan:
- D A N G I → “DANGI” – not a standard word  
- F A N G I – not a word  
- H A N G I – not a word  
- J A N G I – not a word  
- M A N G I – not a word  
- P A N G I – not a word  
- V A N G I – not a word  
- W A N G I – not a word  
- Y A N G I – not a word  

The only common English word that fits is “HANGI” (a Maori cooking method), but it’s obscure.  
However, “HANGI” is listed in most dictionaries as a valid 5-letter word.

All letters H, A, N, G, I are allowed and satisfy the constraints.

Therefore, the final guess is “HANGI”.
