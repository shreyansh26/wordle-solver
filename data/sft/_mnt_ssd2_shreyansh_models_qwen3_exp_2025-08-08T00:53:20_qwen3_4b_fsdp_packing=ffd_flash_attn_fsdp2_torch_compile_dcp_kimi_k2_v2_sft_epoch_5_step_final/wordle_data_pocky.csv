### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AUDIO (vowels and common consonant)

I'll go with **SLATE** as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L), which should help narrow down possibilities effectively.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that uses any of those letters.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out and O is fixed in position 2)

A good next guess should test common remaining consonants and the vowel I.  
Let’s try a word like “CHOIR”:
- C, H, O, I, R — but R is already eliminated.  
Try “COBIA”:
- C, O, B, I, A — A is eliminated.  
Try “COBIR”:
- C, O, B, I, R — R is eliminated.  
Try “COBIX”:
- C, O, B, I, X — all letters are still allowed (X is rare but allowed).

But a more common word is better. Let’s try “COBIA” again but check letters: A is out.  
Next option: “COGIX” — not common.  
Try “COMIX” — X is allowed, but M and I are allowed.  
Wait, O is fixed in position 2, so word must be _ O _ _ _.  
Let’s list possible words with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters:

Possible pattern: ? O ? ? ?  
Good consonants to test: C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.  
Vowel to test: I

A common word fitting: “CHOCK” — but C is repeated and K is allowed.  
“CHOCK” uses C, H, O, C, K — C is repeated but allowed.  
However, we might prefer to test more unique letters.

Another option: “PHLOM” — not a word.  
“BOGUS” — S is out.  
“FOGIE” — E is out.  
“MOGUL” — L is out.  
“POKER” — R, E, K — E is out, R is out.  
“HONEY” — E, N, Y — E, N are out.  
“WOMBY” — M, B, Y — all allowed.  
“WOMBY” is a word (though rare), but let’s try a more common one.

“COMFY” — F, Y allowed.  
“COMFY” is a word, uses C, O, M, F, Y — all allowed.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x-marked):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, M, F

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y  
and the letters we know are in the word are C and Y (but Y is already placed).

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters not yet eliminated.  
Available consonants: B, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Available vowels: I (only remaining vowel)

Let’s try to place C in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 1).  
A common word fitting _ O _ _ Y with C somewhere is “BOGUS”, but G and S are allowed?  
Wait, S is eliminated.  
“BOGUS” uses S — out.

“COBIA” — A is out.  
“COBIR” — R is out.  
“COGIA” — A is out.  
“COGIC” — C repeated, but let’s see: _ O G I C — Y must be last, so this doesn’t fit.

We need _ O _ _ Y with C in 3 or 4 and I possible.

Try “POKIC” — no, must end with Y.

Let’s list possible words ending in O _ _ Y with C in 3 or 4 and I in remaining:

Possible: B O I C Y — “BOICY” (not a word)  
P O I C Y — “POICY” (not a word)  
H O I C Y — “HOICY” (not a word)  
J O I C Y — “JOICY” (not a word)  
K O I C Y — “KOICY” (not a word)  
C O I C Y — but C can’t be in position 1.

Wait, C must be in 3 or 4.

Try: B O C I Y — “BOCIY” (not a word)  
H O C I Y — “HOCY” (not a word)  
P O C I Y — “POCIY” (not a word)  
J O C I Y — “JOCY” (not a word)  
K O C I Y — “KOCY” (not a word)  

Try vowels in 3 and 4: but only I is left.

“BOI C Y” — not a word.

Let’s think of real 5-letter words ending in O _ _ Y with C in 3 or 4:

“BOGUS” — S out.  
“BOOZY” — Z allowed, but O repeated.  
“BOOZY” uses O twice — allowed, but we don’t know about Z yet.

“BOOZY” is a word, uses B, O, O, Z, Y — all letters not eliminated.

But we know C must be in the word somewhere, and “BOOZY” doesn’t have C.  
So this is invalid.

We must include C.

Real words ending in O _ _ Y with C:
“BOC Y” — no.  
“COBY” — too short.  
“COBY” isn’t 5 letters.

Wait, we need _ O _ _ Y with C in 3 or 4.

Real words:
“BOC C Y” — no.  
“COB C Y” — no.  
“BOC K Y” — no.  

Let me think differently: the word must be _ O _ _ Y, contain C (not in 1), and no eliminated letters.

Possible positions for C: 3 or 4.

Let’s try “BOC K Y” — “BOCKY” (not a word).  
“BOC C Y” — “BOCCY” (not a word).  
“BOC I Y” — “BOCIY” (not a word).  

Try “POC K Y” — “POCKY” (valid word, slang for “pocket” or a name).

Letters: P, O, C, K, Y — none eliminated.  
C is in position 3 (allowed), O in 2, Y in 5.  
“POCKY” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s go with POCKY.
