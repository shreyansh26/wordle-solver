For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the chances of hitting at least some letters in the correct or wrong positions.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these would be ideal.

Some good options would be:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (4th spot).
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ A _

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A as its 4th letter.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, M, P, D, G, B, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Let me think of words fitting _ _ _ A _ without S, L, T, E.

Examples: RADIO, CHAIR, MANGO, PIANO, ROAST (but OAST has S which is out), etc.

A valid word: “HUMAN” – but H, U, M, A, N.  
Check letters: H, U, M, N are all new and allowed.  
Pattern: _ _ _ A _ → “HUMAN” fits _ _ _ A _ only if A is 4th, but “HUMAN” is H-U-M-A-N, which has A as 4th letter.  
So “HUMAN” is a valid guess.

Let’s go with HUMAN.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are OUT (never appear anywhere):
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, M, N

Letters that are IN but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- A – must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from RADIO and HUMAN feedback).
- U – confirmed in the word, but we don’t yet know its position.

So the word contains both A and U, with the constraints:
- A cannot be 2nd or 4th.
- U is somewhere (position unknown).
- No other letters from the banned list are allowed.

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 5  
Possible positions for U: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (but must avoid conflicts)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not in the banned set (so far: A, U, plus any of B, C, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z that haven’t been tested).
2. Contains both A and U.
3. Respects the positional restrictions above.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit:

- JUMPY – contains J, U, M, P, Y; M is banned → invalid
- CUBIC – contains C, U, B, I, C; I is banned → invalid
- VAULT – contains V, A, U, L, T; L, T banned → invalid
- QUACK – Q, U, A, C, K; all letters allowed and not banned yet.  
  Check positions: A is 3rd (allowed), U is 2nd (allowed).  
  No banned letters appear.  
  “QUACK” is a valid English word.

Therefore, QUACK is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the chances of hitting at least some letters in the correct or wrong positions.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word that uses several of these would be ideal.

Some good options would be:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (4th spot).
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ _ A _

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A as its 4th letter.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, M, P, D, G, B, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already placed).

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A _
Let me think of words fitting _ _ _ A _ without S, L, T, E.

Examples: RADIO, CHAIR, MANGO, PIANO, ROAST (but OAST has S which is out), etc.

I'll pick RADIO:
- R, A, D, I, O - none of S, L, T, E.
- A is in the correct 4th position.
- Uses R, D, I, O which are common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)

2. RADIO → R(x) A(-) D(x) I(x) O(x)  
   - A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.  
   - R, D, I, O are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Pattern so far: _ _ _ A _
- Letters that are OUT: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O
- A is locked in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: N, C, M, P, G, B, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A is placed and E, I, O are out).

We need a 5-letter word with A in the 4th spot and none of the banned letters.  
Let’s try to cover new common letters. A good candidate is “C” + “H” + “U” + “N” + “A” → “CHUNA” is not a valid word.  
Another option: “M” + “U” + “N” + “A” + “N” → “MUNAN” – invalid.  
“B” + “U” + “N” + “A” + “N” → “BUNAN” – invalid.  
“G” + “U” + “N” + “A” + “N” → “GUNAN” – invalid.  
“P” + “U” + “N” + “A” + “N” → “PUNAN” – invalid.  

A valid word: “HUMAN” – but H, U, M, A, N.  
Check letters: H, U, M, N are all new and allowed.  
Pattern: _ _ _ A _ → “HUMAN” fits _ _ _ A _ only if A is 4th, but “HUMAN” is H-U-M-A-N, which has A as 4th letter.  
So “HUMAN” is a valid guess.

Let’s extract every constraint from the four rounds.

Letters that are OUT (never appear):
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, M, N, C

Letters that are IN and must appear:
- Q – in the word and already placed at position 1 (✓ in first slot).
- U – in the word, position unknown.
- A – in the word, position unknown, but NOT 2nd or 4th (from RADIO & HUMAN) and NOT 3rd (because QUACK showed A in 3rd slot as ✓, so A is now locked to position 3).

So the pattern so far is:
Q _ A _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z
Plus the already-known Q, U, A.

We know U must appear somewhere in the remaining two slots (positions 2 or 5) because:
- Position 1: Q (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Positions 2, 4, 5: open, but position 4 was shown as empty in QUACK (C was x), so U could be 2nd or 5th.

We also know K is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from QUACK feedback: K(-)), so K must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list valid placements:

Option 1: U in position 2 → word becomes Q U A _ _
   Then K must go in position 4 → Q U A K _
   Last letter (position 5) must be from remaining allowed set: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Valid English word: QUAKY (slang for “quick-tempered”).

Option 2: U in position 5 → word becomes Q _ A _ U
   Then K must go in position 2 or 4.
   - K in position 2 → Q K A _ U → need a valid 4th letter from allowed set: Q K A B U, Q K A F U, etc. → no common word.
   - K in position 4 → Q _ A K U → need a valid 2nd letter from allowed set: Q B A K U, Q F A K U, etc. → no common word.

Thus the only valid candidate is QUAKY.

<guess>QUAKY</guess>",QUAKY,"Let’s extract every constraint from the four rounds.

Letters that are OUT (never appear):
S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, H, M, N, C

Letters that are IN and must appear:
- Q – in the word and already placed at position 1 (✓ in first slot).
- U – in the word, position unknown.
- A – in the word, position unknown, but NOT 2nd or 4th (from RADIO & HUMAN) and NOT 3rd (because QUACK showed A in 3rd slot as ✓, so A is now locked to position 3).

So the pattern so far is:
Q _ A _ _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z
Plus the already-known Q, U, A.

We know U must appear somewhere in the remaining two slots (positions 2 or 5) because:
- Position 1: Q (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Positions 2, 4, 5: open, but position 4 was shown as empty in QUACK (C was x), so U could be 2nd or 5th.

We also know K is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from QUACK feedback: K(-)), so K must be in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list valid placements:

Option 1: U in position 2 → word becomes Q U A _ _
   Then K must go in position 4 → Q U A K _
   Last letter (position 5) must be from remaining allowed set: B, F, G, J, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Valid English word: QUAKY (slang for “quick-tempered”).

Option 2: U in position 5 → word becomes Q _ A _ U
   Then K must go in position 2 or 4.
   - K in position 2 → Q K A _ U → need a valid 4th letter from allowed set: Q K A B U, Q K A F U, etc. → no common word.
   - K in position 4 → Q _ A K U → need a valid 2nd letter from allowed set: Q B A K U, Q F A K U, etc. → no common word.

Thus the only valid candidate is QUAKY.",Guess 5: QUAKY -> FEEDBACK: Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
