### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U, Y (since A is already used).

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. ""SLATE"" is out because it has E. ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 (bad). ""BAITS"" has A in position 2 - that's fine. ""BAITS"" uses B, A, I, T, S - all allowed letters.

Another option is ""FAINT"" but it has N (forbidden). ""GLOAT"" has O and A, but O is in position 2 and A in position 4 - that's okay. ""GLOAT"" uses G, L, O, A, T - all allowed.

A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains the letters C, R, A, N, E - which are all very common in English words.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, B, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: A (position 2), S (position 5)  
Letters that are in the word but in wrong positions: I (not 3), L (not 4)

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ S  
I must appear in position 1 or 4  
L must appear in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1 or 3  

Possible placements:
- I in 1, L in 3 → I A L _ S
- I in 4, L in 1 → L A _ I S

Allowed letters (excluding forbidden ones): D, F, G, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, plus I, L

Check valid words:

1. I A L _ S → I A L _ S. Need a letter for position 4 from allowed list.  
   I A L D S – not a word  
   I A L G S – not a word  
   I A L K S – not a word  
   I A L M S – not a word  
   I A L O S – not a word  
   I A L P S – not a word  
   I A L U S – not a word  
   I A L V S – not a word  
   I A L W S – not a word  
   I A L Y S – not a word  

2. L A _ I S → L A _ I S. Need a letter for position 3 from allowed list.  
   L A D I S – “LADIS” is not standard  
   L A G I S – not a word  
   L A K I S – not a word  
   L A M I S – not a word  
   L A O I S – not a word  
   L A P I S – “LAPIS” is valid (variant of “lapis lazuli”)

“LAPIS” fits all constraints:
- L (allowed, in position 1)  
- A (correct position 2)  
- P (allowed)  
- I (in word, now in position 4 – satisfies “I is in word but not in 3”)  
- S (correct position 5)
