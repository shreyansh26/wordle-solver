For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering some of the most common letters in English words. 

After considering these options, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because the vowels A, O, E are very common and appear in many 5-letter words, while R and S are also very common. This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

None of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all. That eliminates a large chunk of common letters. I now need a word that uses completely different letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels left are I and U (Y can sometimes act as a vowel).

A strong second guess should use a fresh set of high-frequency letters. ""UNTIL"" is a good candidate: U, N, T, I, L. These are all new letters and cover several common consonants plus two vowels we haven't tested.

Another solid option is ""BLUNT"" (B, L, U, N, T) which also covers new high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""UNTIL"" as it uses slightly more common letters (T, N, L) and includes U and I as the only vowels.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering some of the most common letters in English words. 

After considering these options, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because the vowels A, O, E are very common and appear in many 5-letter words, while R and S are also very common. This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

None of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all. That eliminates a large chunk of common letters. I now need a word that uses completely different letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc. Good vowels left are I and U (Y can sometimes act as a vowel).

A strong second guess should use a fresh set of high-frequency letters. ""UNTIL"" is a good candidate: U, N, T, I, L. These are all new letters and cover several common consonants plus two vowels we haven't tested.

Another solid option is ""BLUNT"" (B, L, U, N, T) which also covers new high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""UNTIL"" as it uses slightly more common letters (T, N, L) and includes U and I as the only vowels.

From the feedback so far:
- A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L are all NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter U.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L.
- The U is NOT in position 1 (since UNTIL gave U(-)).

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, Y, B, F, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: none except possibly Y.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U somewhere (but not first).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- ""CUPID"" – but D is still allowed, but I is eliminated.
- ""DUMPY"" – uses D, U, M, P, Y; none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- ""HUMPY"" – H, U, M, P, Y.
- ""BUMPY"" – B, U, M, P, Y.

Among these, ""DUMPY"" seems solid as it tests D, U, M, P, Y – all new letters.

- Has U somewhere (but not first).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- ""CUPID"" – but D is still allowed, but I is eliminated.
- ""DUMPY"" – uses D, U, M, P, Y; none of these letters have been ruled out yet.
- ""HUMPY"" – H, U, M, P, Y.
- ""BUMPY"" – B, U, M, P, Y.

Among these, ""DUMPY"" seems solid as it tests D, U, M, P, Y – all new letters.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M, P  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: U (and it is in position 2), Y (and it is in position 5)  
- Positions 1, 3, 4 must be filled with letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has Y in position 5.
3. Uses only letters from the “still allowed” set (none of A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M, P).

Some candidate patterns: _ U _ _ Y

Good possibilities:
- BUGGY – but G and G are allowed, but BUGGY has two G’s and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.
- CUCKY – but C, U, C, K, Y: C and K are allowed, but is CUCKY a valid word? It seems obscure.
- FUDGY – F, U, D, G, Y: D is already eliminated (x), so no.
- HUCKY – H, U, C, K, Y: H, C, K are allowed; HUCKY is a valid word (though rare).
- JUMPY – J, U, M, P, Y: M and P are eliminated, so no.
- KUCKY – K, U, C, K, Y: K and C are allowed; KUCKY is valid but uncommon.
- VULKY – V, U, L, K, Y: L is eliminated, so no.
- WUCKY – W, U, C, K, Y: W, U, C, K, Y are all allowed; WUCKY is a valid word.

Between HUCKY, KUCKY, and WUCKY, WUCKY is the most common of these three.

So I’ll guess WUCKY.

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern so far: _ U _ _ Y
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, M, P, W, C, K  
- Remaining common letters to try: B, F, G, H, J, Q, V, X, Z (but we’ll stick to the more frequent ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Has Y in position 5.
3. Uses only letters from the “still allowed” set for positions 1, 3, 4.

Candidate patterns: B U _ _ Y, F U _ _ Y, G U _ _ Y, H U _ _ Y, J U _ _ Y, V U _ _ Y

Possible words:
- BUGGY – G and G are allowed, and BUGGY is a valid word.
- FUGGY – F and G are allowed, FUGGY is valid.
- GUMMY – M is eliminated, so no.
- HUGGY – H, G are allowed, HUGGY is valid.
- JUGGY – J, G are allowed, JUGGY is valid.
- VUGGY – V, G are allowed, VUGGY is valid.

Among these, BUGGY, HUGGY, and VUGGY are all strong. I’ll choose BUGGY because B is a very common starting letter and G is a common consonant.

But wait – BUGGY has G in positions 3 and 4, and we don’t yet know if duplicates are allowed. The game doesn’t forbid duplicates, so BUGGY is still a valid guess.

However, let’s double-check: is BUGGY a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it means “a buggie” or “bug car.”

So I’ll go with BUGGY.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet\'s most common letters. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering some of the most common letters in English words. \n\nAfter considering these options, I think ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because the vowels A, O, E are very common and appear in many 5-letter words, while R and S are also very common.
