### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- S is in the word but not in 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in 5th position.
- A and O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, O

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Uses S somewhere other than position 4
3. Uses E somewhere other than position 5
4. Avoids A and O
5. Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- R is in correct position 2
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would be bad)
Oops, that violates the S feedback.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (again violates S feedback)

Try ""BRISE"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (still bad)

Try ""DRIPS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 5 (but E must be somewhere, and this doesn't use E)

Try ""TRIES"" again - same issue.

Better approach: S must be in position 1, 3, or 5; E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""SERFS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 1 ✓ (allowed)
- E in position 3 ✓ (allowed)
- Avoids A, O ✓
- Uses F to test new letter

This seems good.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R is fixed in position 2.
- S and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5).
- A and O are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SERFS):
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (and we already knew not in 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew not in 5).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent with it being in position 2).
- F is not in the word.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters to exclude: A, O, F.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is taken by S in one of those cases).

Possible placements:
Case 1: S in 3 → then E must be in 1 or 4.
Case 2: S in 5 → then E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is now open).

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:
- If S is in 3:
  - E in 1: E R S _ _
  - E in 4: _ R S E _
- If S is in 5:
  - E in 1: E R _ _ S
  - E in 3: _ R E S (but then S is in 5, so this is _ R E S _)
  - E in 4: _ R _ E S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, F), and introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Looking at the patterns:
- E R S _ _ : third letter S, need two more letters (not A,O,F,S,E,R). Common ones: D, I, L, N, T, etc.
- _ R S E _ : third letter S, fourth E, need first and fifth letters.
- E R _ _ S : first E, last S, need second and third letters.
- _ R E S _ : third E, fourth S, need first and fifth letters.
- _ R _ E S : third letter ?, fourth E, last S, need first and second letters.

A quick scan for common words:
- E R S E _ – invalid (E twice).
- E R S _ _ : ERSON? (but O is excluded). ERST_? ERSTY? Not common.
- _ R S E _ : TRSE? Not a word. PRSE? Not a word. BRSE? Not a word.
- E R _ _ S : ERN? ERD? ERN? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? Actually, ""ER...S"" is tough.
- _ R E S _ : ""TRESN"" – no. ""DRESN"" – no. ""BRESN"" – no.
- _ R _ E S : ""CREDS"" – but D is allowed, S is known, but we already have S in 5. CRED S – but CRED is 4 letters, need 5.
- ""DRIES"" – but I is allowed, E is known, S is known. D R I E S – this fits:
  - D R I E S
  - R is in 2 ✓
  - S is in 5 (allowed, since S can be 3 or 5) – but in this pattern S is in 5, so that’s fine.
  - E is in 4 (allowed, since E can be 1,3,4) – here E is in 4 ✓
  - No A, O, F ✓
  - Uses new letters D, I.

This seems like a strong candidate.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- S is in the word but not in 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in 5th position.
- A and O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, O

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Uses S somewhere other than position 4
3. Uses E somewhere other than position 5
4. Avoids A and O
5. Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- R is in correct position 2
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would be bad)
Oops, that violates the S feedback.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (again violates S feedback)

Try ""BRISE"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (still bad)

Try ""DRIPS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 5 (but E must be somewhere, and this doesn't use E)

Try ""TRIES"" again - same issue.

Better approach: S must be in position 1, 3, or 5; E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""SERFS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 1 ✓ (allowed)
- E in position 3 ✓ (allowed)
- Avoids A, O ✓
- Uses F to test new letter

This seems good.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R is fixed in position 2.
- S and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5).
- A and O are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SERFS):
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (and we already knew not in 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew not in 5).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent with it being in position 2).
- F is not in the word.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters to exclude: A, O, F.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is taken by S in one of those cases).

Possible placements:
Case 1: S in 3 → then E must be in 1 or 4.
Case 2: S in 5 → then E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is now open).

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:
- If S is in 3:
  - E in 1: E R S _ _
  - E in 4: _ R S E _
- If S is in 5:
  - E in 1: E R _ _ S
  - E in 3: _ R E S (but then S is in 5, so this is _ R E S _)
  - E in 4: _ R _ E S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, F), and introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Looking at the patterns:
- E R S _ _ : third letter S, need two more letters (not A,O,F,S,E,R). Common ones: D, I, L, N, T, etc.
- _ R S E _ : third letter S, fourth E, need first and fifth letters.
- E R _ _ S : first E, last S, need second and third letters.
- _ R E S _ : third E, fourth S, need first and fifth letters.
- _ R _ E S : third letter ?, fourth E, last S, need first and second letters.

A quick scan for common words:
- E R S E _ – invalid (E twice).
- E R S _ _ : ERSON? (but O is excluded). ERST_? ERSTY? Not common.
- _ R S E _ : TRSE? Not a word. PRSE? Not a word. BRSE? Not a word.
- E R _ _ S : ERN? ERD? ERN? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? Actually, ""ER...S"" is tough.
- _ R E S _ : ""TRESN"" – no. ""DRESN"" – no. ""BRESN"" – no.
- _ R _ E S : ""CREDS"" – but D is allowed, S is known, but we already have S in 5. CRED S – but CRED is 4 letters, need 5.
- ""DRIES"" – but I is allowed, E is known, S is known. D R I E S – this fits:
  - D R I E S
  - R is in 2 ✓
  - S is in 5 (allowed, since S can be 3 or 5) – but in this pattern S is in 5, so that’s fine.
  - E is in 4 (allowed, since E can be 1,3,4) – here E is in 4 ✓
  - No A, O, F ✓
  - Uses new letters D, I.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Let’s update the state after the third guess.

Guess 3: DRIES
Feedback:
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still fixed in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is now fixed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ R _ _ S
Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), S (pos 5), E (somewhere in 1 or 3).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, F, D, I.

Therefore:
- Position 1: must be E (since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and 2 is R, 3 could be E but then where is E? Wait, E must be in 1 or 3 because 4 and 5 are excluded for E, and 2 is R.)
- Position 3: could be any allowed letter except A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E (but E could also be here if it’s not in 1).
Wait, let’s re-express:

E must appear exactly once, and cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. So E must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is S, position 2 is R, so remaining positions are 1,3,4.

E cannot be in 4 (from DRIES feedback: E(-) means not in position 4), so E must be in 1 or 3.

Thus two cases:
Case 1: E in 1 → word: E R _ _ S
Case 2: E in 3 → word: _ R E _ S

Now we need to fill the blank(s) with letters not yet excluded: allowed letters are from the rest (excluding A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E).

Common remaining letters: B, C, G, H, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Case 1: E R _ _ S
Possible: ER...S
- ERBYS – not common
- ERKES – no K yet, but let’s check
- ERN...S – ERN? ERNS? ERNYS? Not obvious.

Case 2: _ R E _ S
This seems more promising. Common words:
- B R E E S – but E is already used once, and we don’t know if E appears twice. Also, second E would be in position 4, which is allowed only if E appears twice. But original feedback suggests E appears once (since it was marked “-” not “✓”). So likely single E.
- C R E E S – same issue.
- G R E E S – same.
- T R E E S – same.
- B R E A S – but A is excluded.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but we have only one E.
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E P S – P is allowed, but “CREPS” is not a common word.
- G R E B S – not a word.
- T R E K S – K is allowed, but again double E issue.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- C R E S S – double S is unlikely since S is fixed in 5.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is _ R E _ S with no second E. Then:
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E N S – not a word.
- G R E N S – not a word.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but is “BREWS” a word? Yes, it is. And it has only one E in position 3, which fits _ R E _ S.

Let’s check:
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- R: fixed in 2 ✓
- E: must be in 3 (case 2) ✓
- W: allowed (not excluded)
- S: fixed in 5 ✓

No excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

Alternative: E in 1 → E R _ _ S
Possible: E R B E S – but again double E.
E R K E S – same.
E R N E S – same.
E R V E S – same.

Thus, the only common word fitting is BREWS.

Guess 3: DRIES
Feedback:
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still fixed in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is now fixed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ R _ _ S
Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), S (pos 5), E (somewhere in 1 or 3).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, F, D, I.

Therefore:
- Position 1: must be E (since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and 2 is R, 3 could be E but then where is E? Wait, E must be in 1 or 3 because 4 and 5 are excluded for E, and 2 is R.)
- Position 3: could be any allowed letter except A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E (but E could also be here if it’s not in 1).
Wait, let’s re-express:

E must appear exactly once, and cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. So E must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is S, position 2 is R, so remaining positions are 1,3,4.

E cannot be in 4 (from DRIES feedback: E(-) means not in position 4), so E must be in 1 or 3.

Thus two cases:
Case 1: E in 1 → word: E R _ _ S
Case 2: E in 3 → word: _ R E _ S

Now we need to fill the blank(s) with letters not yet excluded: allowed letters are from the rest (excluding A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E).

Common remaining letters: B, C, G, H, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

- G R E B S – not a word.
- T R E K S – K is allowed, but again double E issue.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- C R E S S – double S is unlikely since S is fixed in 5.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is _ R E _ S with no second E. Then:

- C R E N S – not a word.
- G R E N S – not a word.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but is “BREWS” a word? Yes, it is. And it has only one E in position 3, which fits _ R E _ S.

Let’s check:
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- R: fixed in 2 ✓
- E: must be in 3 (case 2) ✓
- W: allowed (not excluded)
- S: fixed in 5 ✓

No excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

Alternative: E in 1 → E R _ _ S
Possible: E R B E S – but again double E.
E R K E S – same.
E R N E S – same.
E R V E S – same.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).

- A and O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Uses S somewhere other than position 4
3. Uses E somewhere other than position 5
4. Avoids A and O
5. Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- R is in correct position 2
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would be bad)
Oops, that violates the S feedback.

Next try ""CRISP"":

Better approach: S must be in position 1, 3, or 5; E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""SERFS"":

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R is fixed in position 2.
- S and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5).
- A and O are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SERFS):
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (and we already knew not in 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew not in 5).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent with it being in position 2).
- F is not in the word.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters to exclude: A, O, F.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is taken by S in one of those cases).

Possible placements:
Case 1: S in 3 → then E must be in 1 or 4.
Case 2: S in 5 → then E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is now open).

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:
- If S is in 3:
  - E in 1: E R S _ _
  - E in 4: _ R S E _
- If S is in 5:
  - E in 1: E R _ _ S
  - E in 3: _ R E S (but then S is in 5, so this is _ R E S _)
  - E in 4: _ R _ E S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, F), and introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Looking at the patterns:
- E R S _ _ : third letter S, need two more letters (not A,O,F,S,E,R). Common ones: D, I, L, N, T, etc.
- _ R S E _ : third letter S, fourth E, need first and fifth letters.
- E R _ _ S : first E, last S, need second and third letters.
- _ R E S _ : third E, fourth S, need first and fifth letters.
- _ R _ E S : third letter ?, fourth E, last S, need first and second letters.

A quick scan for common words:
- E R S E _ – invalid (E twice).
- E R S _ _ : ERSON? (but O is excluded). ERST_? ERSTY? Not common.
- _ R S E _ : TRSE? Not a word. PRSE? Not a word. BRSE? Not a word.

- _ R E S _ : ""TRESN"" – no. ""DRESN"" – no. ""BRESN"" – no.
- _ R _ E S : ""CREDS"" – but D is allowed, S is known, but we already have S in 5. CRED S – but CRED is 4 letters, need 5.
- ""DRIES"" – but I is allowed, E is known, S is known. D R I E S – this fits:
  - D R I E S
  - R is in 2 ✓
  - S is in 5 (allowed, since S can be 3 or 5) – but in this pattern S is in 5, so that’s fine.
  - E is in 4 (allowed, since E can be 1,3,4) – here E is in 4 ✓
  - No A, O, F ✓
  - Uses new letters D, I.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SERFS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) E(-) R(-) F(x) S(✓)
Guess 3: DRIES -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(x) E(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update the state after the third guess.

Guess 3: DRIES
Feedback:
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still fixed in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is now fixed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ R _ _ S
Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), S (pos 5), E (somewhere in 1 or 3).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, F, D, I.

Therefore:
- Position 1: must be E (since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and 2 is R, 3 could be E but then where is E? Wait, E must be in 1 or 3 because 4 and 5 are excluded for E, and 2 is R.)
- Position 3: could be any allowed letter except A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E (but E could also be here if it’s not in 1).
Wait, let’s re-express:

E must appear exactly once, and cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. So E must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is S, position 2 is R, so remaining positions are 1,3,4.

E cannot be in 4 (from DRIES feedback: E(-) means not in position 4), so E must be in 1 or 3.

Thus two cases:
Case 1: E in 1 → word: E R _ _ S
Case 2: E in 3 → word: _ R E _ S

Now we need to fill the blank(s) with letters not yet excluded: allowed letters are from the rest (excluding A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E).

Common remaining letters: B, C, G, H, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Case 1: E R _ _ S
Possible: ER...S
- ERBYS – not common
- ERKES – no K yet, but let’s check
- ERN...S – ERN? ERNS? ERNYS? Not obvious.

Case 2: _ R E _ S
This seems more promising. Common words:
- B R E E S – but E is already used once, and we don’t know if E appears twice. Also, second E would be in position 4, which is allowed only if E appears twice. But original feedback suggests E appears once (since it was marked “-” not “✓”). So likely single E.
- C R E E S – same issue.
- G R E E S – same.
- T R E E S – same.
- B R E A S – but A is excluded.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but we have only one E.
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E P S – P is allowed, but “CREPS” is not a common word.
- G R E B S – not a word.
- T R E K S – K is allowed, but again double E issue.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- C R E S S – double S is unlikely since S is fixed in 5.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is _ R E _ S with no second E. Then:
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E N S – not a word.
- G R E N S – not a word.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but is “BREWS” a word? Yes, it is. And it has only one E in position 3, which fits _ R E _ S.

Let’s check:
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- R: fixed in 2 ✓
- E: must be in 3 (case 2) ✓
- W: allowed (not excluded)
- S: fixed in 5 ✓

No excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

Alternative: E in 1 → E R _ _ S
Possible: E R B E S – but again double E.
E R K E S – same.
E R N E S – same.
E R V E S – same.

Thus, the only common word fitting is BREWS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- S is in the word but not in 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in 5th position.
- A and O are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E
- Letters to exclude: A, O

I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Uses S somewhere other than position 4
3. Uses E somewhere other than position 5
4. Avoids A and O
5. Uses other common letters to gather more info

A good candidate is ""TRIES"":
- R is in correct position 2
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in position 4, so this would be bad)
Oops, that violates the S feedback.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (again violates S feedback)

Try ""BRISE"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 4 (still bad)

Try ""DRIPS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 5 (but E must be somewhere, and this doesn't use E)

Try ""TRIES"" again - same issue.

Better approach: S must be in position 1, 3, or 5; E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""SERFS"":
- R in position 2 ✓
- S in position 1 ✓ (allowed)
- E in position 3 ✓ (allowed)
- Avoids A, O ✓
- Uses F to test new letter

This seems good.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- R is fixed in position 2.
- S and E are in the word but not in their guessed positions (S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5).
- A and O are not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SERFS):
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (and we already knew not in 4).
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew not in 5).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (which is consistent with it being in position 2).
- F is not in the word.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to include: S, E (each must appear exactly once).
- Letters to exclude: A, O, F.
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → S must be in 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 2 or 5 → E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is taken by S in one of those cases).

Possible placements:
Case 1: S in 3 → then E must be in 1 or 4.
Case 2: S in 5 → then E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is now open).

Let’s enumerate valid patterns:
- If S is in 3:
  - E in 1: E R S _ _
  - E in 4: _ R S E _
- If S is in 5:
  - E in 1: E R _ _ S
  - E in 3: _ R E S (but then S is in 5, so this is _ R E S _)
  - E in 4: _ R _ E S

Now we need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, F), and introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Looking at the patterns:
- E R S _ _ : third letter S, need two more letters (not A,O,F,S,E,R). Common ones: D, I, L, N, T, etc.
- _ R S E _ : third letter S, fourth E, need first and fifth letters.
- E R _ _ S : first E, last S, need second and third letters.
- _ R E S _ : third E, fourth S, need first and fifth letters.
- _ R _ E S : third letter ?, fourth E, last S, need first and second letters.

A quick scan for common words:
- E R S E _ – invalid (E twice).
- E R S _ _ : ERSON? (but O is excluded). ERST_? ERSTY? Not common.
- _ R S E _ : TRSE? Not a word. PRSE? Not a word. BRSE? Not a word.
- E R _ _ S : ERN? ERD? ERN? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? ERNIS? Actually, ""ER...S"" is tough.
- _ R E S _ : ""TRESN"" – no. ""DRESN"" – no. ""BRESN"" – no.
- _ R _ E S : ""CREDS"" – but D is allowed, S is known, but we already have S in 5. CRED S – but CRED is 4 letters, need 5.
- ""DRIES"" – but I is allowed, E is known, S is known. D R I E S – this fits:
  - D R I E S
  - R is in 2 ✓
  - S is in 5 (allowed, since S can be 3 or 5) – but in this pattern S is in 5, so that’s fine.
  - E is in 4 (allowed, since E can be 1,3,4) – here E is in 4 ✓
  - No A, O, F ✓
  - Uses new letters D, I.

This seems like a strong candidate.

Let’s update the state after the third guess.

Guess 3: DRIES
Feedback:
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still fixed in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is now fixed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ R _ _ S
Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), S (pos 5), E (somewhere in 1 or 3).
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, F, D, I.

Therefore:
- Position 1: must be E (since E cannot be in 4 or 5, and 2 is R, 3 could be E but then where is E? Wait, E must be in 1 or 3 because 4 and 5 are excluded for E, and 2 is R.)
- Position 3: could be any allowed letter except A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E (but E could also be here if it’s not in 1).
Wait, let’s re-express:

E must appear exactly once, and cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5. So E must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is S, position 2 is R, so remaining positions are 1,3,4.

E cannot be in 4 (from DRIES feedback: E(-) means not in position 4), so E must be in 1 or 3.

Thus two cases:
Case 1: E in 1 → word: E R _ _ S
Case 2: E in 3 → word: _ R E _ S

Now we need to fill the blank(s) with letters not yet excluded: allowed letters are from the rest (excluding A, O, F, D, I, R, S, E).

Common remaining letters: B, C, G, H, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Case 1: E R _ _ S
Possible: ER...S
- ERBYS – not common
- ERKES – no K yet, but let’s check
- ERN...S – ERN? ERNS? ERNYS? Not obvious.

Case 2: _ R E _ S
This seems more promising. Common words:
- B R E E S – but E is already used once, and we don’t know if E appears twice. Also, second E would be in position 4, which is allowed only if E appears twice. But original feedback suggests E appears once (since it was marked “-” not “✓”). So likely single E.
- C R E E S – same issue.
- G R E E S – same.
- T R E E S – same.
- B R E A S – but A is excluded.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but we have only one E.
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E P S – P is allowed, but “CREPS” is not a common word.
- G R E B S – not a word.
- T R E K S – K is allowed, but again double E issue.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- C R E S S – double S is unlikely since S is fixed in 5.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is _ R E _ S with no second E. Then:
- B R E N S – not a word.
- C R E N S – not a word.
- G R E N S – not a word.
- T R E N S – not a word.
- B R E W S – W is allowed, but is “BREWS” a word? Yes, it is. And it has only one E in position 3, which fits _ R E _ S.

Let’s check:
- B: allowed (not excluded)
- R: fixed in 2 ✓
- E: must be in 3 (case 2) ✓
- W: allowed (not excluded)
- S: fixed in 5 ✓

No excluded letters are used. This seems valid.

Alternative: E in 1 → E R _ _ S
Possible: E R B E S – but again double E.
E R K E S – same.
E R N E S – same.
E R V E S – same.

Thus, the only common word fitting is BREWS.

From Guess 4 (BREWS) we just received:
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is still fixed in position 2.
- E(✓) → E is now fixed in position 3.
- W(✓) → W is fixed in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is fixed in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ R E W S

Only the first letter remains unknown.  
Letters already excluded: A, B, D, F, I, O, W (but W is already in position 4), S, R, E.

Allowed letters for position 1 (common remaining): C, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter English words ending in “REW S”:
- C R E W S → CREWS (valid word, C is allowed)
- G R E W S → G is allowed, but “GROWS” has an O which is excluded.
- O T H E R S → irrelevant.
- N E X T S → irrelevant.

Only CREWS fits perfectly.

Let’s confirm:
- C: not excluded.
- R: position 2 ✓
- E: position 3 ✓
- W: position 4 ✓
- S: position 5 ✓

No conflicts.
