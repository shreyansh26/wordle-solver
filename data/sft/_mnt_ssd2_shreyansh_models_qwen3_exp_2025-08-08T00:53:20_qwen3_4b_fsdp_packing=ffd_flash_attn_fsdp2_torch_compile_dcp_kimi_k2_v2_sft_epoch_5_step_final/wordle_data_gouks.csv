2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in 5-letter words. This gives us a broad sampling of the alphabet to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

Common letters still available: R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Good next guesses would use fresh common letters while placing S in new positions. Candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – places S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) – S in position 4, avoids forbidden letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in 5-letter words. This gives us a broad sampling of the alphabet to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

Common letters still available: R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Good next guesses would use fresh common letters while placing S in new positions. Candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – places S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) – S in position 4, avoids forbidden letters.
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S) – S in position 5, avoids forbidden letters.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) – S in position 5, avoids forbidden letters.

Among these, ""CRISP"" uses very common letters (C, R, I, S, P) and places S in position 4, giving maximal new information.

- Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Still-available common letters: D, G, H, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-available set.

Candidate words that fit:
- SOUND (S in position 1 – forbidden, so skip)
- SHOWN (S in position 1 – skip)

- NUMBS (S in position 5, uses N, U, M, B; all letters allowed)
- DUNGS (S in position 5, uses D, U, N, G; all letters allowed)

Between NUMBS and DUNGS, both are valid, but DUNGS uses slightly more common letters (D, U, N, G, S). Let’s choose DUNGS.

From the new feedback on FOGUS:

- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

Letters confirmed so far:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: S
- Letters in word somewhere: G, U
- Letters definitely out: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, N, F

Still-available letters (besides O, S, G, U): B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has S in position 5.
3. Contains both G and U in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4), with G not in 3 and U not in 4.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for G and U:
- G cannot be in 3, U cannot be in 4.
- Positions left: 1, 3, 4 (but 2 and 5 are fixed).

Enumerate possibilities:
- G in 1, U in 3 or 4 (but U not in 4) → G U _ _ (but position 5 is S) → G U _ _ S, but we need 5 letters total. Wait, positions are 1-5:
  - 1: ?
  - 2: O
  - 3: ?
  - 4: ?
  - 5: S

So word structure: _ O _ _ S

G and U must occupy positions 1, 3, 4 with constraints:
- G not in 3
- U not in 4

Possible distributions:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
2. G in 1, U in 4 → G O _ U S → but U cannot be in 4 → invalid
3. U in 1, G in 3 → U O G _ S → but G cannot be in 3 → invalid
4. U in 1, G in 4 → U O _ G S → valid
5. G in 3 → invalid (G cannot be in 3)
6. G in 4 → valid, then U must be in 1 or 3 (but 3 is open)
   - U in 1: U O _ G S
   - U in 3: _ O U G S → but position 1 would be empty, so _ O U G S → need letter for 1

So possible patterns:
- G O U _ S → need letter for 4
- U O _ G S → need letter for 3
- _ O U G S → need letter for 1

Looking at allowed letters, let's pick the first pattern: G O U _ S
We need a letter for position 4 from B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Choosing H gives G O U H S → GOUHS (but not a valid English word)
Choosing B gives G O U B S → GOUBS (valid? Seems like a surname, not common)
Choosing K gives G O U K S → GOUKS (not valid)
Choosing M gives G O U M S → GOUMS (not valid)
Choosing Y gives G O U Y S → GOUYS (not valid)

Next pattern: U O _ G S → need letter for 3 from allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Choosing B: U O B G S → UOBGS (not valid)
Choosing H: U O H G S → UOHGS (not valid)
Choosing K: U O K G S → UOKGS (not valid)

Choosing B: B O U G S → BOUGS (not valid)
Choosing H: H O U G S → HOUGS (not valid)
Choosing M: M O U G S → MOUGS (not valid)

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the distribution.

Wait, maybe G is in 4 and U in 1: U O _ G S → need letter for 3
Looking for valid words: U O _ G S
Possible middle letter: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- U O B G S → UOBGS (no)
- U O H G S → UOHGS (no)
- U O M G S → UOMGS (no)

Alternatively, G in 1, U in 3: G O U _ S → need letter for 4
Looking for valid words: G O U _ S
- G O U M S → GOUMS (no)
- G O U B S → GOUBS (no)
- G O U K S → GOUKS (no)

Wait, let's try G in 4 and U in 1 with a different middle letter:
U O _ G S → need a valid word
Looking up, ""UOGAS"" (no), ""UOGIS"" (no), ""UOGOS"" (no), ""UOGUS"" (no)

This suggests I might have missed another pattern. Let me list all possible placements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ O _ _ S

Letters to place: G, U
Constraints:
- G not in 3
- U not in 4

Possible placements:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need letter for 4
2. G in 1, U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
3. G in 4, U in 1 → U O _ G S → need letter for 3
4. G in 4, U in 3 → _ O U G S → need letter for 1
   - But G is in 4, so this would be _ O U G S → position 1 needed

Looking at valid English words ending in ""OUS"":
- BOUGS (no)
- COUGS (C is out)
- DOUGS (D is out)
- FOUGS (F is out)
- GOUGS (G is allowed, but is it a word? ""gougs"" is archaic for ""gouges"")
- HOUGS (no)
- JOUGS (no)
- MOUGS (no)
- NOUGS (N is out)
- POUGS (P is out)
- SOUGS (S is in 5, can't be here)
- TOUGS (T is out)
- VOUGS (no)
- WOUGS (no)
- XOUGS (no)
- YOUGS (no)
- ZOUGS (no)

""Gougs"" seems to be the only possible word here, but it's archaic. However, Wordle accepts ""gougs"" as a valid word (variant of ""gouge"").

Alternatively, let's check if there's another valid word structure:
Looking for _ O _ _ S with G and U in remaining positions:
- B O U G S → ""bougs"" (no)
- H O U G S → ""hous"" + G? No
- M O U G S → ""mougs"" (no)

Given the constraints, ""gougs"" appears to be the only possible word, despite being archaic. Alternatively, ""jougs"" (a surname/term for a type of knot) exists but is less common.

But let me double-check if I missed any letters. Allowed letters: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus G, O, U, S.

Another approach: maybe G is in 1 and U in 3 with a different letter:
G O U _ S → need letter for 4 from B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- G O U M S → ""goums"" (no)
- G O U K S → ""gouks"" (no)
- G O U B S → ""goubs"" (no)

This seems to confirm ""gougs"" is the only possible word. However, ""gougs"" has G in 1, O in 2, U in 4, but U cannot be in 4 (from feedback). Wait, in ""gougs"":
- G in 1
- O in 2
- U in 4 → but feedback says U is not in 4 → invalid

Ah! I made a mistake. In ""gougs"" the letters would be G, O, U, G, S → but we only have one G confirmed. However, the feedback only tells us G is in the word, not how many times. So ""gougs"" is actually valid as it has G in 1 and 4, but that's acceptable.

But let me check if ""gougs"" fits all constraints:
- O in 2 ✓
- S in 5 ✓
- G is in 1 and 4 → but we only know G is in the word, not necessarily once → acceptable
- U is in 3 → not restricted (only U not in 4)
- All letters used are allowed

Thus, ""gougs"" seems to be the only valid word left.
</think>

<guess>GOUGS</guess>",GOUGS,"From the new feedback on FOGUS:

- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 3.
- U(-) – U is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

Letters confirmed so far:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: S
- Letters in word somewhere: G, U
- Letters definitely out: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, N, F

Still-available letters (besides O, S, G, U): B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has S in position 5.
3. Contains both G and U in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4), with G not in 3 and U not in 4.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for G and U:
- G cannot be in 3, U cannot be in 4.
- Positions left: 1, 3, 4 (but 2 and 5 are fixed).

Enumerate possibilities:
- G in 1, U in 3 or 4 (but U not in 4) → G U _ _ (but position 5 is S) → G U _ _ S, but we need 5 letters total. Wait, positions are 1-5:
  - 1: ?
  - 2: O
  - 3: ?
  - 4: ?
  - 5: S

So word structure: _ O _ _ S

G and U must occupy positions 1, 3, 4 with constraints:
- G not in 3
- U not in 4

Possible distributions:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
2. G in 1, U in 4 → G O _ U S → but U cannot be in 4 → invalid
3. U in 1, G in 3 → U O G _ S → but G cannot be in 3 → invalid
4. U in 1, G in 4 → U O _ G S → valid
5. G in 3 → invalid (G cannot be in 3)
6. G in 4 → valid, then U must be in 1 or 3 (but 3 is open)
   - U in 1: U O _ G S
   - U in 3: _ O U G S → but position 1 would be empty, so _ O U G S → need letter for 1

So possible patterns:
- G O U _ S → need letter for 4
- U O _ G S → need letter for 3
- _ O U G S → need letter for 1

Looking at allowed letters, let's pick the first pattern: G O U _ S
We need a letter for position 4 from B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Choosing H gives G O U H S → GOUHS (but not a valid English word)
Choosing B gives G O U B S → GOUBS (valid? Seems like a surname, not common)
Choosing K gives G O U K S → GOUKS (not valid)
Choosing M gives G O U M S → GOUMS (not valid)
Choosing Y gives G O U Y S → GOUYS (not valid)

Next pattern: U O _ G S → need letter for 3 from allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Choosing B: U O B G S → UOBGS (not valid)
Choosing H: U O H G S → UOHGS (not valid)
Choosing K: U O K G S → UOKGS (not valid)
Choosing M: U O M G S → UOMGS (not valid)

Next pattern: _ O U G S → need letter for 1 from allowed set
Choosing B: B O U G S → BOUGS (not valid)
Choosing H: H O U G S → HOUGS (not valid)
Choosing M: M O U G S → MOUGS (not valid)

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the distribution.

Wait, maybe G is in 4 and U in 1: U O _ G S → need letter for 3
Looking for valid words: U O _ G S
Possible middle letter: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- U O B G S → UOBGS (no)
- U O H G S → UOHGS (no)
- U O M G S → UOMGS (no)

This suggests I might have missed another pattern. Let me list all possible placements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ O _ _ S

Letters to place: G, U
Constraints:

Possible placements:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need letter for 4
2. G in 1, U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
3. G in 4, U in 1 → U O _ G S → need letter for 3
4. G in 4, U in 3 → _ O U G S → need letter for 1
   - But G is in 4, so this would be _ O U G S → position 1 needed

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. 

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters in 5-letter words. This gives us a broad sampling of the alphabet to work with for subsequent guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Avoids L, A, T, E entirely.

Common letters still available: R, I, N, O, C, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Good next guesses would use fresh common letters while placing S in new positions. Candidates:
- SHORN (S, H, O, R, N) – places S in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in position 1), so skip.
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P) – S in position 4, avoids forbidden letters.
- DRIPS (D, R, I, P, S) – S in position 5, avoids forbidden letters.
- CHINS (C, H, I, N, S) – S in position 5, avoids forbidden letters.

Among these, ""CRISP"" uses very common letters (C, R, I, S, P) and places S in position 4, giving maximal new information.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

What we now know:

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Letters definitely absent: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P.
- Still-available common letters: D, G, H, M, N, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-available set.

Candidate words that fit:
- SOUND (S in position 1 – forbidden, so skip)
- SHOWN (S in position 1 – skip)
- MOUND (S missing – skip)
- HUMPS (S in position 5, uses H, U, M, P; but P is forbidden – skip)
- NUMBS (S in position 5, uses N, U, M, B; all letters allowed)
- DUNGS (S in position 5, uses D, U, N, G; all letters allowed)

Between NUMBS and DUNGS, both are valid, but DUNGS uses slightly more common letters (D, U, N, G, S). Let’s choose DUNGS.

Positions of S: 5 (allowed). All letters are still possible.

From the feedback so far:

   - S is confirmed in position 5.
   - U is in the word but not in position 2.
   - G is in the word but not in position 4.
   - D and N are not in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, N.

Letters still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 5.
- Contains U somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Contains G somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Uses only the still-possible letters.

Candidate words:
- BUGSY → B, U, G, S, Y; S in position 4 (wrong, must be 5) → skip.
- GUSHY → G, U, S, H, Y; S in position 3 (wrong) → skip.
- MOUSY → M, O, U, S, Y; S in position 4 (wrong) → skip.

From the new feedback on FOGUS:

Letters confirmed so far:

Still-available letters (besides O, S, G, U): B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has S in position 5.
3. Contains both G and U in the remaining open positions (1, 3, 4), with G not in 3 and U not in 4.
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for G and U:
- G cannot be in 3, U cannot be in 4.
- Positions left: 1, 3, 4 (but 2 and 5 are fixed).

Enumerate possibilities:
- G in 1, U in 3 or 4 (but U not in 4) → G U _ _ (but position 5 is S) → G U _ _ S, but we need 5 letters total. Wait, positions are 1-5:
  - 1: ?
  - 2: O
  - 3: ?
  - 4: ?
  - 5: S

So word structure: _ O _ _ S

G and U must occupy positions 1, 3, 4 with constraints:
- G not in 3
- U not in 4

Possible distributions:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need a letter for position 4 from remaining allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
2. G in 1, U in 4 → G O _ U S → but U cannot be in 4 → invalid
3. U in 1, G in 3 → U O G _ S → but G cannot be in 3 → invalid
4. U in 1, G in 4 → U O _ G S → valid
5. G in 3 → invalid (G cannot be in 3)
6. G in 4 → valid, then U must be in 1 or 3 (but 3 is open)
   - U in 1: U O _ G S
   - U in 3: _ O U G S → but position 1 would be empty, so _ O U G S → need letter for 1

So possible patterns:
- G O U _ S → need letter for 4
- U O _ G S → need letter for 3
- _ O U G S → need letter for 1

Looking at allowed letters, let's pick the first pattern: G O U _ S
We need a letter for position 4 from B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Choosing H gives G O U H S → GOUHS (but not a valid English word)
Choosing B gives G O U B S → GOUBS (valid? Seems like a surname, not common)
Choosing K gives G O U K S → GOUKS (not valid)
Choosing M gives G O U M S → GOUMS (not valid)
Choosing Y gives G O U Y S → GOUYS (not valid)

Next pattern: U O _ G S → need letter for 3 from allowed set (B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Choosing B: U O B G S → UOBGS (not valid)
Choosing H: U O H G S → UOHGS (not valid)
Choosing K: U O K G S → UOKGS (not valid)
Choosing M: U O M G S → UOMGS (not valid)

Next pattern: _ O U G S → need letter for 1 from allowed set
Choosing B: B O U G S → BOUGS (not valid)
Choosing H: H O U G S → HOUGS (not valid)
Choosing M: M O U G S → MOUGS (not valid)

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me reconsider the distribution.

Wait, maybe G is in 4 and U in 1: U O _ G S → need letter for 3
Looking for valid words: U O _ G S
Possible middle letter: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- U O B G S → UOBGS (no)
- U O H G S → UOHGS (no)
- U O M G S → UOMGS (no)

Alternatively, G in 1, U in 3: G O U _ S → need letter for 4
Looking for valid words: G O U _ S
- G O U M S → GOUMS (no)
- G O U B S → GOUBS (no)
- G O U K S → GOUKS (no)

Wait, let's try G in 4 and U in 1 with a different middle letter:
U O _ G S → need a valid word
Looking up, ""UOGAS"" (no), ""UOGIS"" (no), ""UOGOS"" (no), ""UOGUS"" (no)

This suggests I might have missed another pattern. Let me list all possible placements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ O _ _ S

Letters to place: G, U
Constraints:
- G not in 3
- U not in 4

Possible placements:
1. G in 1, U in 3 → G O U _ S → need letter for 4
2. G in 1, U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
3. G in 4, U in 1 → U O _ G S → need letter for 3
4. G in 4, U in 3 → _ O U G S → need letter for 1
   - But G is in 4, so this would be _ O U G S → position 1 needed

Looking at valid English words ending in ""OUS"":
- BOUGS (no)
- COUGS (C is out)

""Gougs"" seems to be the only possible word here, but it's archaic. However, Wordle accepts ""gougs"" as a valid word (variant of ""gouge"").

Alternatively, let's check if there's another valid word structure:
Looking for _ O _ _ S with G and U in remaining positions:
- B O U G S → ""bougs"" (no)
- H O U G S → ""hous"" + G? No
- M O U G S → ""mougs"" (no)

Given the constraints, ""gougs"" appears to be the only possible word, despite being archaic. Alternatively, ""jougs"" (a surname/term for a type of knot) exists but is less common.

But let me double-check if I missed any letters. Allowed letters: B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus G, O, U, S.

Another approach: maybe G is in 1 and U in 3 with a different letter:
G O U _ S → need letter for 4 from B, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- G O U M S → ""goums"" (no)
- G O U K S → ""gouks"" (no)
- G O U B S → ""goubs"" (no)

This seems to confirm ""gougs"" is the only possible word. However, ""gougs"" has G in 1, O in 2, U in 4, but U cannot be in 4 (from feedback). Wait, in ""gougs"":
- G in 1
- O in 2
- U in 4 → but feedback says U is not in 4 → invalid

Ah! I made a mistake. In ""gougs"" the letters would be G, O, U, G, S → but we only have one G confirmed. However, the feedback only tells us G is in the word, not how many times. So ""gougs"" is actually valid as it has G in 1 and 4, but that's acceptable.

But let me check if ""gougs"" fits all constraints:
- O in 2 ✓
- S in 5 ✓
- G is in 1 and 4 → but we only know G is in the word, not necessarily once → acceptable
- U is in 3 → not restricted (only U not in 4)
- All letters used are allowed

Thus, ""gougs"" seems to be the only valid word left.

From the latest feedback on GOUGS:

- G(✓) – G is in the word and in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and in position 3.
- G(-) – the second G is in the word but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 5, but position 5 is already S). This implies the word must have exactly one G, which is in position 1, and the feedback for GOUGS is indicating that the second G (position 4) is not part of the word, confirming only one G exists.

- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So the confirmed structure is:
1: G
2: O
3: U
4: ?
5: S

We need a letter for position 4 that is:
- not yet ruled out (not in {L, A, T, E, C, R, I, P, D, N, F}).
- and forms a valid English word: G O U _ S.

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""GOUST"" (G-O-U-S-T), but S is already fixed in position 5, so it would be G-O-U-S-T, which is 6 letters. This indicates an error in my previous assumption.

Re-evaluating: the word must be exactly 5 letters with positions 1-5 as:
1: G
2: O
3: U
4: ?

Looking for 5-letter words matching G O U _ S:
- ""GOUSH"" (G-O-U-S-H) – this fits perfectly: G(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), H(5). But our S is confirmed in position 5, so this would be G-O-U-S-H, which has S in position 4 – conflicting with our known S in 5.

Wait, this reveals a misunderstanding. The confirmed letters are:
1: G
2: O
3: U
5: S

Position 4 is unknown. The word must be G O U _ S, where the blank is position 4. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is ""GOUST"" (G-O-U-S-T), but this has S in position 4, not 5. This suggests no valid word exists under these constraints, indicating an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining the feedback:
- GOUGS feedback: G(✓) O(✓) U(✓) G(-) S(✓) implies:
  - Position 1: G
  - Position 2: O
  - Position 3: U
  - Position 5: S
  - Position 4: Not G (since second G is marked -), and must be another letter.

Thus, the word is G O U _ S, and the only possible letter for position 4 that forms a valid word is ""H"", making ""GOUSH"" (G-O-U-S-H), but this places S in position 4, conflicting with S in position 5.

This contradiction indicates the only possible interpretation is that the word must be ""GOUST"" (G-O-U-S-T), but this has S in position 4, not 5. Therefore, no valid word fits the constraints, suggesting an error in earlier feedback interpretation.

The only valid 5-letter word is ""GOUST"" (G-O-U-S-T), where position 4 is 'S' but this conflicts with S being in position 5. Realizing the only possible arrangement is:",Guess 6: GOUST -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) O(✓) U(✓) S(-) T(x),FAIL
