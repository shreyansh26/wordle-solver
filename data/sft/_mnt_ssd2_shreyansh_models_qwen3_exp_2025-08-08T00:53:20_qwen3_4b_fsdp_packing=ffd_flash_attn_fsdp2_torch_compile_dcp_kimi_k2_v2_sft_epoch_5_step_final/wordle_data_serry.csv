For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, O, V  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: R, E  

From CRANE:  
- R was in position 2 → it cannot be in position 2.  
- E was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  

From ROVER:  
- The first R was in position 1 → it cannot be in position 1.  
- The last R was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  
- E was in position 4 → it cannot be in position 4.  

So the constraints on the letters we have so far are:  
- R must be in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).  

We need a 5-letter word that:  
1. Contains both R and E exactly once each.  
2. Does not contain C, A, N, O, V.  
3. Places R in position 3 or 4.  
4. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.  

Looking at common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:  
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, U  

Let’s try to construct a word that fits these rules.  
A promising pattern is _ _ E R _ or _ E _ R _ or E _ _ R _ , etc., but R must be in 3 or 4.

One simple valid pattern is: E _ R _ _  
We can pick a consonant for position 2 and another for position 5.  
The word “ENTRY” comes to mind, but N and T are allowed?  
Wait: N is already ruled out (from CRANE).  
So “ENTRY” is invalid.

Another pattern: _ E R _ _  
We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
The word “FERNS” has N (invalid) and S is allowed, but N is out.  
“PERKY” has P, E, R, K, Y.  
Check:  
- Contains R and E → yes.  
- R is in position 3 → allowed.  
- E is in position 2 → allowed.  
- No C, A, N, O, V → yes.  

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
P E R K Y  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

Looks good.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, O, V  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: R, E  

From CRANE:  
- R was in position 2 → it cannot be in position 2.  
- E was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  

From ROVER:  
- The first R was in position 1 → it cannot be in position 1.  
- The last R was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  
- E was in position 4 → it cannot be in position 4.  

So the constraints on the letters we have so far are:  
- R must be in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).  

We need a 5-letter word that:  
1. Contains both R and E exactly once each.  
2. Does not contain C, A, N, O, V.  
3. Places R in position 3 or 4.  
4. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.  

Looking at common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:  
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, U  

Let’s try to construct a word that fits these rules.  
A promising pattern is _ _ E R _ or _ E _ R _ or E _ _ R _ , etc., but R must be in 3 or 4.

One simple valid pattern is: E _ R _ _  
We can pick a consonant for position 2 and another for position 5.  
The word “ENTRY” comes to mind, but N and T are allowed?  
Wait: N is already ruled out (from CRANE).  
So “ENTRY” is invalid.

Another pattern: _ E R _ _  
We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
The word “FERNS” has N (invalid) and S is allowed, but N is out.  
“PERKY” has P, E, R, K, Y.  
Check:  
- Contains R and E → yes.  
- R is in position 3 → allowed.  
- E is in position 2 → allowed.  
- No C, A, N, O, V → yes.  

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
P E R K Y  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

Looks good.

From the latest feedback:

PERKY → P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

1. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
2. R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
3. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
4. P and K are not in the word.

So the word has the fixed pattern: _ E R _ Y

Letters already ruled out from all previous feedback:
C, A, N, O, V, P, K

Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels to consider: I, U (but position 1 and 4 can be either)

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z
- Position 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z

Looking for common English words that fit _ E R _ Y:

Possible candidates:
- BERRY (but B is allowed, R is already used in position 3, so this would have two R's - possible)
- FERRY (F is allowed)
- HERRY (not a valid word)
- LERRY (not a valid word)
- MERRY (M is allowed, two R's)
- TERRY (T is allowed)
- WERRY (not a valid word)

Among these, the most common valid words are: BERRY, FERRY, MERRY, TERRY

Let's check each:
- BERRY: B E R R Y - has two R's, which is allowed in Wordle
- FERRY: F E R R Y - has two R's
- MERRY: M E R R Y - has two R's
- TERRY: T E R R Y - has two R's

All fit the pattern. Since we have no additional constraints, any of these could be correct. The most common starting letter among these is likely 'T' for TERRY, but let's consider the frequency of starting letters.

However, we can also consider words with different letters. Are there any _ E R _ Y words without repeating R?

Looking again:
- S E R F Y (not a word)
- S E R V Y (V is ruled out)
- S E R A Y (A is ruled out)
- S E R I Y (not a word)
- S E R U Y (not a word)
- S E R D Y (D is allowed, but ""SERDY"" is not a word)
- S E R L Y (not a word)

It seems most valid _ E R _ Y words have double R. Therefore, the best next guess is to pick one of these common words. Among BERRY, FERRY, MERRY, TERRY, ""TERRY"" is a valid and common word.

But wait, let's double-check if any of these have ruled-out letters:
- BERRY: B, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- FERRY: F, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- MERRY: M, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- TERRY: T, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters

All are valid. Since we have no further information, any of these could be correct. I'll choose ""TERRY"" as it's a common word.

Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ E R _ Y with E in position 2, R in position 3, and Y in position 5. The letters P, K, C, A, N, O, V are not in the word. A common word fitting this pattern is:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). It was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N
- Letters in the word but misplaced: R, E
- Positions ruled out for R: position 2
- Positions ruled out for E: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E (but R not in position 2, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain C, A, or N

Let’s look for a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""ROVER"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since position 2 is the only one ruled out for R)
- O is a new vowel to test
- V is a new consonant to test
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since position 5 is the only one ruled out for E)
- R is repeated, but this is allowed in Wordle

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Very common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter overall

This gives good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which letters are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-). It was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). It was in position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So far we know:
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N
- Letters in the word but misplaced: R, E
- Positions ruled out for R: position 2
- Positions ruled out for E: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E (but R not in position 2, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain C, A, or N

Let’s look for a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""ROVER"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since position 2 is the only one ruled out for R)
- O is a new vowel to test
- V is a new consonant to test
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since position 5 is the only one ruled out for E)
- R is repeated, but this is allowed in Wordle

""ROVER"" seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

Guess 2: ROVER -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(x) V(x) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, O, V  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: R, E  

From CRANE:  
- R was in position 2 → it cannot be in position 2.  
- E was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  

From ROVER:  
- The first R was in position 1 → it cannot be in position 1.  
- The last R was in position 5 → it cannot be in position 5.  
- E was in position 4 → it cannot be in position 4.  

So the constraints on the letters we have so far are:  
- R must be in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).  

We need a 5-letter word that:  
1. Contains both R and E exactly once each.  
2. Does not contain C, A, N, O, V.  
3. Places R in position 3 or 4.  
4. Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.  

Looking at common remaining consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out:  
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, U  

Let’s try to construct a word that fits these rules.  
A promising pattern is _ _ E R _ or _ E _ R _ or E _ _ R _ , etc., but R must be in 3 or 4.

One simple valid pattern is: E _ R _ _  
We can pick a consonant for position 2 and another for position 5.  
The word “ENTRY” comes to mind, but N and T are allowed?  
Wait: N is already ruled out (from CRANE).  
So “ENTRY” is invalid.

Another pattern: _ E R _ _  
We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
The word “FERNS” has N (invalid) and S is allowed, but N is out.  
“PERKY” has P, E, R, K, Y.  
Check:  
- Contains R and E → yes.  
- R is in position 3 → allowed.  
- E is in position 2 → allowed.  
- No C, A, N, O, V → yes.  

“PERKY” fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
P E R K Y  
- R is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

Looks good.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: PERKY -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

PERKY → P(x) E(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

1. E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
2. R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
3. Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
4. P and K are not in the word.

So the word has the fixed pattern: _ E R _ Y

Letters already ruled out from all previous feedback:
C, A, N, O, V, P, K

Remaining consonants to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z
Remaining vowels to consider: I, U (but position 1 and 4 can be either)

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z
- Position 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, S, T, W, X, Z

Looking for common English words that fit _ E R _ Y:

Possible candidates:
- BERRY (but B is allowed, R is already used in position 3, so this would have two R's - possible)
- FERRY (F is allowed)
- HERRY (not a valid word)
- LERRY (not a valid word)
- MERRY (M is allowed, two R's)
- TERRY (T is allowed)
- WERRY (not a valid word)

Among these, the most common valid words are: BERRY, FERRY, MERRY, TERRY

Let's check each:
- BERRY: B E R R Y - has two R's, which is allowed in Wordle
- FERRY: F E R R Y - has two R's
- MERRY: M E R R Y - has two R's
- TERRY: T E R R Y - has two R's

All fit the pattern. Since we have no additional constraints, any of these could be correct. The most common starting letter among these is likely 'T' for TERRY, but let's consider the frequency of starting letters.

However, we can also consider words with different letters. Are there any _ E R _ Y words without repeating R?

Looking again:
- S E R F Y (not a word)
- S E R V Y (V is ruled out)
- S E R A Y (A is ruled out)
- S E R I Y (not a word)
- S E R U Y (not a word)
- S E R D Y (D is allowed, but ""SERDY"" is not a word)
- S E R L Y (not a word)

It seems most valid _ E R _ Y words have double R. Therefore, the best next guess is to pick one of these common words. Among BERRY, FERRY, MERRY, TERRY, ""TERRY"" is a valid and common word.

But wait, let's double-check if any of these have ruled-out letters:
- BERRY: B, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- FERRY: F, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- MERRY: M, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters
- TERRY: T, E, R, R, Y - no ruled-out letters

All are valid. Since we have no further information, any of these could be correct. I'll choose ""TERRY"" as it's a common word.Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ E R _ Y with E in position 2, R in position 3, and Y in position 5. The letters P, K, C, A, N, O, V are not in the word. A common word fitting this pattern is:
