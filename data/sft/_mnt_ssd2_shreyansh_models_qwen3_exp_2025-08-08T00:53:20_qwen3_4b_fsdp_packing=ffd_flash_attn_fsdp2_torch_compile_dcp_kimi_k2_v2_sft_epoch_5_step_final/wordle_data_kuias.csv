### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, ideally without repeating any letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From all three guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, C, L, P  

Positions ruled out so far for each known letter:
- A: 1, 3, 4  
- S: 1, 4, 5  
- I: 4  

Therefore the only positions still allowed for each are:
- A: 2, 5  
- S: 2, 3  
- I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, I exactly once each (no repeats among them).
2. Places each of them only in the positions allowed above.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.

Remaining common, untested letters: D, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick scan of valid 5-letter words meeting these constraints yields “MISAD”:
- M (new letter) in 1 – allowed
- I (must be in 1,2,3,5) – here in 2 – allowed
- S (must be 2 or 3) – here in 3 – allowed
- A (must be 2 or 5) – here in 4 – wait, 4 is ruled out for A.  
So “MISAD” is invalid because A would sit in position 4.

Next candidate: “SADLY” – but L is already eliminated.

Next: “WISPY” – P is eliminated.

Next: “SIAUD” – not a recognized English word.

Next: “DISKA” – K and D are new, but A is in 5 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed).  
The sequence D I S K A uses only still-allowed letters and places each known letter in an allowed spot.  
“DISKA” is a valid 5-letter English word (a monetary unit in some countries).

So I will guess DISKA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, ideally without repeating any letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(x): O is not in the word at all
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but neither is in its current spot.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.
3. Positions 2, 3, 5 are still unknown.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, M, P, plus vowels I and U (since A is already known to be present, and E, O are out).

I want a word that:
- Has A and S in different positions
- Uses new letters to test
- Avoids R, O, E

A good candidate is ""STAIN"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- A moves from position 1 to 3
- Tests new letters T, I, N
- Avoids R, O, E

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (STAIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T and N are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we have:
Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N
Positions ruled out for each known letter:
- A: positions 1, 3
- S: positions 1, 4
- I: position 4

Remaining possible positions for each known letter:
- A: positions 2, 4, 5 (but not 1 or 3)
- S: positions 2, 3, 5 (but not 1 or 4)
- I: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)

We still need to test other common letters that haven't been used: C, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Uses A, S, I in new positions
2. Introduces new common letters
3. Avoids all ruled-out positions for the known letters
4. Avoids all letters we know are not in the word

A good candidate is ""CLASP"":
- C and L are new test letters
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (new letter)
- P is in position 5 (new letter)
This uses all three known letters in fresh positions and tests two new common consonants.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters, ideally without repeating any letters. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc. I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(x): O is not in the word at all
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S, but neither is in its current spot.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.
3. Positions 2, 3, 5 are still unknown.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, M, P, plus vowels I and U (since A is already known to be present, and E, O are out).

I want a word that:
- Has A and S in different positions
- Uses new letters to test
- Avoids R, O, E

A good candidate is ""STAIN"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- A moves from position 1 to 3
- Tests new letters T, I, N
- Avoids R, O, E

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

From Guess 2 (STAIN):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- T and N are NOT in the word.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we have:
Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N
Positions ruled out for each known letter:
- A: positions 1, 3
- S: positions 1, 4
- I: position 4

Remaining possible positions for each known letter:
- A: positions 2, 4, 5 (but not 1 or 3)
- S: positions 2, 3, 5 (but not 1 or 4)
- I: positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)

We still need to test other common letters that haven't been used: C, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Uses A, S, I in new positions
2. Introduces new common letters
3. Avoids all ruled-out positions for the known letters
4. Avoids all letters we know are not in the word

A good candidate is ""CLASP"":
- C and L are new test letters
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- S is in position 3 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (new letter)
- P is in position 5 (new letter)
This uses all three known letters in fresh positions and tests two new common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

From all three guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, C, L, P  

Positions ruled out so far for each known letter:
- A: 1, 3, 4  
- S: 1, 4, 5  
- I: 4  

Therefore the only positions still allowed for each are:
- A: 2, 5  
- S: 2, 3  
- I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, I exactly once each (no repeats among them).
2. Places each of them only in the positions allowed above.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.

Remaining common, untested letters: D, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick scan of valid 5-letter words meeting these constraints yields “MISAD”:
- M (new letter) in 1 – allowed
- I (must be in 1,2,3,5) – here in 2 – allowed
- S (must be 2 or 3) – here in 3 – allowed
- A (must be 2 or 5) – here in 4 – wait, 4 is ruled out for A.  
So “MISAD” is invalid because A would sit in position 4.

Next candidate: “SADLY” – but L is already eliminated.

Next: “WISPY” – P is eliminated.

Next: “SIAUD” – not a recognized English word.

Next: “DISKA” – K and D are new, but A is in 5 (allowed), I in 2 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed).  
The sequence D I S K A uses only still-allowed letters and places each known letter in an allowed spot.  
“DISKA” is a valid 5-letter English word (a monetary unit in some countries).

So I will guess DISKA.

From all four guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I  
Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, C, L, P, D, K  

Positions ruled out so far for each known letter:
- A: 1, 3, 4  
- S: 1, 4, 5  
- I: 4  

Therefore the only positions still allowed for each are:
- A: 2, 5  
- S: 2, 3  
- I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:

2. Places each of them only in the positions allowed above.
3. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated.

Remaining common, untested letters: G, H, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A valid 5-letter word that fits is “HUMAS”:
- H (new letter) in 1 – allowed (I can be in 1)
- U (new letter) in 2 – allowed
- M (new letter) in 3 – allowed
- A (must be 2 or 5) – here in 5 – allowed
- S (must be 2 or 3) – here in 3 – allowed

This satisfies every constraint.

From the feedback on HUMAS we now have:

So the word so far looks like: _ U _ A S

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from previous guesses): R, O, E, T, N, C, L, P, D, K, H, M

Remaining common letters to try in positions 1 and 3: G, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words matching the pattern _ U _ A S:
- GULAS (but L is eliminated)
- VULAS (L eliminated)
- JUGAS (J not common)
- BUGAS (B not yet eliminated, but let's see)
- FUGAS (F not yet eliminated)
- WUGAS (W not yet eliminated)

Looking at these, ""BUGAS"" seems plausible, but let's check if B is allowed - it hasn't been used or eliminated. Similarly, ""FUGAS"" with F.

However, ""FUGAS"" is a valid word (plural of fugus, though rare), and ""BUGAS"" is less common. 

Another option: ""JUGAS"" - but J is uncommon.

Looking at more common words: ""VULAS"" is not a common word, ""GULAS"" is not valid.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe ""V"" or ""W"" in position 1.

""VUGAS"" - not a word.

""WUGAS"" - not a word.

""GUGAS"" - repeats G, but G is allowed.

""GUGAS"" is valid (though uncommon).

""FUGAS"" is valid.

Another possibility: ""JUGAS"" as mentioned.

But considering commonality, ""FUGAS"" is the most plausible.

However, let's think of ""V"" in position 1 and ""G"" in position 3: V U G A S - ""VUGAS"" is not valid.
