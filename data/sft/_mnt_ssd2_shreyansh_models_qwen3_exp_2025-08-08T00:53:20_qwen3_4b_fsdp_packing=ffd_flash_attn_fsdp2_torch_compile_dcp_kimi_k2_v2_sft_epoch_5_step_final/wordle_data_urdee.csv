For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the 5th letter, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is already taken by E in CRANE but marked wrong).
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position.
2. Has E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Does not contain C, A, or N.

Possible candidates:
- TREAD (but A is excluded)
- BREED (but A is excluded)
- FRESH (but S is common and H is less common)
- GREET (but A is excluded)
- DREAD (but A is excluded)

Looking at these, ""TREND"" comes to mind:
- T R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, and no C, A, or N.
- However, ""TREED"" might be more likely (double E is possible).

But ""TREED"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. Instead, ""TREND"" uses E once and introduces new letters (T, D) that haven't been tested yet.

Actually, ""TREND"" is valid, but let me think of a better one. ""TROPE"" has O and P, which are new letters. But P is less common.

A better choice might be ""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so E cannot be in position 5). So this is invalid.

Next option: ""TREKS"":
- T R E K S: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This seems good.

But ""TREKS"" uses K and S, which are new. Another option: ""TREWS"":
- T R E W S: but W is less common.

I think ""TREKS"" is a solid choice.

Wait, let me reconsider. The feedback says E is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Looking for words with R in position 2 and E in 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _: ""ERASE"" (but A is excluded)
- _ R E _ _: ""BREAD"" (A excluded), ""DREAD"" (A excluded), ""TREAD"" (A excluded)
- _ R _ E _: ""BROKE"" (O, K, E), ""DROVE"" (O, V, E), ""TROPE"" (O, P, E)

""BROKE"" seems good:
- B R O K E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so this is invalid).

""DROVE"":
- D R O V E: E in position 5 again - invalid.

""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: same issue.

So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's try position 3:
- _ R E _ _: ""D R E A M"" (A excluded), ""F R E S H"", ""P R E S T"", ""B R E W S""

""FRISH"" (not a word), ""BREW S"" invalid. 

Looking at position 4:
- _ R _ E _: ""B R O K E"" (invalid), ""D R O V E"" (invalid), ""T R O V E"" (invalid).

Position 1:
- E R _ _ _: ""E R I D E"" (not common), ""E R U D E"" (but U is less common).

This is tricky. Let me try ""BREED"":
- B R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This is valid.

""BREED"" uses E twice, but it's a valid word and gives good info on E.

Another option: ""FRESH"":
- F R E S H: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This introduces S and H.

""FRESH"" seems better as it tests new letters (S, H) and has E in position 3.

Thus, my next guess is ""FRESH"".

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _
2. Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere else).
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, A, N, F, S, H.

Since E appeared in FRESH in position 3 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position), E cannot be in position 3.  
Also, E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “✓” in CRANE meant “in word but wrong position” (the symbol “✓” was used here to indicate “in word but wrong position”, because in standard Wordle the ✓ is actually for correct position; there seems to be a mix-up in the feedback provided. But re-reading the original rules: the feedback uses ✓ for correct position, - for in word wrong position, x for not in word. So in CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. In FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R).

We need a 5-letter word:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain E in position 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain: C, A, N, F, S, H.
- Other letters must be from remaining alphabet (B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Possible candidates:
  - B R O K E (but K is okay, O is okay) — but O and K haven’t been tested yet.
  - T R O V E — but V and O are okay, but E is in position 4 here? No, E is in position 4 only if word is _ R _ E _. So TR OVE is T R O V E which has E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R I D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - P R I Z E — Z is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R U D E — not a common word.
  - D R I V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - T R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R O K E — E in position 5 — invalid.

Hmm, seems like most common words with E in position 4 are not fitting. Let me try E in position 1:
- E R _ _ _
Possible candidates:
  - E R I D E — but E in position 5 again — invalid.
  - E R U D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - E R I K E — not common.
  - E R I C E — C is excluded.
  - E R I P E — P is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This suggests that E is more likely in position 4, but I’m not finding common words. Let me think differently: maybe E is in position 1. The word would be E R _ _ _. Let me list possible words:
- E R U D E — not valid (E in position 5).
- E R I D E — not valid.
- E R I K E — not valid.
- E R I P E — not valid.
- E R I S E — S is excluded.
- E R I T E — T is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — means E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me try position 4 again, but this time look for words with E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Letters allowed: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, A, N, F, S, H).

Possible words:
- B R O K E — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
- D R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- P R I Z E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- T R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- V R I E D — E in position 4 — this seems valid: V R I E D.

""VRIED"" is not a common English word, but ""VRIED"" is archaic for ""fried"". However, it's valid. But let me think of more common words.

Another option: ""B R I D E"" — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
""B R O D E"" — not a word.
""B R I P E"" — not a word.
""B R U D E"" — not a word.

This seems difficult. Let me try ""T R I E D"":
- T R I E D: E in position 4 — yes, this fits all criteria:
  - Pattern: _ R _ _ _
  - E in position 4.
  - No C, A, N, F, S, H.
  - Valid word.

Thus, ""TRIED"" is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_start|>assistant
For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the 5th letter, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is already taken by E in CRANE but marked wrong).
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position.
2. Has E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Does not contain C, A, or N.

Possible candidates:
- TREAD (but A is excluded)
- BREED (but A is excluded)
- FRESH (but S is common and H is less common)
- GREET (but A is excluded)
- DREAD (but A is excluded)

Looking at these, ""TREND"" comes to mind:
- T R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, and no C, A, or N.
- However, ""TREED"" might be more likely (double E is possible).

But ""TREED"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. Instead, ""TREND"" uses E once and introduces new letters (T, D) that haven't been tested yet.

Actually, ""TREND"" is valid, but let me think of a better one. ""TROPE"" has O and P, which are new letters. But P is less common.

A better choice might be ""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so E cannot be in position 5). So this is invalid.

Next option: ""TREKS"":
- T R E K S: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This seems good.

But ""TREKS"" uses K and S, which are new. Another option: ""TREWS"":
- T R E W S: but W is less common.

I think ""TREKS"" is a solid choice.

Wait, let me reconsider. The feedback says E is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Looking for words with R in position 2 and E in 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _: ""ERASE"" (but A is excluded)
- _ R E _ _: ""BREAD"" (A excluded), ""DREAD"" (A excluded), ""TREAD"" (A excluded)
- _ R _ E _: ""BROKE"" (O, K, E), ""DROVE"" (O, V, E), ""TROPE"" (O, P, E)

""BROKE"" seems good:
- B R O K E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so this is invalid).

""DROVE"":
- D R O V E: E in position 5 again - invalid.

""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: same issue.

So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's try position 3:
- _ R E _ _: ""D R E A M"" (A excluded), ""F R E S H"", ""P R E S T"", ""B R E W S""

""FRISH"" (not a word), ""BREW S"" invalid. 

Looking at position 4:
- _ R _ E _: ""B R O K E"" (invalid), ""D R O V E"" (invalid), ""T R O V E"" (invalid).

Position 1:
- E R _ _ _: ""E R I D E"" (not common), ""E R U D E"" (but U is less common).

This is tricky. Let me try ""BREED"":
- B R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This is valid.

""BREED"" uses E twice, but it's a valid word and gives good info on E.

Another option: ""FRESH"":
- F R E S H: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This introduces S and H.

""FRESH"" seems better as it tests new letters (S, H) and has E in position 3.

Thus, my next guess is ""FRESH"".

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _
2. Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere else).
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, A, N, F, S, H.

Since E appeared in FRESH in position 3 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position), E cannot be in position 3.  
Also, E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “✓” in CRANE meant “in word but wrong position” (the symbol “✓” was used here to indicate “in word but wrong position”, because in standard Wordle the ✓ is actually for correct position; there seems to be a mix-up in the feedback provided. But re-reading the original rules: the feedback uses ✓ for correct position, - for in word wrong position, x for not in word.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R).

We need a 5-letter word:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain E in position 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain: C, A, N, F, S, H.
- Other letters must be from remaining alphabet (B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Possible candidates:
  - B R O K E (but K is okay, O is okay) — but O and K haven’t been tested yet.
  - T R O V E — but V and O are okay, but E is in position 4 here? No, E is in position 4 only if word is _ R _ E _. So TR OVE is T R O V E which has E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R I D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - P R I Z E — Z is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R U D E — not a common word.
  - D R I V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - T R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R O K E — E in position 5 — invalid.

Hmm, seems like most common words with E in position 4 are not fitting. Let me try E in position 1:
- E R _ _ _
Possible candidates:
  - E R I D E — but E in position 5 again — invalid.
  - E R U D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - E R I K E — not common.
  - E R I C E — C is excluded.
  - E R I P E — P is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This suggests that E is more likely in position 4, but I’m not finding common words. Let me think differently: maybe E is in position 1. The word would be E R _ _ _. Let me list possible words:
- E R U D E — not valid (E in position 5).

- E R I K E — not valid.
- E R I P E — not valid.
- E R I S E — S is excluded.
- E R I T E — T is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — means E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me try position 4 again, but this time look for words with E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Letters allowed: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, A, N, F, S, H).

Possible words:
- B R O K E — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
- D R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- P R I Z E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- T R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- V R I E D — E in position 4 — this seems valid: V R I E D.

""VRIED"" is not a common English word, but ""VRIED"" is archaic for ""fried"". However, it's valid. But let me think of more common words.

Another option: ""B R I D E"" — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
""B R O D E"" — not a word.
""B R I P E"" — not a word.
""B R U D E"" — not a word.

- T R I E D: E in position 4 — yes, this fits all criteria:
  - Pattern: _ R _ _ _
  - E in position 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the 5th letter, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is already taken by E in CRANE but marked wrong).
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position.
2. Has E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Does not contain C, A, or N.

Possible candidates:
- TREAD (but A is excluded)
- BREED (but A is excluded)
- FRESH (but S is common and H is less common)
- GREET (but A is excluded)
- DREAD (but A is excluded)

Looking at these, ""TREND"" comes to mind:
- T R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, and no C, A, or N.
- However, ""TREED"" might be more likely (double E is possible).

But ""TREED"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. Instead, ""TREND"" uses E once and introduces new letters (T, D) that haven't been tested yet.

Actually, ""TREND"" is valid, but let me think of a better one. ""TROPE"" has O and P, which are new letters. But P is less common.

A better choice might be ""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so E cannot be in position 5). So this is invalid.

Next option: ""TREKS"":
- T R E K S: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This seems good.

But ""TREKS"" uses K and S, which are new. Another option: ""TREWS"":
- T R E W S: but W is less common.

I think ""TREKS"" is a solid choice.

Wait, let me reconsider. The feedback says E is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Looking for words with R in position 2 and E in 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _: ""ERASE"" (but A is excluded)
- _ R E _ _: ""BREAD"" (A excluded), ""DREAD"" (A excluded), ""TREAD"" (A excluded)
- _ R _ E _: ""BROKE"" (O, K, E), ""DROVE"" (O, V, E), ""TROPE"" (O, P, E)

""BROKE"" seems good:
- B R O K E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so this is invalid).

""DROVE"":
- D R O V E: E in position 5 again - invalid.

""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: same issue.

So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's try position 3:
- _ R E _ _: ""D R E A M"" (A excluded), ""F R E S H"", ""P R E S T"", ""B R E W S""

""FRISH"" (not a word), ""BREW S"" invalid. 

Looking at position 4:
- _ R _ E _: ""B R O K E"" (invalid), ""D R O V E"" (invalid), ""T R O V E"" (invalid).

Position 1:
- E R _ _ _: ""E R I D E"" (not common), ""E R U D E"" (but U is less common).

This is tricky. Let me try ""BREED"":
- B R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This is valid.

""BREED"" uses E twice, but it's a valid word and gives good info on E.

Another option: ""FRESH"":
- F R E S H: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This introduces S and H.

""FRESH"" seems better as it tests new letters (S, H) and has E in position 3.

Thus, my next guess is ""FRESH"".

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _
2. Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere else).
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, A, N, F, S, H.

Since E appeared in FRESH in position 3 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position), E cannot be in position 3.  
Also, E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “✓” in CRANE meant “in word but wrong position” (the symbol “✓” was used here to indicate “in word but wrong position”, because in standard Wordle the ✓ is actually for correct position; there seems to be a mix-up in the feedback provided. But re-reading the original rules: the feedback uses ✓ for correct position, - for in word wrong position, x for not in word. So in CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. In FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R).

We need a 5-letter word:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain E in position 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain: C, A, N, F, S, H.
- Other letters must be from remaining alphabet (B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Possible candidates:
  - B R O K E (but K is okay, O is okay) — but O and K haven’t been tested yet.
  - T R O V E — but V and O are okay, but E is in position 4 here? No, E is in position 4 only if word is _ R _ E _. So TR OVE is T R O V E which has E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R I D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - P R I Z E — Z is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R U D E — not a common word.
  - D R I V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - T R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R O K E — E in position 5 — invalid.

Hmm, seems like most common words with E in position 4 are not fitting. Let me try E in position 1:
- E R _ _ _
Possible candidates:
  - E R I D E — but E in position 5 again — invalid.
  - E R U D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - E R I K E — not common.
  - E R I C E — C is excluded.
  - E R I P E — P is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This suggests that E is more likely in position 4, but I’m not finding common words. Let me think differently: maybe E is in position 1. The word would be E R _ _ _. Let me list possible words:
- E R U D E — not valid (E in position 5).
- E R I D E — not valid.
- E R I K E — not valid.
- E R I P E — not valid.
- E R I S E — S is excluded.
- E R I T E — T is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — means E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me try position 4 again, but this time look for words with E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Letters allowed: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, A, N, F, S, H).

Possible words:
- B R O K E — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
- D R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- P R I Z E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- T R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- V R I E D — E in position 4 — this seems valid: V R I E D.

""VRIED"" is not a common English word, but ""VRIED"" is archaic for ""fried"". However, it's valid. But let me think of more common words.

Another option: ""B R I D E"" — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
""B R O D E"" — not a word.
""B R I P E"" — not a word.
""B R U D E"" — not a word.

This seems difficult. Let me try ""T R I E D"":
- T R I E D: E in position 4 — yes, this fits all criteria:
  - Pattern: _ R _ _ _
  - E in position 4.
  - No C, A, N, F, S, H.
  - Valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it contains common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), which should give me good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was the 5th letter, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- C, A, and N are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is already taken by E in CRANE but marked wrong).
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the second position.
2. Has E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Does not contain C, A, or N.

Possible candidates:
- TREAD (but A is excluded)
- BREED (but A is excluded)
- FRESH (but S is common and H is less common)
- GREET (but A is excluded)
- DREAD (but A is excluded)

Looking at these, ""TREND"" comes to mind:
- T R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, and no C, A, or N.
- However, ""TREED"" might be more likely (double E is possible).

But ""TREED"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. Instead, ""TREND"" uses E once and introduces new letters (T, D) that haven't been tested yet.

Actually, ""TREND"" is valid, but let me think of a better one. ""TROPE"" has O and P, which are new letters. But P is less common.

A better choice might be ""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so E cannot be in position 5). So this is invalid.

Next option: ""TREKS"":
- T R E K S: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This seems good.

But ""TREKS"" uses K and S, which are new. Another option: ""TREWS"":
- T R E W S: but W is less common.

I think ""TREKS"" is a solid choice.

Wait, let me reconsider. The feedback says E is in the word but wrong position (position 5), so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Looking for words with R in position 2 and E in 1, 3, or 4:
- E R _ _ _: ""ERASE"" (but A is excluded)
- _ R E _ _: ""BREAD"" (A excluded), ""DREAD"" (A excluded), ""TREAD"" (A excluded)
- _ R _ E _: ""BROKE"" (O, K, E), ""DROVE"" (O, V, E), ""TROPE"" (O, P, E)

""BROKE"" seems good:
- B R O K E: R in position 2, E in position 5 (but E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked wrong, so this is invalid).

""DROVE"":
- D R O V E: E in position 5 again - invalid.

""TROVE"":
- T R O V E: same issue.

So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's try position 3:
- _ R E _ _: ""D R E A M"" (A excluded), ""F R E S H"", ""P R E S T"", ""B R E W S""

""FRISH"" (not a word), ""BREW S"" invalid. 

Looking at position 4:
- _ R _ E _: ""B R O K E"" (invalid), ""D R O V E"" (invalid), ""T R O V E"" (invalid).

Position 1:
- E R _ _ _: ""E R I D E"" (not common), ""E R U D E"" (but U is less common).

This is tricky. Let me try ""BREED"":
- B R E E D: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This is valid.

""BREED"" uses E twice, but it's a valid word and gives good info on E.

Another option: ""FRESH"":
- F R E S H: R in position 2, E in position 3, no C, A, or N. This introduces S and H.

""FRESH"" seems better as it tests new letters (S, H) and has E in position 3.

Thus, my next guess is ""FRESH"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: FRESH -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ _ _
2. Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 2) and E (somewhere else).
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, A, N, F, S, H.

Since E appeared in FRESH in position 3 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong position), E cannot be in position 3.  
Also, E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “✓” in CRANE meant “in word but wrong position” (the symbol “✓” was used here to indicate “in word but wrong position”, because in standard Wordle the ✓ is actually for correct position; there seems to be a mix-up in the feedback provided. But re-reading the original rules: the feedback uses ✓ for correct position, - for in word wrong position, x for not in word. So in CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. In FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 2 is R).

We need a 5-letter word:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Must contain E in position 1 or 4.
- Must NOT contain: C, A, N, F, S, H.
- Other letters must be from remaining alphabet (B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Possible candidates:
  - B R O K E (but K is okay, O is okay) — but O and K haven’t been tested yet.
  - T R O V E — but V and O are okay, but E is in position 4 here? No, E is in position 4 only if word is _ R _ E _. So TR OVE is T R O V E which has E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R I D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - P R I Z E — Z is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R U D E — not a common word.
  - D R I V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - T R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - B R O K E — E in position 5 — invalid.

Hmm, seems like most common words with E in position 4 are not fitting. Let me try E in position 1:
- E R _ _ _
Possible candidates:
  - E R I D E — but E in position 5 again — invalid.
  - E R U D E — E in position 5 — invalid.
  - E R I K E — not common.
  - E R I C E — C is excluded.
  - E R I P E — P is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This suggests that E is more likely in position 4, but I’m not finding common words. Let me think differently: maybe E is in position 1. The word would be E R _ _ _. Let me list possible words:
- E R U D E — not valid (E in position 5).
- E R I D E — not valid.
- E R I K E — not valid.
- E R I P E — not valid.
- E R I S E — S is excluded.
- E R I T E — T is okay, but E in position 5 — invalid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-) — means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- FRESH: F(x) R(✓) E(-) S(x) H(x) — means E is in the word but not in position 3.

Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. Position 2 is R, so E must be in position 1 or 4.

Let me try position 4 again, but this time look for words with E in position 4:
- _ R _ E _
Letters allowed: B, D, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C, A, N, F, S, H).

Possible words:
- B R O K E — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
- D R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- P R I Z E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- T R O V E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- G R I P E — E in position 5 — invalid.
- V R I E D — E in position 4 — this seems valid: V R I E D.

""VRIED"" is not a common English word, but ""VRIED"" is archaic for ""fried"". However, it's valid. But let me think of more common words.

Another option: ""B R I D E"" — but E is in position 5 — invalid.
""B R O D E"" — not a word.
""B R I P E"" — not a word.
""B R U D E"" — not a word.

This seems difficult. Let me try ""T R I E D"":
- T R I E D: E in position 4 — yes, this fits all criteria:
  - Pattern: _ R _ _ _
  - E in position 4.
  - No C, A, N, F, S, H.
  - Valid word.

Thus, ""TRIED"" is a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Pattern so far: _ R _ E _  (because R is in position 2 and E is in position 4).
2. Letters confirmed in the word: R (position 2), E (position 4).
3. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: C, A, N, F, S, H, T, I, D.

That leaves the following available letters for positions 1 and 5:
B, G, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- Uses only the remaining letters for positions 1 and 5.
- Is a valid English word.

Looking at position 1 and 5:
Possible combinations:
- B R O E K  → “BROKE” (but D was marked “-” in TRIED, so K is allowed)
- B R O E M  → “BROEM” (not a word)
- B R O E D  → “BROED” (archaic, but valid)
- G R O E N  → “GROEN” (not common)
- G R O E B  → “GROEB” (not a word)
- V R O E N  → “VROEN” (not a word)
- P R O E M  → “PROEM” (valid)

“BROKE” is a common word and fits all constraints:
- B (position 1) is allowed.
- R (position 2) is correct.
- O (position 3) is allowed.
- E (position 4) is correct.
- K (position 5) was not excluded by any feedback.

Therefore, “BROKE” is the best next guess.

Current knowledge:

1. Fixed positions: _ R _ E _
2. Letters confirmed in word: R (pos 2), E (pos 4)
3. Letters confirmed NOT in word: C, A, N, F, S, H, T, I, D, B, O, K

Remaining usable letters for positions 1 and 5 (and position 3):
G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word fitting:
- Position 1: any of G, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: any of remaining letters
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: any of remaining letters

Scanning possibilities quickly, the only common word that fits is:
G R U E L  → “GRUEL” (G, R, U, E, L) — all letters are still allowed.

Let’s verify:
- G (pos 1) – allowed
- R (pos 2) – correct
- U (pos 3) – allowed
- E (pos 4) – correct
- L (pos 5) – allowed

“GRUEL” is a valid English word and fits every constraint.

But re-reading the original rules: the feedback uses ✓ for correct position, - for in word wrong position, x for not in word.

From the feedback so far we have:

Fixed positions:

- Position 4: E

So the pattern is: _ R _ E _

Letters known NOT in the word (×):
C, A, N, F, S, H, T, I, D, B, O, K, G, L

Letters still allowed for positions 1, 3, 5 (and not yet ruled out):
J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know:
- U is in the word but not in position 3 (from GRUEL feedback: U(-)).

Therefore:
- Position 3 cannot be U.
- U must appear in either position 1 or 5.

Possible words fitting _ R _ E _ with U in position 1 or 5, using only allowed letters:

1. U R _ E _  → UR*E*
