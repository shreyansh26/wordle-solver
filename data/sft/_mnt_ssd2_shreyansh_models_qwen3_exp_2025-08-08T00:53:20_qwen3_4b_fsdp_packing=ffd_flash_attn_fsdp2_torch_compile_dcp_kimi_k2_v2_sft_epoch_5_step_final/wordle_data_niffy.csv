For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or finding letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common ending letter
- E: most common vowel

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good positional spread.

The first guess “SLATE” got all five letters marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- The word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test the remaining 21 letters.

A good second guess should:
1. Use letters that have not been eliminated.
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Avoid repeating any of the already-ruled-out letters.

Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A balanced word that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “ROUND”:
- R, N, D (common consonants)
- O, U (common vowels)

This will give us new information about five fresh letters.

So far we have eliminated:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
N (cannot be in positions 3 or 4)  
I (cannot be in position 3)

Remaining common letters to test:  
B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
2. Contains both N and I (since we know both are in the word).
3. Places N in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. Places I in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (and not 3).

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try to place N and I in different positions and fill the remaining three slots with new letters.

One simple word that fits these constraints is “PINNY”:
- P, Y are new letters.
- N appears twice (positions 2 and 5), satisfying the “N is in the word” requirement.
- I appears once (position 3) – but we know I cannot be in position 3. So “PINNY” is invalid.

Another candidate: “MIXIN”
- M, X are new letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 4 – but we know N cannot be in position 4. So “MIXIN” is invalid.

Next candidate: “VINYL”
- V, L are new letters, but L is already eliminated. So invalid.

Next: “PINNY” already invalid.  
Next: “BINGO” – contains O, already eliminated.

Next: “FINGY”
- F, G, Y are new letters.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- N in position 3 – but N cannot be in position 3. Invalid.

Next: “PINKY”
- P, K, Y – K is eliminated. Invalid.

Next: “WIMPY”
- W, M, P, Y are new.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- N is missing. We need both I and N in the word. So invalid.

We must include **both** I and N. Let’s try “INBOX” – but O, B, X: O is eliminated.

Try “INLET” – E, T eliminated.

Try “INMUR” – U, R eliminated.

Try “INBOW” – O, W: O eliminated.

Try “INMIX” – M, X new.
- I in position 1 (allowed).
- N in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).
This fits all constraints.

So “INMIX”:
- Letters: I, N, M, X – all still allowed.
- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 1 (allowed).
- M and X are new tests.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or finding letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common ending letter
- E: most common vowel

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good positional spread.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The first guess “SLATE” got all five letters marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- The word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test the remaining 21 letters.

A good second guess should:
1. Use letters that have not been eliminated.
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Avoid repeating any of the already-ruled-out letters.

Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A balanced word that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “ROUND”:
- R, N, D (common consonants)
- O, U (common vowels)

This will give us new information about five fresh letters.

From the two guesses we now know:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D  
- The letter **N** is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains N (but not in position 4).
- Contains none of the letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.

Remaining common letters to test: I, C, G, H, K, M, P, Y, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
2. Places N somewhere other than position 4.
3. Introduces as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, K are all new letters.
- N is in position 3 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check for any conflicts: none of C, H, I, K, N are in the banned list, and N is not in position 4. So “CHINK” is valid.

Try “INBOW” – O, W: O eliminated.

Try “INMIX” – M, X new.
- I in position 1 (allowed).
- N in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).
This fits all constraints.

So “INMIX”:

- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 1 (allowed).
- M and X are new tests.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word (x in at least one guess):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K, M, X

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
I (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4)  
N (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)

Remaining letters that have **never** been guessed and are therefore still possible:  
B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains **both** I and N (since both are confirmed present).
2. Places I in position 2 or 5 (allowed positions).
3. Places N in position 1, 5 (allowed positions).
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters for the remaining slots.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Possible placements:
- I in position 2, N in position 1 → N I _ _ _
- I in position 2, N in position 5 → N _ _ _ I
- I in position 5, N in position 1 → N _ _ _ I
- I in position 5, N in position 5 → impossible (N and I must occupy different positions).

Let’s pick the first pattern: N I _ _ _

We need three more letters from the remaining pool {B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z}.

A common English word that fits N I _ _ _ is “NIGHT” – but G, H, T: H and T are eliminated.

Next: “NINNY” – N appears twice (positions 1 and 5), but we only know one N is required. Also Y is allowed.

However, “NINNY” has N in position 5 (allowed) and I in position 2 (allowed). The repeated N is acceptable since we only know one N exists, but the word could have two Ns. Still, this seems less likely.

Another candidate: “NIBBY” – B appears twice. N in position 1, I in position 2. B and Y are allowed.

“NIBBY” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- I: position 2 (allowed)
- B: new, allowed
- B: new, allowed
- Y: new, allowed

No conflicts with any previous feedback.

Therefore, “NIBBY” is a strong next guess.

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
I (cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4)  
N (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)

Remaining letters that have **never** been guessed and are therefore still possible:  
B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains **both** I and N (since both are confirmed present).
2. Places I in position 2 or 5 (allowed positions).
3. Places N in position 1, 5 (allowed positions).
4. Uses only the still-allowed letters for the remaining slots.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Possible placements:
- I in position 2, N in position 1 → N I _ _ _
- I in position 2, N in position 5 → N _ _ _ I
- I in position 5, N in position 1 → N _ _ _ I
- I in position 5, N in position 5 → impossible (N and I must occupy different positions).

Let’s pick the first pattern: N I _ _ _

We need three more letters from the remaining pool {B, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z}.

A common English word that fits N I _ _ _ is “NIGHT” – but G, H, T: H and T are eliminated.

Next: “NINNY” – N appears twice (positions 1 and 5), but we only know one N is required. Also Y is allowed.

However, “NINNY” has N in position 5 (allowed) and I in position 2 (allowed). The repeated N is acceptable since we only know one N exists, but the word could have two Ns. Still, this seems less likely.

Another candidate: “NIBBY” – B appears twice. N in position 1, I in position 2. B and Y are allowed.

“NIBBY” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s verify:
- N: position 1 (allowed)
- I: position 2 (allowed)
- B: new, allowed
- B: new, allowed
- Y: new, allowed

No conflicts with any previous feedback.

Therefore, “NIBBY” is a strong next guess.",Guess 5: NIBBY -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) I(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or finding letters that are in the word but in the wrong place.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common ending letter
- E: most common vowel

Both are strong, but I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers slightly more common letters and has a good positional spread.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The first guess “SLATE” got all five letters marked “x”, so none of S, L, A, T, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we now know:

- The word contains none of S, L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test the remaining 21 letters.

A good second guess should:
1. Use letters that have not been eliminated.
2. Include a mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Avoid repeating any of the already-ruled-out letters.

Popular remaining vowels: I, O, U  
Popular remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A balanced word that covers several fresh high-frequency letters is “ROUND”:
- R, N, D (common consonants)
- O, U (common vowels)

This will give us new information about five fresh letters.

From the two guesses we now know:

- Letters that are **not** in the word at all: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D  
- The letter **N** is in the word but **not** in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains N (but not in position 4).
- Contains none of the letters S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.

Remaining common letters to test: I, C, G, H, K, M, P, Y, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
2. Places N somewhere other than position 4.
3. Introduces as many new letters as possible.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, K are all new letters.
- N is in position 3 (not 4), satisfying the feedback.
- All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check for any conflicts: none of C, H, I, K, N are in the banned list, and N is not in position 4. So “CHINK” is valid.

So far we have eliminated:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
N (cannot be in positions 3 or 4)  
I (cannot be in position 3)

Remaining common letters to test:  
B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.
2. Contains both N and I (since we know both are in the word).
3. Places N in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
4. Places I in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (and not 3).

Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try to place N and I in different positions and fill the remaining three slots with new letters.

One simple word that fits these constraints is “PINNY”:
- P, Y are new letters.
- N appears twice (positions 2 and 5), satisfying the “N is in the word” requirement.
- I appears once (position 3) – but we know I cannot be in position 3. So “PINNY” is invalid.

Another candidate: “MIXIN”
- M, X are new letters.
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 4 – but we know N cannot be in position 4. So “MIXIN” is invalid.

Next candidate: “VINYL”
- V, L are new letters, but L is already eliminated. So invalid.

Next: “PINNY” already invalid.  
Next: “BINGO” – contains O, already eliminated.

Next: “FINGY”
- F, G, Y are new letters.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- N in position 3 – but N cannot be in position 3. Invalid.

Next: “PINKY”
- P, K, Y – K is eliminated. Invalid.

Next: “WIMPY”
- W, M, P, Y are new.
- I in position 2 (allowed).
- N is missing. We need both I and N in the word. So invalid.

We must include **both** I and N. Let’s try “INBOX” – but O, B, X: O is eliminated.

Try “INLET” – E, T eliminated.

Try “INMUR” – U, R eliminated.

Try “INBOW” – O, W: O eliminated.

Try “INMIX” – M, X new.
- I in position 1 (allowed).
- N in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).
This fits all constraints.

So “INMIX”:
- Letters: I, N, M, X – all still allowed.
- N is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 1 (allowed).
- M and X are new tests.

This seems like the best next guess.

From the latest feedback we now know:

1. N is in position 1 (✓).
2. I is in position 2 (✓).
3. Y is in position 5 (✓).
4. B is not in the word (x in positions 3 and 4).

So the word structure is: N I _ _ Y  
with positions 3 and 4 still unknown.

Letters already eliminated (x in at least one guess):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K, M, X, B

Remaining possible letters (never guessed and not yet ruled out):  
F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Z

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 3 and 4, forming a valid English word.

Possible combinations:  
- F, G → N I F G Y (no common word)  
- F, V → N I F V Y (invalid)  
- G, V → N I G V Y (invalid)  
- P, V → N I P V Y (invalid)  
- V, F → N I V F Y (invalid)  
- W, F → N I W F Y (invalid)  
- G, P → N I G P Y (invalid)  
- P, G → N I P G Y (invalid)  
- F, P → N I F P Y (invalid)  
- V, P → N I V P Y (invalid)  
- G, V → N I G V Y (invalid)  
- F, G → N I F G Y (invalid)  

The only valid English word fitting N I _ _ Y with these constraints is NINNY, but we already ruled out B and NINNY uses B (invalid). 

Wait, let's reconsider: we have N I _ _ Y and possible letters F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Looking at valid words:
- N I F F Y → ""NINNY"" but double F is possible.
- N I V E Y → but E is eliminated.
- N I G G Y → ""NIGGY"" but G is repeated and valid.
- N I V A Y → but A is eliminated.

Actually, ""NIGGY"" is a valid English word (slang for someone with a large nose) and uses N I G G Y. The letters G are from the allowed set and not yet used.

But we need to check if G has been used or eliminated: G has never been guessed, so it's allowed.

Thus, ""NIGGY"" fits the structure N I _ _ Y with allowed letters.

However, let's verify: N(✓) I(✓) G _ Y. Position 4 is G, which is allowed.

Another possible word: N I V E Y → but E is eliminated.

""NINNY"" uses B which is eliminated.

""NIGGY"" uses G twice, which is allowed since we only know one N exists, but the word could have two Gs.

But ""NIGGY"" is the only valid word fitting N I _ _ Y with allowed letters.

Wait, let's think of ""NINNY"" again: N I N N Y. This uses N in positions 1,3 and I in 2, Y in 5. But we know N is in position 1 and I in 2, but nothing prevents another N or I. However, B is eliminated, but N is allowed to repeat.

But ""NINNY"" is a valid word and uses N I N N Y. The letters N, I, Y are confirmed, and the second N and second I are allowed since we have no info against them.

But we have to use the confirmed positions: N in 1, I in 2, Y in 5, and fill 3 and 4 with allowed letters.

""NINNY"" would be N I N N Y → positions 3 and 4 are N and N. N has not been eliminated, so this is possible.

But is there a more straightforward word? ""NIGGY"" seems similar.

Actually, ""NINNY"" is the more common word.

But let's check if ""NINNY"" has been considered: yes, but B is eliminated, not N.

""NINNY"" uses N I N N Y → positions 3 and 4 are N and N. This is acceptable.

But let's see if there's another word: N I P P Y → ""NIPPY"" (valid, means frisky) → uses P twice, P is allowed.

""NIPPY"" seems like a good choice.

Let's verify: N(✓) I(✓) P P Y. P is from the allowed set and not used yet.

Thus, ""NIPPY"" fits perfectly.

<guess>NIPPY</guess>",NIPPY,"From the latest feedback we now know:

1. N is in position 1 (✓).
2. I is in position 2 (✓).
3. Y is in position 5 (✓).
4. B is not in the word (x in positions 3 and 4).

So the word structure is: N I _ _ Y  
with positions 3 and 4 still unknown.

Letters already eliminated (x in at least one guess):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K, M, X, B

Remaining possible letters (never guessed and not yet ruled out):  
F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Z

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 3 and 4, forming a valid English word.

Possible combinations:  
- F, G → N I F G Y (no common word)  
- F, V → N I F V Y (invalid)  
- G, V → N I G V Y (invalid)  
- P, V → N I P V Y (invalid)  
- V, F → N I V F Y (invalid)  
- W, F → N I W F Y (invalid)  
- G, P → N I G P Y (invalid)  
- P, G → N I P G Y (invalid)  
- F, P → N I F P Y (invalid)  
- V, P → N I V P Y (invalid)  
- G, V → N I G V Y (invalid)  
- F, G → N I F G Y (invalid)  

The only valid English word fitting N I _ _ Y with these constraints is NINNY, but we already ruled out B and NINNY uses B (invalid). 

Wait, let's reconsider: we have N I _ _ Y and possible letters F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Z.

Looking at valid words:
- N I F F Y → ""NINNY"" but double F is possible.
- N I V E Y → but E is eliminated.
- N I G G Y → ""NIGGY"" but G is repeated and valid.
- N I V A Y → but A is eliminated.

Actually, ""NIGGY"" is a valid English word (slang for someone with a large nose) and uses N I G G Y. The letters G are from the allowed set and not yet used.

But we need to check if G has been used or eliminated: G has never been guessed, so it's allowed.

Thus, ""NIGGY"" fits the structure N I _ _ Y with allowed letters.

However, let's verify: N(✓) I(✓) G _ Y. Position 4 is G, which is allowed.

Another possible word: N I V E Y → but E is eliminated.

""NINNY"" uses B which is eliminated.

""NIGGY"" uses G twice, which is allowed since we only know one N exists, but the word could have two Gs.

But ""NIGGY"" is the only valid word fitting N I _ _ Y with allowed letters.

Wait, let's think of ""NINNY"" again: N I N N Y. This uses N in positions 1,3 and I in 2, Y in 5. But we know N is in position 1 and I in 2, but nothing prevents another N or I. However, B is eliminated, but N is allowed to repeat.

But ""NINNY"" is a valid word and uses N I N N Y. The letters N, I, Y are confirmed, and the second N and second I are allowed since we have no info against them.

But we have to use the confirmed positions: N in 1, I in 2, Y in 5, and fill 3 and 4 with allowed letters.

""NINNY"" would be N I N N Y → positions 3 and 4 are N and N. N has not been eliminated, so this is possible.

But is there a more straightforward word? ""NIGGY"" seems similar.

But let's check if ""NINNY"" has been considered: yes, but B is eliminated, not N.

""NINNY"" uses N I N N Y → positions 3 and 4 are N and N. This is acceptable.

But let's see if there's another word: N I P P Y → ""NIPPY"" (valid, means frisky) → uses P twice, P is allowed.

""NIPPY"" seems like a good choice.

Let's verify: N(✓) I(✓) P P Y. P is from the allowed set and not used yet.
