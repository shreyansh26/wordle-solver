For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The best strategy is to use a word with five different common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would include several of these. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Common remaining letters: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let me try a word with S plus some of these letters. A good candidate is ""SUNTIL"" but that's 6 letters. ""SUNNY"" has two Ns and a Y, but Y is less common. ""SLUMP"" has S and L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

Another good option is ""SINUS"" but it repeats S twice and has S in position 4 which we know is wrong.

""STING"" has S, T, I, N, G - all new letters except S. S is in position 1 here, which is fine since we know it's not in position 4.

""STING"" seems like a strong second guess to test T, I, N, G while keeping S in a new position.

Let’s list what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out (x):  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, H, P

Letters confirmed in the word:  
C (✓) – in position 1  
S (from both guesses 1 and 2) – in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4  
U (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 3  
M (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the secret word looks like:  
C _ _ _ _  
with S, U, M somewhere among positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and S cannot be in 4.

Letters still available (not yet tested):  
B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-known S, U, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with C  
- contains S, U, M in allowable positions  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:  
C S U M _  (but S cannot be in 2 and U in 3 at the same time)  
C _ S _ U  
C _ _ S _  
C _ U _ S  
C _ _ _ U with S and M placed appropriately

Let’s try to place the letters systematically.

Option 1: C S _ _ _  
Then U and M must fit in positions 3, 4, 5.  
Possible word: C S U M _ → need a 5th letter (not yet used).  
CSUM_ – the only common word is “CSUM” + ?, but no valid 5-letter word starts CSUM.

Option 2: C _ S _ _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C U S M _ → “CUSMX” – invalid.  
C L S U M – but L hasn’t been tested and is allowed.  
Wait, C L S U M – positions: C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5).  
Check constraints:  
- C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
- S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 3 – OK  
- U not in 3 – here U is in 4 – OK  
- M not in 4 – here M is in 5 – OK  
- All letters used (C, L, S, U, M) are allowed so far.  
- “CLSUM” is not a valid English word.  

Option 3: C _ _ S _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 4: C _ _ _ S  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
Try C U M _ S – “CUM_S” – need a 4th letter.  
C U M B S – “CUMBS” – not a word.  
C U M L S – “CUMLS” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 5: C _ U _ _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C S U M _ – invalid as above.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 6: C _ _ U _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C S _ U _ – “CS_U_” – need letters.  
C S L U M – “CSULM” – invalid.  

Option 7: C _ U _ S  
Then M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 8: C _ _ U S  
Then S is in 5 – allowed.  
M and the other letter must fit in 2, 3.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s think of actual English words that start with C and contain S, U, M, excluding the ruled-out letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters:

- CUMUL (but has two U’s, and we only know one U exists)  
- CLUMP – but P is ruled out.  
- CLUCK – C, L, U, C, K – but C is already in position 1 and we don’t know if it repeats. Also P is out.  
- CUBIC – B and I are allowed? I is ruled out.  
- CULMS – C, U, L, M, S – positions: C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
  Check constraints:  
  - C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
  - S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 5 – OK  
  - U not in 3 – here U is in 2 – OK  
  - M not in 4 – here M is in 4 – **invalid** (M cannot be in 4).  

Next word: MULCH – but starts with M, not C.  
CUSPS – starts with C, has S, U, S, P – P is out.  
CUSKS – K is allowed, but only 3 letters used (C, U, S, K, S) – but we need to use M.  

We must include C, S, U, M.  
Let’s try to find a word with C, S, U, M plus one more allowed letter.

Possible combinations:  
C S U M B – “CSUMB” – invalid.  
C S U M D – “CSUMD” – invalid.  
C S U M L – “CSUML” – invalid.  
C S U M Y – “CSUMY” – invalid.  

Wait, maybe the word has C, S, U, M and one more letter, but not necessarily in that order.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, no ruled-out letters.

Looking up, a valid word is “CUSPY” – but P is out.  
“CLUMP” – P is out.  
“CUMIN” – N is out.  
“CUMUL” – double U, but U is allowed once.  
“CUMUL” is a word (archaic for heap), but has two U’s.  

Another valid word: “CLUCK” – but has C twice and K, and we don’t know about repeats.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
M is in 4 – but feedback said M is NOT in 4. So invalid.  

Next: “SMUCK” – starts with S, not C.  

Realizing we might have missed a letter: the word must have C, S, U, M and one more letter not yet used.  

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

A valid word: “CUMBO” – but O is out.  
“CUMUL” – two U’s, but only one U is confirmed.  

Another word: “CUBMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again but swap L with another letter:  
C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  

Realizing we might need to use a less common word: “CUSPS” – but P is out.  

Going back to the constraints:  
C _ _ _ _  
S must be in 2, 3, or 5  
U must be in 2, 4, or 5  
M must be in 2, 3, 5  

Let’s try:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) M(4) S(5) – but M cannot be in 4.  
C(1) L(2) M(3) U(4) S(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 5 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- L is allowed – OK  
Word: “CLMUS” – not valid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) M(3) S(4) _ – but S cannot be in 4.  
C(1) U(2) S(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) U(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) M(3) U(4) _ – valid positions:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 2 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- need a 5th letter not yet used.  
Word: “CSM_U” – “CSMUL” – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) S(3) U(4) _ – same issue.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) U(3) S(4) _ – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 5 – OK  
- L in 2 – OK  
Word: “CLSUM” – not valid.  

Realizing we need to use a valid English word:  
After checking, the only valid 5-letter word starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters is “CUMUL”.  
Even though it has two U’s, one U is confirmed in the word, and the second U is possible.  

Thus, “CUMUL” is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The best strategy is to use a word with five different common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would include several of these. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Common remaining letters: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let me try a word with S plus some of these letters. A good candidate is ""SUNTIL"" but that's 6 letters. ""SUNNY"" has two Ns and a Y, but Y is less common. ""SLUMP"" has S and L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

Another good option is ""SINUS"" but it repeats S twice and has S in position 4 which we know is wrong.

""STING"" has S, T, I, N, G - all new letters except S. S is in position 1 here, which is fine since we know it's not in position 4.

""STING"" seems like a strong second guess to test T, I, N, G while keeping S in a new position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – T, I, N, G are NOT in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
S (and it is NOT in positions 1 or 4)

Remaining common letters to test:  
B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S exactly once, and S is in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out)  
- uses only letters from the “still possible” set above  
- preferably tests several new letters at once.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints gives “PLUSH”:
- P, L, U, H are all untested.  
- S is in position 4 → but we already know S is not in position 4 from guess 1. So “PLUSH” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CHUMP”  
- C, H, U, M, P are all untested.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

Therefore, “CHUMP” is a valid and informative next guess.

Let’s list what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out (x):  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, H, P

Letters confirmed in the word:  
C (✓) – in position 1  
S (from both guesses 1 and 2) – in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4  
U (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 3  
M (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the secret word looks like:  
C _ _ _ _  
with S, U, M somewhere among positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and S cannot be in 4.

Letters still available (not yet tested):  
B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-known S, U, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with C  
- contains S, U, M in allowable positions  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:  
C S U M _  (but S cannot be in 2 and U in 3 at the same time)  
C _ S _ U  
C _ _ S _  
C _ U _ S  
C _ _ _ U with S and M placed appropriately

Let’s try to place the letters systematically.

Option 1: C S _ _ _  
Then U and M must fit in positions 3, 4, 5.  
Possible word: C S U M _ → need a 5th letter (not yet used).  
CSUM_ – the only common word is “CSUM” + ?, but no valid 5-letter word starts CSUM.

Option 2: C _ S _ _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C U S M _ → “CUSMX” – invalid.  
C L S U M – but L hasn’t been tested and is allowed.  
Wait, C L S U M – positions: C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5).  
Check constraints:  
- C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
- S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 3 – OK  
- U not in 3 – here U is in 4 – OK  
- M not in 4 – here M is in 5 – OK  
- All letters used (C, L, S, U, M) are allowed so far.  
- “CLSUM” is not a valid English word.  

Option 3: C _ _ S _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 4: C _ _ _ S  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
Try C U M _ S – “CUM_S” – need a 4th letter.  
C U M B S – “CUMBS” – not a word.  
C U M L S – “CUMLS” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 5: C _ U _ _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C S U M _ – invalid as above.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 6: C _ _ U _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C S _ U _ – “CS_U_” – need letters.  
C S L U M – “CSULM” – invalid.  

Option 7: C _ U _ S  
Then M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 8: C _ _ U S  
Then S is in 5 – allowed.  
M and the other letter must fit in 2, 3.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s think of actual English words that start with C and contain S, U, M, excluding the ruled-out letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters:

- CUMUL (but has two U’s, and we only know one U exists)  
- CLUMP – but P is ruled out.  
- CLUCK – C, L, U, C, K – but C is already in position 1 and we don’t know if it repeats. Also P is out.  
- CUBIC – B and I are allowed? I is ruled out.  
- CULMS – C, U, L, M, S – positions: C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
  Check constraints:  
  - C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
  - S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 5 – OK  
  - U not in 3 – here U is in 2 – OK  
  - M not in 4 – here M is in 4 – **invalid** (M cannot be in 4).  

Next word: MULCH – but starts with M, not C.  
CUSPS – starts with C, has S, U, S, P – P is out.  
CUSKS – K is allowed, but only 3 letters used (C, U, S, K, S) – but we need to use M.  

We must include C, S, U, M.  
Let’s try to find a word with C, S, U, M plus one more allowed letter.

Possible combinations:  
C S U M B – “CSUMB” – invalid.  
C S U M D – “CSUMD” – invalid.  
C S U M L – “CSUML” – invalid.  
C S U M Y – “CSUMY” – invalid.  

Wait, maybe the word has C, S, U, M and one more letter, but not necessarily in that order.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, no ruled-out letters.

Looking up, a valid word is “CUSPY” – but P is out.  
“CLUMP” – P is out.  
“CUMIN” – N is out.  
“CUMUL” – double U, but U is allowed once.  
“CUMUL” is a word (archaic for heap), but has two U’s.  

Another valid word: “CLUCK” – but has C twice and K, and we don’t know about repeats.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
M is in 4 – but feedback said M is NOT in 4. So invalid.  

Next: “SMUCK” – starts with S, not C.  

Realizing we might have missed a letter: the word must have C, S, U, M and one more letter not yet used.  

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

A valid word: “CUMBO” – but O is out.  
“CUMUL” – two U’s, but only one U is confirmed.  

Another word: “CUBMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again but swap L with another letter:  
C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  

Realizing we might need to use a less common word: “CUSPS” – but P is out.  

Going back to the constraints:  
C _ _ _ _  
S must be in 2, 3, or 5  
U must be in 2, 4, or 5  
M must be in 2, 3, 5  

Let’s try:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) M(4) S(5) – but M cannot be in 4.  
C(1) L(2) M(3) U(4) S(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 5 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- L is allowed – OK  
Word: “CLMUS” – not valid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) M(3) S(4) _ – but S cannot be in 4.  
C(1) U(2) S(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) U(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) M(3) U(4) _ – valid positions:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 2 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- need a 5th letter not yet used.  
Word: “CSM_U” – “CSMUL” – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) S(3) U(4) _ – same issue.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) U(3) S(4) _ – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 5 – OK  
- L in 2 – OK  
Word: “CLSUM” – not valid.  

Realizing we need to use a valid English word:  
After checking, the only valid 5-letter word starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters is “CUMUL”.  
Even though it has two U’s, one U is confirmed in the word, and the second U is possible.  

Thus, “CUMUL” is the best next guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information about the secret word. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The best strategy is to use a word with five different common letters to maximize the chance of hitting letters in the secret word.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word would include several of these. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", etc.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives me a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Common remaining letters: T, I, N, L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let me try a word with S plus some of these letters. A good candidate is ""SUNTIL"" but that's 6 letters. ""SUNNY"" has two Ns and a Y, but Y is less common. ""SLUMP"" has S and L, U, M, P - but U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

Another good option is ""SINUS"" but it repeats S twice and has S in position 4 which we know is wrong.

""STING"" has S, T, I, N, G - all new letters except S. S is in position 1 here, which is fine since we know it's not in position 4.

""STING"" seems like a strong second guess to test T, I, N, G while keeping S in a new position.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   – S is in the word, but not in position 1.  
   – T, I, N, G are NOT in the word.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
S (and it is NOT in positions 1 or 4)

Remaining common letters to test:  
B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains S exactly once, and S is in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out)  
- uses only letters from the “still possible” set above  
- preferably tests several new letters at once.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting these constraints gives “PLUSH”:
- P, L, U, H are all untested.  
- S is in position 4 → but we already know S is not in position 4 from guess 1. So “PLUSH” is invalid.

Next candidate: “CHUMP”  
- C, H, U, M, P are all untested.  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

Therefore, “CHUMP” is a valid and informative next guess.

Let’s list what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out (x):  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, H, P

Letters confirmed in the word:  
C (✓) – in position 1  
S (from both guesses 1 and 2) – in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4  
U (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 3  
M (from guess 3) – in the word but NOT in position 4  

So the secret word looks like:  
C _ _ _ _  
with S, U, M somewhere among positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and S cannot be in 4.

Letters still available (not yet tested):  
B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the already-known S, U, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with C  
- contains S, U, M in allowable positions  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:  
C S U M _  (but S cannot be in 2 and U in 3 at the same time)  
C _ S _ U  
C _ _ S _  
C _ U _ S  
C _ _ _ U with S and M placed appropriately

Let’s try to place the letters systematically.

Option 1: C S _ _ _  
Then U and M must fit in positions 3, 4, 5.  
Possible word: C S U M _ → need a 5th letter (not yet used).  
CSUM_ – the only common word is “CSUM” + ?, but no valid 5-letter word starts CSUM.

Option 2: C _ S _ _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C U S M _ → “CUSMX” – invalid.  
C L S U M – but L hasn’t been tested and is allowed.  
Wait, C L S U M – positions: C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5).  
Check constraints:  
- C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
- S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 3 – OK  
- U not in 3 – here U is in 4 – OK  
- M not in 4 – here M is in 5 – OK  
- All letters used (C, L, S, U, M) are allowed so far.  
- “CLSUM” is not a valid English word.  

Option 3: C _ _ S _  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 4: C _ _ _ S  
Then U and M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
Try C U M _ S – “CUM_S” – need a 4th letter.  
C U M B S – “CUMBS” – not a word.  
C U M L S – “CUMLS” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 5: C _ U _ _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 4, 5.  
Try C S U M _ – invalid as above.  
C M U S _ – “CMUSX” – invalid.  

Option 6: C _ _ U _  
Then S and M must fit in 2, 3, 5.  
Try C S _ U _ – “CS_U_” – need letters.  
C S L U M – “CSULM” – invalid.  

Option 7: C _ U _ S  
Then M must fit in 2, 3, 4.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Option 8: C _ _ U S  
Then S is in 5 – allowed.  
M and the other letter must fit in 2, 3.  
C M U _ S – “CMUS_” – invalid.  
C L U M S – “CLUMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s think of actual English words that start with C and contain S, U, M, excluding the ruled-out letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters:

- CUMUL (but has two U’s, and we only know one U exists)  
- CLUMP – but P is ruled out.  
- CLUCK – C, L, U, C, K – but C is already in position 1 and we don’t know if it repeats. Also P is out.  
- CUBIC – B and I are allowed? I is ruled out.  
- CULMS – C, U, L, M, S – positions: C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
  Check constraints:  
  - C ✓ (position 1) – OK  
  - S not in 1 or 4 – here S is in 5 – OK  
  - U not in 3 – here U is in 2 – OK  
  - M not in 4 – here M is in 4 – **invalid** (M cannot be in 4).  

Next word: MULCH – but starts with M, not C.  
CUSPS – starts with C, has S, U, S, P – P is out.  
CUSKS – K is allowed, but only 3 letters used (C, U, S, K, S) – but we need to use M.  

We must include C, S, U, M.  
Let’s try to find a word with C, S, U, M plus one more allowed letter.

Possible combinations:  
C S U M B – “CSUMB” – invalid.  
C S U M D – “CSUMD” – invalid.  
C S U M L – “CSUML” – invalid.  
C S U M Y – “CSUMY” – invalid.  

Wait, maybe the word has C, S, U, M and one more letter, but not necessarily in that order.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words starting with C, containing S, U, M, no ruled-out letters.

Looking up, a valid word is “CUSPY” – but P is out.  
“CLUMP” – P is out.  
“CUMIN” – N is out.  
“CUMUL” – double U, but U is allowed once.  
“CUMUL” is a word (archaic for heap), but has two U’s.  

Another valid word: “CLUCK” – but has C twice and K, and we don’t know about repeats.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) M(4) S(5)  
M is in 4 – but feedback said M is NOT in 4. So invalid.  

Next: “SMUCK” – starts with S, not C.  

Realizing we might have missed a letter: the word must have C, S, U, M and one more letter not yet used.  

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

A valid word: “CUMBO” – but O is out.  
“CUMUL” – two U’s, but only one U is confirmed.  

Another word: “CUBMS” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “CULMS” again but swap L with another letter:  
C U M S _ – “CUMSX” – invalid.  

Realizing we might need to use a less common word: “CUSPS” – but P is out.  

Going back to the constraints:  
C _ _ _ _  
S must be in 2, 3, or 5  
U must be in 2, 4, or 5  
M must be in 2, 3, 5  

Let’s try:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) M(4) S(5) – but M cannot be in 4.  
C(1) L(2) M(3) U(4) S(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 5 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- L is allowed – OK  
Word: “CLMUS” – not valid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) M(3) S(4) _ – but S cannot be in 4.  
C(1) U(2) S(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) U(3) M(4) _ – M cannot be in 4.  

Next:  
C(1) S(2) M(3) U(4) _ – valid positions:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 2 – OK  
- M in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- need a 5th letter not yet used.  
Word: “CSM_U” – “CSMUL” – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) S(3) U(4) _ – same issue.  

Next:  
C(1) M(2) U(3) S(4) _ – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) U(2) L(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) U(3) S(4) M(5) – S in 4 – invalid.  

Next:  
C(1) L(2) S(3) U(4) M(5) – check:  
- C ✓ (1) – OK  
- S in 3 – OK  
- U in 4 – OK  
- M in 5 – OK  
- L in 2 – OK  
Word: “CLSUM” – not valid.  

Realizing we need to use a valid English word:  
After checking, the only valid 5-letter word starting with C, containing S, U, M, and no ruled-out letters is “CUMUL”.  
Even though it has two U’s, one U is confirmed in the word, and the second U is possible.  

Thus, “CUMUL” is the best next guess.
