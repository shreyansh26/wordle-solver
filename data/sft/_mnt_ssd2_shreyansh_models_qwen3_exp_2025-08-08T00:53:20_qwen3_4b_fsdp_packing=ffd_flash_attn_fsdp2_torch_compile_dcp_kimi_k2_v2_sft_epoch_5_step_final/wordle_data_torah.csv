- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal useful information about the secret word.

A balanced word that incorporates R and A in new spots and adds fresh common letters is “STRAW”:
- S, T, L are new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.

This should give us new information while respecting the constraints.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, E, S, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position 3), A (position 4), T (somewhere else).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Contains T somewhere (but not in position 2, since that’s where it was in STRAW).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for T: 1 or 5 (since 2 is wrong, 3 and 4 are already R and A).

Let’s try a word that places T in position 1: “TRADE”.
- T in position 1 (new position).
- R in position 3 (matches ✓).
- A in position 4 (matches ✓).
- D and E: E is already ruled out (from CRANE), so this won’t work.

Next option: “TAROK” – but K hasn’t been tested yet, and O hasn’t either, but we have no constraints on them. However, we should prefer common letters.

Better choice: “TAROT” – but O and T are repeated, and we only know T must appear once (since it was marked as “-” in STRAW, implying it’s not doubled).

Another candidate: “TURBO” – but B and O are new, and we don’t know about them yet.

A safer choice is “TARPS” – but S is ruled out.

Let's carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: C, N, E
   - Letters in word but wrong position: R (not position 2), A (not position 3)

2. STRAW → S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: S, W (added to C, N, E)
   - T is in word but wrong position (was in position 2)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)
   - A is in position 4 (✓)

3. TRAIL → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
   - T is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
   - R is in word but wrong position (was in position 3, now must be elsewhere)
   - A is in word but wrong position (was in position 4, now must be elsewhere)
   - I and L are NOT in word (added to previous exclusions)

So the secret word must:
- Start with T (position 1 confirmed)
- Have R somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5 since 3 is now wrong for R)
- Have A somewhere (positions 2 or 5 since 3 and 4 are wrong for A)
- Use only letters not yet ruled out: allowed letters are all others except C, N, E, S, W, I, L

We need a 5-letter word of the form T _ _ _ _ that contains both R and A, with R not in position 3 and A not in position 4.

Possible positions for R: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 2
   Then A must be in position 5 (since 2 is taken by R)
   Word structure: T R _ _ A

Case 2: R in position 4
   Then A must be in position 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R (but A not in 4, so 2 or 5)

Case 3: R in position 5
   Then A must be in position 2
   Structure: T A _ _ R

Now, let's find common 5-letter words fitting these patterns using allowed letters (no C, N, E, S, W, I, L).

For Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (but V not tested, A repeats)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (O, N, A - but N is excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

For Case 3: T A _ _ R
   Possible: T A B E R (E excluded)
   T A M A R (M, A not tested)
   T A M I R (I excluded)
   T A M O R (O, M not tested)
   T A M U R (U, M not tested)
   T A M P R (P not tested)
   T A M B R (B not tested)

The most promising seems ""TAMAR"" (but A repeats which might be allowed) or ""TRAMA"" (but A repeats).

Looking for common words: ""TAMAR"" isn't common, but ""TRAMA"" isn't either. ""TAMAR"" is a name, but valid word.

Another candidate: ""TURBA"" - but B not tested, U not tested, A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid (R must not be in 3).

Wait, let's re-examine Case 2: R in 4, A in 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R
   For T A _ R _:
      T A B R _ (B, _)
      T A M R _ (M, _)
   For T _ A _ R:
      T O A R _ (O, _)
      T U A R _ (U, _)

Looking at common words: ""TOAR_"" doesn't seem valid. ""TUAR_"" doesn't seem valid.

Actually, ""TURBO"" comes to mind, but:
   T(1) U(?) R(?) B(?) O(?)
   R is in 3 which is invalid (from TRAIL feedback R was in 3 and marked wrong)
   So TURBO is invalid.

Next: ""TAROK"" - but K not tested, O not tested, positions:
   T(1) A(2) R(3) - but R cannot be in 3 (from TRAIL feedback)
   So invalid.

Next: ""TAPIR"" - but I is excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" - O and T repeat, but T is already in 1.

Next: ""TARPS"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TAROC"" - C excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" already considered.

Next: ""TAROK"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" - Q not tested, but A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURIA"" - I excluded.

Next: ""TURBO"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURRA"" - R repeats, but R could be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURSA"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURBO"" invalid.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Let me re-examine Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (V not tested)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (N excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

""TRAVA"" is a word (Italian for ""to work""), but might be obscure.

""TRAMA"" is a word (plural of trama in Spanish/Italian, meaning story).

""TRADA"" is a word (type of fishing net).

""TRUDA"" is a word (name).

Among these, ""TRAMA"" seems the most plausible common word.

But let's check if it fits:
   T(1) R(2) A(5)
   R is in position 2 (new position, allowed since R was not in 2 before)
   A is in position 5 (new position, allowed since A was not in 5 before)
   Letters used: T, R, A, M
   M is new and allowed.

Thus, ""TRAMA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TRAVA"" - V is new, but less common.

Thus, I'll go with TRAMA.

Based on the updated constraints:
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- R must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- A must be in positions 2 or 5 (not 3 or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L.

The word ""TRAMA"" fits:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal useful information about the secret word.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C and N are NOT in the word (x).
- R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, N, or E.
- Contains R and A, but R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids C, N, and E.

Good new letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that incorporates R and A in new spots and adds fresh common letters is “STRAW”:
- S, T, L are new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.
- A moves from position 3 to 2.

This should give us new information while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STRAW -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STRAW:
- S and W are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- A is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓).

So the secret word is now known to look like:
_ _ R A _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, E, S, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position 3), A (position 4), T (somewhere else).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Contains T somewhere (but not in position 2, since that’s where it was in STRAW).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for T: 1 or 5 (since 2 is wrong, 3 and 4 are already R and A).

Let’s try a word that places T in position 1: “TRADE”.
- T in position 1 (new position).
- R in position 3 (matches ✓).
- A in position 4 (matches ✓).
- D and E: E is already ruled out (from CRANE), so this won’t work.

Next option: “TAROK” – but K hasn’t been tested yet, and O hasn’t either, but we have no constraints on them. However, we should prefer common letters.

Better choice: “TAROT” – but O and T are repeated, and we only know T must appear once (since it was marked as “-” in STRAW, implying it’s not doubled).

Another candidate: “TURBO” – but B and O are new, and we don’t know about them yet.

A safer choice is “TARPS” – but S is ruled out.

Let’s pick “TARDY”:
- T (position 1)
- A (position 2) – but A must be in position 4, so this is invalid.

We need A fixed in position 4. So the word must be _ _ R A _.

We need T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are taken by R and A).

Let’s try “PARTY”:
- P, Y are new.
- A is in position 2, but must be in 4 – invalid.

Correct structure: _ _ R A _ with T somewhere.

Let’s try “FRANK” – but N is ruled out.

Next: “GRASP” – S and P are new, but S is ruled out.

Next: “DRAMA” – A repeats, but A is already placed once.

Next: “TRAIL” – I, L are new. Let’s check:
- T in position 1 (new position for T).
- R in 3 (✓).
- A in 4 (✓).
- I and L are new letters not yet tested.
This fits all constraints.

So, guess: TRAIL.

Let's carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: C, N, E
   - Letters in word but wrong position: R (not position 2), A (not position 3)

2. STRAW → S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: S, W (added to C, N, E)
   - T is in word but wrong position (was in position 2)

   - A is in position 4 (✓)

3. TRAIL → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
   - T is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)

   - A is in word but wrong position (was in position 4, now must be elsewhere)
   - I and L are NOT in word (added to previous exclusions)

So the secret word must:
- Start with T (position 1 confirmed)
- Have R somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5 since 3 is now wrong for R)
- Have A somewhere (positions 2 or 5 since 3 and 4 are wrong for A)
- Use only letters not yet ruled out: allowed letters are all others except C, N, E, S, W, I, L

We need a 5-letter word of the form T _ _ _ _ that contains both R and A, with R not in position 3 and A not in position 4.

Possible positions for R: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 2
   Then A must be in position 5 (since 2 is taken by R)
   Word structure: T R _ _ A

Case 2: R in position 4
   Then A must be in position 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R (but A not in 4, so 2 or 5)

Case 3: R in position 5
   Then A must be in position 2
   Structure: T A _ _ R

Now, let's find common 5-letter words fitting these patterns using allowed letters (no C, N, E, S, W, I, L).

For Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (but V not tested, A repeats)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (O, N, A - but N is excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

For Case 3: T A _ _ R
   Possible: T A B E R (E excluded)
   T A M A R (M, A not tested)
   T A M I R (I excluded)
   T A M O R (O, M not tested)
   T A M U R (U, M not tested)
   T A M P R (P not tested)
   T A M B R (B not tested)

The most promising seems ""TAMAR"" (but A repeats which might be allowed) or ""TRAMA"" (but A repeats).

Looking for common words: ""TAMAR"" isn't common, but ""TRAMA"" isn't either. ""TAMAR"" is a name, but valid word.

Another candidate: ""TURBA"" - but B not tested, U not tested, A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid (R must not be in 3).

Wait, let's re-examine Case 2: R in 4, A in 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R
   For T A _ R _:
      T A B R _ (B, _)
      T A M R _ (M, _)
   For T _ A _ R:
      T O A R _ (O, _)
      T U A R _ (U, _)

Looking at common words: ""TOAR_"" doesn't seem valid. ""TUAR_"" doesn't seem valid.

Actually, ""TURBO"" comes to mind, but:
   T(1) U(?) R(?) B(?) O(?)
   R is in 3 which is invalid (from TRAIL feedback R was in 3 and marked wrong)
   So TURBO is invalid.

Next: ""TAROK"" - but K not tested, O not tested, positions:
   T(1) A(2) R(3) - but R cannot be in 3 (from TRAIL feedback)
   So invalid.

Next: ""TAPIR"" - but I is excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" - O and T repeat, but T is already in 1.

Next: ""TARPS"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TAROC"" - C excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" already considered.

Next: ""TAROK"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" - Q not tested, but A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURIA"" - I excluded.

Next: ""TURBO"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURRA"" - R repeats, but R could be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURSA"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURBO"" invalid.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Let me re-examine Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (V not tested)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (N excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

""TRAVA"" is a word (Italian for ""to work""), but might be obscure.

""TRAMA"" is a word (plural of trama in Spanish/Italian, meaning story).

""TRADA"" is a word (type of fishing net).

""TRUDA"" is a word (name).

Among these, ""TRAMA"" seems the most plausible common word.

But let's check if it fits:
   T(1) R(2) A(5)
   R is in position 2 (new position, allowed since R was not in 2 before)
   A is in position 5 (new position, allowed since A was not in 5 before)
   Letters used: T, R, A, M
   M is new and allowed.

Thus, ""TRAMA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TRAVA"" - V is new, but less common.

Thus, I'll go with TRAMA.Based on the updated constraints:
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- R must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- A must be in positions 2 or 5 (not 3 or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L.

The word ""TRAMA"" fits:
- T(1) R(2) A(5)
- R is in position 2 (new position).
- A is in position 5 (new position).
- Uses new letter M.

- R cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from CRANE and TRAMA).
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from CRANE and TRAMA).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M.

Possible positions:
- R can only be in positions 4 or 5.
- A can only be in position 2.

Thus the word must be: T A _ R _ or T A _ _ R.

Looking at remaining positions and allowed letters (no C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M), the only common letters left are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let's consider:

The only plausible word here seems to be TABUR (a type of fish or a name). However, it's obscure. 

Another possibility: T A B O R? (TABOR is a word, meaning a type of drum or the act of restraining).

TABOR fits:
- T(1) A(2) B(?) O(?) R(5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal useful information about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C and N are NOT in the word (x).
- R and A are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, N, or E.
- Contains R and A, but R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids C, N, and E.

Good new letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that incorporates R and A in new spots and adds fresh common letters is “STRAW”:
- S, T, L are new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.
- A moves from position 3 to 2.

This should give us new information while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on STRAW:
- S and W are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- A is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓).

So the secret word is now known to look like:
_ _ R A _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, E, S, W.

Letters we know ARE in the word: R (position 3), A (position 4), T (somewhere else).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 3.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Contains T somewhere (but not in position 2, since that’s where it was in STRAW).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for T: 1 or 5 (since 2 is wrong, 3 and 4 are already R and A).

Let’s try a word that places T in position 1: “TRADE”.
- T in position 1 (new position).
- R in position 3 (matches ✓).
- A in position 4 (matches ✓).
- D and E: E is already ruled out (from CRANE), so this won’t work.

Next option: “TAROK” – but K hasn’t been tested yet, and O hasn’t either, but we have no constraints on them. However, we should prefer common letters.

Better choice: “TAROT” – but O and T are repeated, and we only know T must appear once (since it was marked as “-” in STRAW, implying it’s not doubled).

Another candidate: “TURBO” – but B and O are new, and we don’t know about them yet.

A safer choice is “TARPS” – but S is ruled out.

Let’s pick “TARDY”:
- T (position 1)
- A (position 2) – but A must be in position 4, so this is invalid.

We need A fixed in position 4. So the word must be _ _ R A _.

We need T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 and 4 are taken by R and A).

Let’s try “PARTY”:
- P, Y are new.
- A is in position 2, but must be in 4 – invalid.

Correct structure: _ _ R A _ with T somewhere.

Let’s try “FRANK” – but N is ruled out.

Next: “GRASP” – S and P are new, but S is ruled out.

Next: “DRAMA” – A repeats, but A is already placed once.

Next: “TRAIL” – I, L are new. Let’s check:
- T in position 1 (new position for T).
- R in 3 (✓).
- A in 4 (✓).
- I and L are new letters not yet tested.
This fits all constraints.

So, guess: TRAIL.

Guess 3: TRAIL -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
Let's carefully update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: C, N, E
   - Letters in word but wrong position: R (not position 2), A (not position 3)

2. STRAW → S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)
   - Letters NOT in word: S, W (added to C, N, E)
   - T is in word but wrong position (was in position 2)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)
   - A is in position 4 (✓)

3. TRAIL → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
   - T is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
   - R is in word but wrong position (was in position 3, now must be elsewhere)
   - A is in word but wrong position (was in position 4, now must be elsewhere)
   - I and L are NOT in word (added to previous exclusions)

So the secret word must:
- Start with T (position 1 confirmed)
- Have R somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5 since 3 is now wrong for R)
- Have A somewhere (positions 2 or 5 since 3 and 4 are wrong for A)
- Use only letters not yet ruled out: allowed letters are all others except C, N, E, S, W, I, L

We need a 5-letter word of the form T _ _ _ _ that contains both R and A, with R not in position 3 and A not in position 4.

Possible positions for R: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 2
   Then A must be in position 5 (since 2 is taken by R)
   Word structure: T R _ _ A

Case 2: R in position 4
   Then A must be in position 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R (but A not in 4, so 2 or 5)

Case 3: R in position 5
   Then A must be in position 2
   Structure: T A _ _ R

Now, let's find common 5-letter words fitting these patterns using allowed letters (no C, N, E, S, W, I, L).

For Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (but V not tested, A repeats)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (O, N, A - but N is excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

For Case 3: T A _ _ R
   Possible: T A B E R (E excluded)
   T A M A R (M, A not tested)
   T A M I R (I excluded)
   T A M O R (O, M not tested)
   T A M U R (U, M not tested)
   T A M P R (P not tested)
   T A M B R (B not tested)

The most promising seems ""TAMAR"" (but A repeats which might be allowed) or ""TRAMA"" (but A repeats).

Looking for common words: ""TAMAR"" isn't common, but ""TRAMA"" isn't either. ""TAMAR"" is a name, but valid word.

Another candidate: ""TURBA"" - but B not tested, U not tested, A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid (R must not be in 3).

Wait, let's re-examine Case 2: R in 4, A in 2 or 5
   Structure: T A _ R _ or T _ A _ R
   For T A _ R _:
      T A B R _ (B, _)
      T A M R _ (M, _)
   For T _ A _ R:
      T O A R _ (O, _)
      T U A R _ (U, _)

Looking at common words: ""TOAR_"" doesn't seem valid. ""TUAR_"" doesn't seem valid.

Actually, ""TURBO"" comes to mind, but:
   T(1) U(?) R(?) B(?) O(?)
   R is in 3 which is invalid (from TRAIL feedback R was in 3 and marked wrong)
   So TURBO is invalid.

Next: ""TAROK"" - but K not tested, O not tested, positions:
   T(1) A(2) R(3) - but R cannot be in 3 (from TRAIL feedback)
   So invalid.

Next: ""TAPIR"" - but I is excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" - O and T repeat, but T is already in 1.

Next: ""TARPS"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TAROC"" - C excluded.

Next: ""TAROT"" already considered.

Next: ""TAROK"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" - Q not tested, but A at 5 fits T(1) R(?) A(5), but R would be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURIA"" - I excluded.

Next: ""TURBO"" already considered.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURRA"" - R repeats, but R could be in 3 which is invalid.

Next: ""TURSA"" - S excluded.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Next: ""TURBO"" invalid.

Next: ""TURQA"" invalid.

Let me re-examine Case 1: T R _ _ A
   Possible: TRAVA (V not tested)
   TRADA (D not tested)
   TRAGA (G not tested)
   TRAMA (M not tested)
   TRONA (N excluded)
   TRUDA (U, D not tested)

""TRAVA"" is a word (Italian for ""to work""), but might be obscure.

""TRAMA"" is a word (plural of trama in Spanish/Italian, meaning story).

""TRADA"" is a word (type of fishing net).

""TRUDA"" is a word (name).

Among these, ""TRAMA"" seems the most plausible common word.

But let's check if it fits:
   T(1) R(2) A(5)
   R is in position 2 (new position, allowed since R was not in 2 before)
   A is in position 5 (new position, allowed since A was not in 5 before)
   Letters used: T, R, A, M
   M is new and allowed.

Thus, ""TRAMA"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TRAVA"" - V is new, but less common.

Thus, I'll go with TRAMA.Based on the updated constraints:
- T is confirmed in position 1.
- R must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).
- A must be in positions 2 or 5 (not 3 or 4).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L.

The word ""TRAMA"" fits:
- T(1) R(2) A(5)
- R is in position 2 (new position).
- A is in position 5 (new position).
- Uses new letter M.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: STRAW -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)

Guess 4: TRAMA -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

TRAMA → T(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) A(-)

1. T is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
2. R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
3. A is in the word but not in position 3 (-) and not in position 5 (-).
4. M is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with T.
- Must contain R and A.
- R cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from CRANE and TRAMA).
- A cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from CRANE and TRAMA).
- Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M.

Possible positions:
- R can only be in positions 4 or 5.
- A can only be in position 2.

Thus the word must be: T A _ R _ or T A _ _ R.

Looking at remaining positions and allowed letters (no C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M), the only common letters left are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Let's consider:
- T A _ R _ : The blank could be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.
  Possible words: TABER? (not valid), TADAR? (invalid), TAFAR? (invalid), TAGAR? (invalid), TAHER? (invalid), TAKAR? (invalid), TALOR? (L excluded), TAMAR? (M excluded), TAPON? (N excluded), TAROK? (K not tested, but O is allowed), TARTAR? (invalid), TAROT? (O and T repeat, but T is already used), TARPS? (S excluded).

- T A _ _ R : The blanks could be any allowed letters.
  Possible words: T A B E R? (E excluded), T A B U R? (TABUR is a word), T A D U R? (invalid), T A F U R? (invalid), T A G U R? (invalid), T A H U R? (invalid), T A J U R? (invalid), T A K U R? (invalid), T A O U R? (invalid), T A P U R? (invalid), T A Q U R? (invalid), T A V U R? (invalid), T A Y U R? (invalid).

The only plausible word here seems to be TABUR (a type of fish or a name). However, it's obscure. 

Another possibility: T A B O R? (TABOR is a word, meaning a type of drum or the act of restraining).

TABOR fits:
- T(1) A(2) B(?) O(?) R(5)
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be in 2 or 3).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- B and O are new letters not yet tested.
- Excluded letters are respected.

Thus, TABOR seems the best next guess.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

1. T is locked in position 1 (✓).
2. The word must contain both R and A.
3. R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from TRAIL and TABOR feedback).
4. A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from CRANE, TRAMA, and TABOR feedback).
5. Excluded letters so far: C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M, B.
6. Remaining positions for R and A:
   - R can only be in position 4.
   - A can only be in position 5 (but feedback says A is not in 5 from TRAMA), so this is impossible.

Wait, this is a contradiction. Let me re-examine:

From TRAMA: A is not in position 5 (-).
From TABOR: A is not in position 2 (-).

So A cannot be in positions 2 or 5, and cannot be in 3 or 4 (from CRANE and TABOR).  
That leaves no possible position for A, which means our deduction must be wrong.

Rechecking:
- CRANE: A not in 3.
- TRAMA: A not in 5.
- TABOR: A not in 2.

Thus A can only be in position 4.

Similarly:
- R cannot be in positions 2 (TRAMA), 3 (TRAIL), or 5 (TABOR).
- R can only be in position 4.

But if both A and R must be in position 4, this is impossible. The only resolution is that we misread TABOR feedback.

Looking back: TABOR feedback is T(✓) A(-) B(x) O(-) R(-).

- A(-) means A is in word but not in position 2.
- O(-) means O is in word but not in position 4.
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 5.

So:
- R cannot be in 2, 3, or 5.
- A cannot be in 2 or 3 or 5.
- Thus:
   - A must be in position 4.
   - R must be in position 4 (only remaining spot), but this is impossible unless A and R are same letter, which they are not.

This indicates an error in earlier interpretation. Let me re-tabulate:

Corrected constraints:
- T is fixed in position 1.
- Word must contain R and A.
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from TRAIL and TABOR).
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from CRANE, TRAMA, and TABOR).
- Therefore A must be in position 4, and R must be in position 4, which is impossible.

This suggests we missed that O is in the word from TABOR (O(-) means O is in word but not in position 4).

So we now have:
- Letters to place: T (fixed at 1), R, A, O.
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- R cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 → R must be in 4.
- A cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 → A must be in 4, but 4 is taken by R. Contradiction.

The only way this works is if A is in position 5, but TRAMA says A is not in 5. This implies no valid placement, meaning our assumption that both R and A are required is correct, but we must have missed a placement.

Rechecking:
From CRANE: A not in 3.
From TRAW: A in 4 (✓).
From TRAIL: A not in 4 (-) → contradiction with TRAW.

Wait, this shows an inconsistency in feedback interpretation. Let me re-interpret all feedback carefully:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in word but not in position 2.
   - A is in word but not in position 3.

2. STRAW → S(x) T(-) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)
   - T is in word but not in position 2.
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - A is in position 4 (✓).

3. TRAIL → T(✓) R(-) A(-) I(x) L(x)
   - T is in position 1 (✓).
   - R is in word but not in position 2.
   - A is in word but not in position 3.
   - I and L are not in word.

4. TRAMA → T(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) A(-)
   - T is in position 1 (✓).
   - R is in word but not in position 2.
   - A is in word but not in position 3.
   - M is not in word.
   - Second A(-) means A is not in position 5.

5. TABOR → T(✓) A(-) B(x) O(-) R(-)
   - T is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in word but not in position 2.
   - B is not in word.
   - O is in word but not in position 4.
   - R is in word but not in position 5.

Now, with all constraints:
- T is fixed in position 1.
- A must be in position 4 (from STRAW feedback).
- R must be in position 3 (from STRAW feedback).
- O is in word but not in position 4 → must be in position 2 or 5.
- Position 3 is R, position 4 is A, so O must be in position 2 or 5.
- Position 1 is T, so remaining positions: 2 and 5 for O and whatever else.

Word structure: T _ R A _

O must be in position 2 or 5. Let's try position 2: T O R A _. Then position 5 must be a letter not yet used and not excluded. Excluded letters: C, N, E, S, W, I, L, M, B. Remaining possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, K, P, U.

Possible words: T O R A D, T O R A F, T O R A G, T O R A H, T O R A K, T O R A P, T O R A U.

""TORAD"" is not a word.
""TORAF"" is not a word.
""TORAG"" is not a word.
""TORAH"" is a word (Hebrew scripture).
""TORAK"" is not a word.
""TORAP"" is not a word.
""TORAU"" is not a word.

Next, try O in position 5: T _ R A O. Then position 2 must be a letter not excluded. Possible: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: D, F, G, H, K, P, U.

Possible words: T D R A O, T F R A O, T G R A O, T H R A O, T K R A O, T P R A O, T U R A O.

""THRAO"" is not a word.
""TRAO"" is not valid.

""TORAH"" seems the only plausible word fitting T O R A H, but this would place O in position 2, R in 3, A in 4, H in 5. This fits all constraints:
- T(1) O(2) R(3) A(4) H(5)
- T is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 4 (✓).
- R is in position 3 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not in 4, ✓).
- All excluded letters avoided.

Thus, the only remaining candidate is TORAH.
