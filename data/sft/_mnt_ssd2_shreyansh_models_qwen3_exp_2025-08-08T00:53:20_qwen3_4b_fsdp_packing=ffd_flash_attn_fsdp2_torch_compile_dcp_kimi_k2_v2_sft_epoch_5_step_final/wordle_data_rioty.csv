For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.
3. We still need to determine the other four letters.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible patterns: _ _ _ T _

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and doesn’t repeat any excluded ones. A good candidate is “PRINT”:
- P, R, I, N are all still possible.
- T is confirmed in the 4th position.
- No S, L, A, E are used.

This gives us new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after the two guesses.

1. From SLATE:  
   - T is in the 4th position (✓).  
   - S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:  
   - P and N are NOT in the word (x).  
   - R, I, T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
     – T is already known to be in position 4, so the two “T(-)” entries are consistent: T is in the word and already locked in position 4, so the other instances of T in PRINT (positions 1 and 5) are simply wrong.  
     – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
     – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far:
- Letters confirmed in the word: T (position 4), R, I.  
- Letters excluded: S, L, A, E, P, N.  
- Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Position 4 is T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains R and I somewhere (but R≠2 and I≠3).  
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (I already must appear somewhere).

Let’s build a candidate:
- Position 4 = T.  
- We must include R and I.  
- We can try placing I in position 1 or 2 or 5, and R in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
- To maximize commonality, try O or U in the remaining open slot.

A promising pattern: I _ R T _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed. Let’s try U: I R T U T – but that repeats T.  
Try C: I R T C _ – but we still need a 5th letter.  

A better pattern: _ I R T _  
We can try B: B I R T H – but H is allowed and not excluded.  
Check letters: B, I, R, T, H – none are excluded.  
Check constraints:
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in position 2).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in position 3).  
- B and H are new letters not yet tested.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. From SLATE:

   - S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:
   - P, N are NOT in the word (x).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - T is already locked in position 4, so the “T(-)” in PRINT simply reconfirms T is in the word and already correctly placed.

3. From BIRTH:
   - B, H are NOT in the word (x).
   - I is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since the feedback shows R(-) for position 3).
   - T is confirmed again in position 4 (✓).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ I _ T _
- Must contain R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5, but NOT 2 or 4).
- Cannot use any of: S, L, A, E, P, N, B, H.
- Remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O, U (since I is already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and T in position 4.
- Contains R exactly once (since no duplicates have been hinted).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- R I _ T _  (R in position 1)
- _ I R T _  (R in position 3)
- _ I _ T R  (R in position 5)

Let’s explore each:
1. R I _ T _: Need a valid 3rd letter (allowed) and a 5th letter (allowed).  
   Example: R I C T O – but O is allowed. Check if RICTO is a word? Not common.  
   R I D T Y – RIDTY? Not a word.  
   R I M T Y – RIMTY? No.  
   R I G T Y – RIGTY? No.  
   R I C T U – RICTU? No.  
   R I C T O – RICTO? Not valid.

2. _ I R T _: Need a 1st letter (allowed) and a 5th letter (allowed).  
   Example: C I R T Y – CIRTY? No.  
   D I R T Y – DIRTY! Valid word.

   - T in position 4 (✓).  
   - R in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in position 2).  
   - D and Y are new, allowed letters.  

This fits perfectly.

3. _ I _ T R: Need 1st and 3rd letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.
3. We still need to determine the other four letters.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible patterns: _ _ _ T _

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and doesn’t repeat any excluded ones. A good candidate is “PRINT”:
- P, R, I, N are all still possible.
- T is confirmed in the 4th position.
- No S, L, A, E are used.

This gives us new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after the two guesses.

1. From SLATE:  
   - T is in the 4th position (✓).  
   - S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:  
   - P and N are NOT in the word (x).  
   - R, I, T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
     – T is already known to be in position 4, so the two “T(-)” entries are consistent: T is in the word and already locked in position 4, so the other instances of T in PRINT (positions 1 and 5) are simply wrong.  
     – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
     – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far:
- Letters confirmed in the word: T (position 4), R, I.  
- Letters excluded: S, L, A, E, P, N.  
- Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Position 4 is T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains R and I somewhere (but R≠2 and I≠3).  
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (I already must appear somewhere).

Let’s build a candidate:
- Position 4 = T.  
- We must include R and I.  
- We can try placing I in position 1 or 2 or 5, and R in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
- To maximize commonality, try O or U in the remaining open slot.

A promising pattern: I _ R T _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed. Let’s try U: I R T U T – but that repeats T.  
Try C: I R T C _ – but we still need a 5th letter.  

A better pattern: _ I R T _  
We can try B: B I R T H – but H is allowed and not excluded.  
Check letters: B, I, R, T, H – none are excluded.  
Check constraints:
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in position 2).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in position 3).  
- B and H are new letters not yet tested.

Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. From all feedback so far:
   - Pattern: _ I _ T Y  (positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: I, T, Y).
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from PRINT and DIRTY feedback).
   - Therefore R must be in position 1.
   - The only remaining unknown letter is position 3, which must be a consonant not yet excluded.

2. Excluded letters accumulated:
   S, L, A, E, P, N, B, H, D, Y (Y is now confirmed in position 5), I (already placed), T (already placed).

3. Allowed letters for position 3:
   From the alphabet, remove all excluded letters and the ones already used (R, I, T, Y). Remaining consonants: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus vowels O, U.

4. We need a 5-letter word matching R I _ T Y that is valid.

   - R I C T Y → RICTY – not a valid English word.
   - R I F T Y → RIFTY – not valid.
   - R I G T Y → RIGTY – not valid.
   - R I K T Y → RIKTY – not valid.
   - R I M T Y → RIMTY – not valid.
   - R I O T Y → RIOTY – archaic, not common.
   - R I U T Y → RIUTY – not valid.
   - R I V T Y → RIVTY – not valid.
   - R I W T Y → RIWTY – not valid.
   - R I Z T Y → RIZTY – not valid.
   - R I J T Y → RIJTY – not valid.
   - R I Q T Y → RIQTY – not valid.
   - R I X T Y → RIXTY – not valid.

5. However, “riot” is a valid 4-letter word, but we need 5 letters ending in “ITY”. The only common 5-letter word ending in “ITY” with R I _ T Y is “RITTY”, but that’s a name and usually not accepted in word lists.

6. Re-examining the constraints:
   - We have R must be in position 1, I in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
   - Position 3 must be a consonant not yet excluded.
   - The word must be valid.

   The only valid English word fitting R I _ T Y is “RITTY” (though it’s a name), but if we consider “RITTY” as acceptable, it would be the answer. However, it’s safer to check if we missed any constraints.

7. Double-checking:
   - R is allowed in position 1 (no restriction violated).
   - Position 3: any consonant not excluded.
   - The word must be valid; “RITTY” is the only candidate.

Given the constraints, “RITTY” is the only possible word, though it’s a name. However, in Wordle-like games, proper nouns are sometimes accepted. If not, we might have to consider that no perfect word exists, but “RITTY” is the closest.

But let me think again: is there another valid word? “RIGGY” doesn’t fit the pattern. “RIPSY” – no. “RIFLY” – no. “RITZY” – R I T Z Y, but T is in position 4, so R I Z T Y – not valid.

Thus, the only possible word is “RITTY”.

However, looking back at the feedback, in DIRTY the R was marked (-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 3. Since R must be in position 1, the word is R I _ T Y. The only valid word is “RITTY”.

But “RITTY” is a valid variant spelling of “ratty” in some contexts, though rare. Given the constraints, this seems the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess must be “RITTY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct, high-frequency letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters and covers both vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- T is in the correct position (position 4).
- S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has T in the 4th position.
2. The letters S, L, A, E are excluded.
3. We still need to determine the other four letters.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Possible patterns: _ _ _ T _

Let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and doesn’t repeat any excluded ones. A good candidate is “PRINT”:
- P, R, I, N are all still possible.
- T is confirmed in the 4th position.
- No S, L, A, E are used.

This gives us new letters to test while respecting the constraints.

Let’s update what we now know after the two guesses.

1. From SLATE:  
   - T is in the 4th position (✓).  
   - S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:  
   - P and N are NOT in the word (x).  
   - R, I, T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).  
     – T is already known to be in position 4, so the two “T(-)” entries are consistent: T is in the word and already locked in position 4, so the other instances of T in PRINT (positions 1 and 5) are simply wrong.  
     – R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
     – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far:
- Letters confirmed in the word: T (position 4), R, I.  
- Letters excluded: S, L, A, E, P, N.  
- Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 3, 5.  
- Position 4 is T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has T in position 4.  
- Contains R and I somewhere (but R≠2 and I≠3).  
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (I already must appear somewhere).

Let’s build a candidate:
- Position 4 = T.  
- We must include R and I.  
- We can try placing I in position 1 or 2 or 5, and R in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2).  
- To maximize commonality, try O or U in the remaining open slot.

A promising pattern: I _ R T _  
We need a 5th letter that is allowed. Let’s try U: I R T U T – but that repeats T.  
Try C: I R T C _ – but we still need a 5th letter.  

A better pattern: _ I R T _  
We can try B: B I R T H – but H is allowed and not excluded.  
Check letters: B, I, R, T, H – none are excluded.  
Check constraints:
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in position 2).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in position 3).  
- B and H are new letters not yet tested.  

This seems valid.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. From SLATE:
   - T is in position 4 (✓).
   - S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).

2. From PRINT:
   - P, N are NOT in the word (x).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - T is already locked in position 4, so the “T(-)” in PRINT simply reconfirms T is in the word and already correctly placed.

3. From BIRTH:
   - B, H are NOT in the word (x).
   - I is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (since the feedback shows R(-) for position 3).
   - T is confirmed again in position 4 (✓).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ I _ T _
- Must contain R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5, but NOT 2 or 4).
- Cannot use any of: S, L, A, E, P, N, B, H.
- Remaining allowed letters: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus vowels O, U (since I is already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and T in position 4.
- Contains R exactly once (since no duplicates have been hinted).
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- R I _ T _  (R in position 1)
- _ I R T _  (R in position 3)
- _ I _ T R  (R in position 5)

Let’s explore each:
1. R I _ T _: Need a valid 3rd letter (allowed) and a 5th letter (allowed).  
   Example: R I C T O – but O is allowed. Check if RICTO is a word? Not common.  
   R I D T Y – RIDTY? Not a word.  
   R I M T Y – RIMTY? No.  
   R I G T Y – RIGTY? No.  
   R I C T U – RICTU? No.  
   R I C T O – RICTO? Not valid.

2. _ I R T _: Need a 1st letter (allowed) and a 5th letter (allowed).  
   Example: C I R T Y – CIRTY? No.  
   D I R T Y – DIRTY! Valid word.  
   Check letters: D, I, R, T, Y – none are excluded.  
   Check constraints:  
   - I in position 2 (✓).  
   - T in position 4 (✓).  
   - R in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in position 2).  
   - D and Y are new, allowed letters.  

This fits perfectly.

3. _ I _ T R: Need 1st and 3rd letters.  
   Example: C I D T R – CIDTR? No.  
   D I O T R – DIOTR? No.  
   Not common words.

Thus, DIRTY is the most plausible next guess.

Let’s update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

1. From all feedback so far:
   - Pattern: _ I _ T Y  (positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: I, T, Y).
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from PRINT and DIRTY feedback).
   - Therefore R must be in position 1.
   - The only remaining unknown letter is position 3, which must be a consonant not yet excluded.

2. Excluded letters accumulated:
   S, L, A, E, P, N, B, H, D, Y (Y is now confirmed in position 5), I (already placed), T (already placed).

3. Allowed letters for position 3:
   From the alphabet, remove all excluded letters and the ones already used (R, I, T, Y). Remaining consonants: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus vowels O, U.

4. We need a 5-letter word matching R I _ T Y that is valid.

   - R I C T Y → RICTY – not a valid English word.
   - R I F T Y → RIFTY – not valid.
   - R I G T Y → RIGTY – not valid.
   - R I K T Y → RIKTY – not valid.
   - R I M T Y → RIMTY – not valid.
   - R I O T Y → RIOTY – archaic, not common.
   - R I U T Y → RIUTY – not valid.
   - R I V T Y → RIVTY – not valid.
   - R I W T Y → RIWTY – not valid.
   - R I Z T Y → RIZTY – not valid.
   - R I J T Y → RIJTY – not valid.
   - R I Q T Y → RIQTY – not valid.
   - R I X T Y → RIXTY – not valid.

5. However, “riot” is a valid 4-letter word, but we need 5 letters ending in “ITY”. The only common 5-letter word ending in “ITY” with R I _ T Y is “RITTY”, but that’s a name and usually not accepted in word lists.

6. Re-examining the constraints:
   - We have R must be in position 1, I in 2, T in 4, Y in 5.
   - Position 3 must be a consonant not yet excluded.
   - The word must be valid.

   The only valid English word fitting R I _ T Y is “RITTY” (though it’s a name), but if we consider “RITTY” as acceptable, it would be the answer. However, it’s safer to check if we missed any constraints.

7. Double-checking:
   - R is allowed in position 1 (no restriction violated).
   - Position 3: any consonant not excluded.
   - The word must be valid; “RITTY” is the only candidate.

Given the constraints, “RITTY” is the only possible word, though it’s a name. However, in Wordle-like games, proper nouns are sometimes accepted. If not, we might have to consider that no perfect word exists, but “RITTY” is the closest.

But let me think again: is there another valid word? “RIGGY” doesn’t fit the pattern. “RIPSY” – no. “RIFLY” – no. “RITZY” – R I T Z Y, but T is in position 4, so R I Z T Y – not valid.

Thus, the only possible word is “RITTY”.

However, looking back at the feedback, in DIRTY the R was marked (-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 3. Since R must be in position 1, the word is R I _ T Y. The only valid word is “RITTY”.

But “RITTY” is a valid variant spelling of “ratty” in some contexts, though rare. Given the constraints, this seems the only possibility.

Therefore, the next guess must be “RITTY”.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after the fifth guess.

1. From every feedback so far:
   - Position 2 = I (✓)  
   - Position 4 = T (✓)  
   - Position 5 = Y (✓)  
   - Position 1 = R (✓)  
   - Position 3:  
        – The feedback for RITTY shows T(-) in position 3, which means the letter T is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
        – We already have T locked in position 4, so this simply reconfirms T is in position 4 and not elsewhere.  
   - Therefore the pattern is exactly: R I _ T Y.

2. The only remaining unknown is the third letter.  
   - Allowed letters: every letter not yet excluded and not already used (R, I, T, Y).  
   - Excluded letters so far: S, L, A, E, P, N, B, H, D.  
   - Remaining consonants: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   - Remaining vowels: O, U (but position 3 is more likely a consonant).

3. We need a 5-letter English word matching R I _ T Y.  
   The only common English word that fits is R I C T Y → RICTY is not valid.  
   R I F T Y → RIFTY is not valid.  
   R I G T Y → RIGTY is not valid.  
   R I K T Y → RIKTY is not valid.  
   R I M T Y → RIMTY is not valid.  
   R I O T Y → RIOTY is archaic.  
   R I U T Y → RIUTY is not valid.  
   R I V T Y → RIVTY is not valid.  
   R I W T Y → RIWTY is not valid.  
   R I Z T Y → RIZTY is not valid.  
   R I J T Y → RIJTY is not valid.  
   R I Q T Y → RIQTY is not valid.  
   R I X T Y → RIXTY is not valid.

4. However, “RITZY” is a valid variant spelling (slang/old-timey) for “ratty,” but it’s 5 letters and fits R I T Z Y, yet T is already in position 4.  
   The only exact match is R I C T Y, but that’s not a word.

5. Re-examining: the only valid English word that is 5 letters and matches R I _ T Y is “RITTY,” which we already guessed. Since we must guess again, and no other common word fits, we must accept that “RITTY” is the intended answer despite being a name, as it’s the only candidate.

Therefore, the sixth and final guess must be RITTY again, but since we already used it, we must have missed something. However, in Wordle rules, the word list is fixed, and “RITTY” is accepted in some dictionaries. Thus, we proceed.

But wait—let me verify once more: is there a valid word R I _ T Y? Yes: “RITZY” (as noted) is accepted in some lists, but it’s non-standard. The most likely intended word is “RITTY.”

Given the constraints, the only possible word is:

R I C T Y → not valid  
R I F T Y → not valid  
…  
R I T Z Y → RITZY (valid in some dictionaries)

Given the feedback, “RITZY” is the closest valid word fitting R I _ T Y. However, since we already guessed RITTY and it was marked with R(✓) I(✓) T(-) T(✓) Y(✓), the T(-) in position 3 is irrelevant because T is already fixed in position 4. Thus, the word must be R I _ T Y with any consonant in position 3. The only valid word is R I C T Y, but that’s not a word. Rechecking, the actual valid word is “RITZY.”

Hence, the correct word must be RITZY.

But to be absolutely certain, let me list all valid 5-letter English words ending in R I _ T Y:

- RITTY (name) – accepted in some word lists  
- RITZY (slang) – accepted in some dictionaries  

Between these, “RITTY” is more common in word games, so we’ll go with it.

However, since we already guessed RITTY and it was marked ✓ for positions 1-2-4-5, the only remaining unknown is position 3, and the word must be RITTY. This implies the puzzle expects RITTY as the answer.

Therefore, the sixth guess must be RITTY, but since we already used it, we must have made an error. Re-evaluating, the correct word is actually “RITZY.”

After careful re-examination, the only valid word fitting R I _ T Y is “RITZY.”
