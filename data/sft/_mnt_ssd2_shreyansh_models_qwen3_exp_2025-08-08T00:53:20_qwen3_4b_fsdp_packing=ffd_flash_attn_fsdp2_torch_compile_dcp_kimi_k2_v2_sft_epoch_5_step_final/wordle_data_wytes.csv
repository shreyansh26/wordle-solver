### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down the possibilities for future guesses.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)

Letters we now know:
- NOT in the word: A, R, O, I, N
- ARE in the word (but wrong positions): S, E, T

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STEIN) or 4 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 3 (from STEIN) or 5 (from AROSE)
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S, E, T
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, I, N
- Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Places E in positions 1, 2, or 4
- Places T in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I are out; E is already required)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Must have S, E, T
- Can use U as the only remaining vowel
- Good candidates: ""UTEST"" (but U is at 1, T at 2 - but T can't be at 2), ""TESTS"" (but S at 5 is allowed), ""STEAK"" (but A and K are out), ""STUMP"" (but P is allowed), ""STUPE"" (but P is allowed).

""STUMP"":

Letters known NOT to be in the word:

So far the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S, with E and T still to place.

Positions ruled out:

Possible positions left:
E can be in 1, 2, or 4
T can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already S), so 1 or 3 or 4

We need to place both E and T in the first four positions, without repeating any letters (since all letters in TESTS except S were marked wrong or wrong position).

Remaining letters we can use (excluding A,R,O,I,N and using S,E,T):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

But we already have E, so we might need another consonant or U.

Let’s try to construct:

We have _ _ _ _ S and need to place E and T in positions 1,2,3,4.

- T E _ _ S (T at 1 is allowed, E at 2 is allowed)

- T _ _ E S (E at 4 is allowed)

So valid patterns:

2. E _ _ T S
3. T E _ _ S
4. T _ _ E S

Let’s pick one and fill with remaining letters. For example, pattern 3: T E _ _ S

We need two more letters, not A,R,O,I,N and not T or E. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try common ones: T E D U S → ""TEDUS"" (but is this a word?)
Actually, ""TEDUS"" isn't valid.

Better: T E X T S → but T is already used.

T E M P S → ""TEmps"" not valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).

We need a 5-letter word that:

From the four guesses we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from TESTS and TUXES)
- E is in position 4 (✓ from TUXES)

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- T (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 5 based on previous feedback)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, I, N, U, X

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E S with T still to place and no other letters known.

Positions T can occupy:
- Cannot be in 1 (TUXES feedback), 2 (STEIN feedback), 5 (S is there)
- So T must be in position 3

Thus the word must be: _ _ T E S

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,R,O,I,N,U,X and T,E,S).

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: none left (only U was available and it's excluded)

We need to form a valid 5-letter word ending in _ T E S.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be _ _ T E S with T in position 3, E in 4, S in 5. The first two letters must be from the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

- F T E S → no
- G T E S → no
- H T E S → no
- K T E S → no
- L T E S → no
- M T E S → no
- P T E S → no
- Q T E S → no
- V T E S → no
- W T E S → no
- Y T E S → no
- Z T E S → no

None of these are valid. This suggests I might have made an error in deducing T must be in position 3.

Re-examining T's possible positions:
- From STEIN: T cannot be in position 2
- From TESTS: T cannot be in position 1
- From TUXES: T cannot be in position 1 (again)
So T can be in positions 3 or 4

But position 4 is E, so T must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be _ _ T E S, but none of these seem to form valid words with remaining letters.

This implies I might have missed a possible letter or word. Let me double-check remaining letters and possible words.

Looking back, the letters not excluded are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, plus E and S are already placed.

Possible valid words ending in _ T E S with these letters:
- L V T E S → ""LVTES"" no
- C L T E S → ""CLTES"" no
- M E T E S → but E is already in 4
- H E T E S → same issue
- Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""METES"" but E is already in position 4.

Wait, ""METES"" is a valid word meaning ""a line or strip marked off or measured"". Let me check if it fits all constraints:
- M: not excluded
- E: must be in position 4 (matches)
- T: in position 3 (allowed)
- E: already in 4
- S: in 5 (matches)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, helping narrow down the possibilities for future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, S is at position 4, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, E is at position 5, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Letters to exclude: A, R, O.
Letters we know are in the word: S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Places S somewhere other than position 4.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5.
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try to place S in position 1 and E in position 2, then fill the remaining spots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding A, R, O). Good remaining consonants: T, L, N, D, C, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

A word like ""SE"" plus three more letters: ""SETIC"" comes to mind, but that’s 5 letters and uses T, I, C. Let’s check:
- S at 1: allowed (not position 4).
- E at 2: allowed (not position 5).
- T, I, C: not excluded.
- No A, R, O.

""SETIC"" seems valid. Alternatively, ""SEWIT"" or ""SELFT"" could work, but ""SETIC"" is a good candidate.

Another option is ""STEIN"":
- S at 1: allowed.
- T, E, I, N: none are excluded.
- E at 3: allowed.
- Doesn’t contain A, R, O.

""STEIN"" is a common word and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with ""STEIN"".

- Good candidates: ""UTEST"" (but U is at 1, T at 2 - but T can't be at 2), ""TESTS"" (but S at 5 is allowed), ""STEAK"" (but A and K are out), ""STUMP"" (but P is allowed), ""STUPE"" (but P is allowed).

""STUMP"":
- S at 1: but S can't be at 1 (from STEIN feedback)
- So invalid.

""TESTS"":
- T at 1: allowed
- E at 2: allowed
- S at 3: allowed
- T at 4: allowed
- S at 5: allowed
- Contains T, E, S
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, I, N)
- All positions are allowed for S, E, T

""TESTS"" fits all constraints.

Alternative: ""STEWS"" (but W is allowed, but S at 5 is allowed, but E at 2 is allowed, T at 1 is allowed). However, ""TESTS"" is more straightforward.

Let’s go with ""TESTS"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: TESTS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN → S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: TESTS → T(-) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(✓)

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (now confirmed in position 5)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not positions 3 or 5)
- T (must appear somewhere, but not position 2)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, I, N

So far the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S, with E and T still to place.

Positions ruled out:
- E cannot be in 3 or 5
- T cannot be in 2

Possible positions left:
E can be in 1, 2, or 4
T can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already S), so 1 or 3 or 4

We need to place both E and T in the first four positions, without repeating any letters (since all letters in TESTS except S were marked wrong or wrong position).

Remaining letters we can use (excluding A,R,O,I,N and using S,E,T):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: U (only remaining vowel)

But we already have E, so we might need another consonant or U.

Let’s try to construct:

We have _ _ _ _ S and need to place E and T in positions 1,2,3,4.

Possible patterns:
- E T _ _ S (but then we need two more letters, and T is at 2 which is invalid)
- E _ T _ S (T at 3 is allowed)
- E _ _ T S (T at 4 is allowed)
- T E _ _ S (T at 1 is allowed, E at 2 is allowed)
- T _ E _ S (E at 3 is invalid)
- T _ _ E S (E at 4 is allowed)

So valid patterns:
1. E _ T _ S
2. E _ _ T S
3. T E _ _ S
4. T _ _ E S

Let’s pick one and fill with remaining letters. For example, pattern 3: T E _ _ S

We need two more letters, not A,R,O,I,N and not T or E. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try common ones: T E D U S → ""TEDUS"" (but is this a word?)
Actually, ""TEDUS"" isn't valid.

Better: T E X T S → but T is already used.

T E M P S → ""TEmps"" not valid.

T E S T S → but S is already at 5.

Wait, we need to use other letters. Let’s try pattern 1: E _ T _ S

E X T U S → ""EXTUS"" not valid.

E B T U S → not valid.

E L T U S → ""ELTUS"" not valid.

Pattern 2: E _ _ T S

E L V T S → ""ELVTS"" no.

E L U T S → ""ELUTS"" no.

Pattern 4: T _ _ E S

T U X E S → ""TUXES"" (valid word!)

Check constraints:
- T at 1: allowed
- U: not excluded
- X: not excluded
- E at 4: allowed
- S at 5: confirmed correct

This fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: TESTS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(✓)
Guess 4: TUXES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the four guesses we now know:

Letters that are definitely in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from TESTS and TUXES)
- E is in position 4 (✓ from TUXES)

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- T (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 5 based on previous feedback)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, R, O, I, N, U, X

So the word looks like: _ _ _ E S with T still to place and no other letters known.

Positions T can occupy:
- Cannot be in 1 (TUXES feedback), 2 (STEIN feedback), 5 (S is there)
- So T must be in position 3

Thus the word must be: _ _ T E S

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding A,R,O,I,N,U,X and T,E,S).

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: none left (only U was available and it's excluded)

We need to form a valid 5-letter word ending in _ T E S.

Possible endings: _ T E S
We need a valid 5-letter word with T in position 3, E in 4, S in 5.

Common words ending in TES:
- LITES (but I is excluded)
- WITES (I excluded)
- HUMES (U excluded)
- FUMES (U excluded)
- CUBES (U excluded)
- GUMES (U excluded)
- METES (M and E are allowed, but E is already in 4)
- BOTES (O excluded)
- DOTES (O excluded)
- HOTES (O excluded)
- JOTES (O excluded)
- LOTES (O excluded)
- MOTES (O excluded)
- POTES (O excluded)
- ROTES (R and O excluded)
- SOTES (S already used)
- ZOTES (O excluded)

Looking at the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z

Possible first two letters:
- M and E: METES (but E is already in position 4)
- H and E: HE_TES (HE is not a valid start)
- L and E: LE_TES (LE not valid)
- F and E: FE_TES (FE not valid)
- C and E: CE_TES (CE not valid)
- B and E: BE_TES (BE not valid)
- G and E: GE_TES (GE not valid)
- D and E: DE_TES (DE not valid)
- K and E: KE_TES (KE not valid)
- P and E: PE_TES (PE not valid)
- V and E: VE_TES (VE not valid)
- W and E: WE_TES (WE not valid)
- Y and E: YE_TES (YE not valid)
- Z and E: ZE_TES (ZE not valid)

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe we need to use consonants for both positions 1 and 2.

Possible combinations:
- B and L: BL_TES → BLTES (invalid)
- B and R: BR_TES (R excluded)
- C and L: CL_TES (CLTES invalid)
- D and L: DL_TES (DLTES invalid)
- F and L: FL_TES (FLTES invalid)
- G and L: GL_TES (GLTES invalid)
- H and L: HL_TES (HLTES invalid)
- K and L: KL_TES (KLTES invalid)
- L and D: LD_TES (LDTES invalid)
- M and D: MD_TES (MDTES invalid)
- P and D: PD_TES (PDtes invalid)
- V and D: VD_TES (VDtes invalid)
- W and D: WD_TES (WDtes invalid)
- Y and D: YD_TES (YDtes invalid)
- Z and D: ZD_TES (ZDtes invalid)

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be _ _ T E S with T in position 3, E in 4, S in 5. The first two letters must be from the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words with T in position 3, E in 4, S in 5:

- B T E S → no
- C T E S → no
- D T E S → no
- F T E S → no
- G T E S → no
- H T E S → no
- K T E S → no
- L T E S → no
- M T E S → no
- P T E S → no
- Q T E S → no
- V T E S → no
- W T E S → no
- Y T E S → no
- Z T E S → no

None of these are valid. This suggests I might have made an error in deducing T must be in position 3.

Re-examining T's possible positions:
- From STEIN: T cannot be in position 2
- From TESTS: T cannot be in position 1
- From TUXES: T cannot be in position 1 (again)
So T can be in positions 3 or 4

But position 4 is E, so T must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be _ _ T E S, but none of these seem to form valid words with remaining letters.

This implies I might have missed a possible letter or word. Let me double-check remaining letters and possible words.

Looking back, the letters not excluded are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, plus E and S are already placed.

Possible valid words ending in _ T E S with these letters:
- L V T E S → ""LVTES"" no
- C L T E S → ""CLTES"" no
- M E T E S → but E is already in 4
- H E T E S → same issue
- Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""METES"" but E is already in position 4.

Wait, ""METES"" is a valid word meaning ""a line or strip marked off or measured"". Let me check if it fits all constraints:
- M: not excluded
- E: must be in position 4 (matches)
- T: in position 3 (allowed)
- E: already in 4
- S: in 5 (matches)
- No excluded letters (A,R,O,I,N,U,X)

""METES"" fits perfectly.

Let me check if it fits all constraints:\n- M: not excluded\n- E: must be in position 4 (matches)\n- T: in position 3 (allowed)\n- E: already in 4\n- S: in 5 (matches)\n- No excluded letters (A,R,O,I,N,U,X)\n\n""METES"" fits perfectly.\n\n<guess>METES</guess>\n\n<guess>METES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) I(x) N(x)\nGuess 3: TESTS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(✓)\nGuess 4: TUXES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(x) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 5: METES -> FEEDBACK: M(x) E(-) T(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since METES shows E at position 2 as wrong).
- T(✓) → T is in the word AND in position 3.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is in the word AND in position 5.

So the word structure is now: _ _ T E S.

Letters already confirmed:
- T at 3
- E at 4
- S at 5

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, I, N, U, X, M

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2 from the remaining alphabet:
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels left: none (only E is allowed and it's already placed).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ** _ _ T E S **.

Looking at common English words:
- B T E S → no
- C T E S → no
- D T E S → no
- F T E S → no
- G T E S → no
- H T E S → no
- K T E S → no
- L T E S → no
- P T E S → no
- Q T E S → no
- V T E S → no
- W T E S → no
- Y T E S → no
- Z T E S → no

This suggests I might have missed a word. However, ""HETES"" is a valid word (though rare), but H and E are allowed:
- H: not excluded
- E: allowed in position 1 (only position 2 was excluded for E in METES)

But ""HETES"" is valid and fits:
- H: allowed
- E: allowed in position 1
- T: in position 3 (✓)
- E: in position 4 (✓)
- S: in position 5 (✓)

No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, ""HETES"" is the correct word.
