For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that cover different positions. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is also very common and covers vowels well.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S plus some of the remaining common letters. ""STUMP"" would be ideal, but it has an O-like vowel (U) and common consonants. However, ""STUMP"" has U and P, but P is less common. A better choice might be ""SLING"" (S, L, I, N, G), but G is less common. 

Another strong option is ""STINK"" (S, T, I, N, K). This uses S in position 1 (not 4), avoids A/R/O/E, and includes common letters T, I, N, K. 

I'll go with STINK.

We need a word that contains **S, I, N** and possibly **U**.  
Let’s try **USING**:

- S is in position 2 (allowed)  
- I is in position 3 – **forbidden** (feedback said I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3)  
So **USING** is invalid.

Next try **SINUS** – but N is in position 4, which is forbidden (from STINK feedback: N is in wrong position, so N cannot be in position 4).

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is also very common and covers vowels well.

Let’s try a word that uses S plus some of the remaining common letters. ""STUMP"" would be ideal, but it has an O-like vowel (U) and common consonants. However, ""STUMP"" has U and P, but P is less common. A better choice might be ""SLING"" (S, L, I, N, G), but G is less common. 

Another strong option is ""STINK"" (S, T, I, N, K). This uses S in position 1 (not 4), avoids A/R/O/E, and includes common letters T, I, N, K. 

I'll go with STINK.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, E  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: T, K (added to A, R, O, E)  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
   – Letters **I** and **N** are in the word but in the **wrong positions**.

So far we know:
- Must contain: S, I, N  
- Must **not** contain: A, R, O, E, T, K  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- I is **not** in position 3.  
- N is **not** in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are out and I is already in)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N  
- Avoids A, R, O, E, T, K  
- Avoids S in positions 1 or 4, I in position 3, N in position 4  
- Possibly includes U as the only remaining vowel

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- **UNISS** – invalid (double S and N not used)  
- **SNIPS** – invalid (P and S in wrong positions)  
- **SINUS** – invalid (U and S in wrong positions)  
- **LUNGS** – uses L, U, N, G, S – but lacks I  
- **FUSIL** – uses F, U, S, I, L – but N is missing  
- **SUNNY** – uses S, U, N, N, Y – but I is missing  

We need a word that contains **S, I, N** and possibly **U**.  
Let’s try **USING**:
- Letters: U, S, I, N, G – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 2 (allowed)  
- I is in position 3 – **forbidden** (feedback said I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3)  
So **USING** is invalid.

Next try **SINUS** – but N is in position 4, which is forbidden (from STINK feedback: N is in wrong position, so N cannot be in position 4).

Next try **LUNGS** – but lacks I.

Next try **FUSIL** – lacks N.

Next try **NIXIS** – invalid (X not common, double I).

Next try **MUSIN** – uses M, U, S, I, N – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 3 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters  
- All letters are from allowed set  

**MUSIN** seems valid.

But let me check if **MUSIN** is a recognized word – yes, it is a valid 5-letter English word (archaic for ""musical instrument"" or ""musical sound"").

So I'll go with **MUSIN**.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters not in the word: T, K (added to A, R, O, E)  
   – I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. MUSIN → M(x) U(x) S(-) I(-) N(-)

   – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   – N is in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Must contain: S, I, N  
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, E, T, K, M, U  
- S cannot be in positions 3 or 4  
- I cannot be in positions 3 or 4  
- N cannot be in positions 4 or 5  

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, I, N and only the allowed letters, with the positional restrictions.

Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3  

Let’s try to place S, I, N in allowed positions and fill the remaining slots with allowed consonants.

Example valid placements:
- S _ _ _ I N → but this would need 7 letters.  
- S I _ N _ → but N cannot be in 5.  
- S _ I _ N → N in 5 is forbidden.  
- _ S I _ N → N in 5 forbidden.  
- N _ S _ I → I in 5 allowed, N in 1 allowed, S in 3 forbidden.  
- N S _ I _ → I in 4 forbidden.  
- _ N S I _ → I in 4 forbidden.  
- _ _ S I N → N in 5 forbidden.  
- S _ N I _ → I in 4 forbidden.  
- S N _ I _ → I in 4 forbidden.  
- N _ I S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- N I S _ _ → S in 3 forbidden.  
- I _ N S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- I N _ S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- _ I N S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- _ N I S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- _ S N I _ → I in 4 forbidden.  
- _ _ N S I → S in 4 forbidden.  
- _ _ S N I → S in 3 forbidden.

- S _ I N _ → N in 5 forbidden.  
- S I _ N _ → N in 5 forbidden.  
- I _ S N _ → N in 5 forbidden.  
- I S _ N _ → N in 5 forbidden.  
- I _ N S _ → S in 4 forbidden.  
- I N _ S _ → S in 4 forbidden.

- _ _ _ S N → S in 4 forbidden.  
- _ _ _ N S → N in 4 forbidden.  
- _ _ _ I S → I in 4 forbidden.  

Looking at the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, Y, W, etc.

Let’s try to find a valid word:
- S must be in 1, 2, or 5  
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5  
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3  

Let’s try:
- S in 1, I in 2, N in 3 → S I N _ _ → need two more letters. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, Y, W  
Possible words: SINBG, SINCG, etc. – none are valid.  
- S in 1, N in 2, I in 5 → S N _ _ I → need two letters.  
Possible: SN_BI, SN_CI, etc. – SNOWI (invalid), SNOWY (has O), SNUGI (invalid).  
- N in 1, S in 2, I in 5 → N S _ _ I → NS_YI (invalid).  
- N in 1, I in 2, S in 5 → N I _ _ S → NI_Y_S (invalid).  
- S in 2, I in 1, N in 3 → I S N _ _ → ISN_B (invalid).  
- S in 2, N in 1, I in 5 → N S _ _ I → NS_YI (invalid).  
- S in 5, I in 1, N in 2 → I N _ _ S → IN_Y_S (invalid).  
- S in 5, N in 1, I in 2 → N I _ _ S → NI_Y_S (invalid).  
- S in 5, N in 3, I in 1 → I _ N _ S → I_BN_DS (invalid).  
- S in 5, N in 2, I in 1 → N I _ _ S → NI_Y_S (invalid).  
- S in 2, I in 5, N in 3 → _ S _ N I → _S_NI → possible: BSNRI (invalid).  
- S in 2, N in 3, I in 5 → _ S N _ I → _S_NI → possible: BSNRI (invalid).  
- S in 2, N in 1, I in 5 → N S _ _ I → NS_YI (invalid).  

Looking at valid English words, the only possible word that fits is **SNIPS**, but:
- S in 1 (allowed)  
- N in 2 (allowed)  
- I in 3 (forbidden) – so invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that cover different positions. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is also very common and covers vowels well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S plus some of the remaining common letters. ""STUMP"" would be ideal, but it has an O-like vowel (U) and common consonants. However, ""STUMP"" has U and P, but P is less common. A better choice might be ""SLING"" (S, L, I, N, G), but G is less common. 

Another strong option is ""STINK"" (S, T, I, N, K). This uses S in position 1 (not 4), avoids A/R/O/E, and includes common letters T, I, N, K. 

I'll go with STINK.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, E  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: T, K (added to A, R, O, E)  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
   – Letters **I** and **N** are in the word but in the **wrong positions**.

So far we know:
- Must contain: S, I, N  
- Must **not** contain: A, R, O, E, T, K  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- I is **not** in position 3.  
- N is **not** in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are out and I is already in)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N  
- Avoids A, R, O, E, T, K  
- Avoids S in positions 1 or 4, I in position 3, N in position 4  
- Possibly includes U as the only remaining vowel

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- **UNISS** – invalid (double S and N not used)  
- **SNIPS** – invalid (P and S in wrong positions)  
- **SINUS** – invalid (U and S in wrong positions)  
- **LUNGS** – uses L, U, N, G, S – but lacks I  
- **FUSIL** – uses F, U, S, I, L – but N is missing  
- **SUNNY** – uses S, U, N, N, Y – but I is missing  

We need a word that contains **S, I, N** and possibly **U**.  
Let’s try **USING**:
- Letters: U, S, I, N, G – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 2 (allowed)  
- I is in position 3 – **forbidden** (feedback said I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3)  
So **USING** is invalid.

Next try **SINUS** – but N is in position 4, which is forbidden (from STINK feedback: N is in wrong position, so N cannot be in position 4).

Next try **LUNGS** – but lacks I.

Next try **FUSIL** – lacks N.

Next try **NIXIS** – invalid (X not common, double I).

Next try **MUSIN** – uses M, U, S, I, N – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 3 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters  
- All letters are from allowed set  

**MUSIN** seems valid.

But let me check if **MUSIN** is a recognized word – yes, it is a valid 5-letter English word (archaic for ""musical instrument"" or ""musical sound"").

So I'll go with **MUSIN**.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:
A, R, O, E, T, K, M, U

Letters known TO be in the word (but positions unknown):
S, I, N

Forbidden positional information:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5

Remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden letters):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, I, N exactly once each
2. Uses only the remaining letters for the other two slots
3. Respects the positional bans above

Let’s list valid positions for each required letter:
- S: allowed positions 2, 5
- I: allowed positions 1, 2, 5
- N: allowed positions 1, 2, 3

We need to combine these sets while avoiding overlaps.

Possible placements:
- If N is in 1: then S can be 2 or 5, I can be 2 or 5 (but must avoid 3,4)
  - N S I _ _  → need two more letters
  - N I S _ _  → need two more letters
  - N _ S I _  → but I cannot be 4
  - N _ I S _  → but S cannot be 4
- If N is in 2: then S can be 2 (conflict) or 5, I can be 1,5
  - _ N S I _  → I at 4 is forbidden
  - _ N I S _  → valid
- If N is in 3: then S can be 2 or 5, I can be 1,2,5

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that cover different positions. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many words. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes O which is also very common and covers vowels well.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S somewhere other than the 4th position.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses S plus some of the remaining common letters. ""STUMP"" would be ideal, but it has an O-like vowel (U) and common consonants. However, ""STUMP"" has U and P, but P is less common. A better choice might be ""SLING"" (S, L, I, N, G), but G is less common. 

Another strong option is ""STINK"" (S, T, I, N, K). This uses S in position 1 (not 4), avoids A/R/O/E, and includes common letters T, I, N, K. 

I'll go with STINK.

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, E  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 4.

2. STINK → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters **not** in the word: T, K (added to A, R, O, E)  
   – Letter **S** is in the word but **not** in position 1.  
   – Letters **I** and **N** are in the word but in the **wrong positions**.

So far we know:
- Must contain: S, I, N  
- Must **not** contain: A, R, O, E, T, K  
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4.  
- I is **not** in position 3.  
- N is **not** in position 4.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are out and I is already in)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S, I, N  
- Avoids A, R, O, E, T, K  
- Avoids S in positions 1 or 4, I in position 3, N in position 4  
- Possibly includes U as the only remaining vowel

Let’s try to place S in position 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Let’s try I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Candidate words:
- **UNISS** – invalid (double S and N not used)  
- **SNIPS** – invalid (P and S in wrong positions)  
- **SINUS** – invalid (U and S in wrong positions)  
- **LUNGS** – uses L, U, N, G, S – but lacks I  
- **FUSIL** – uses F, U, S, I, L – but N is missing  
- **SUNNY** – uses S, U, N, N, Y – but I is missing  

We need a word that contains **S, I, N** and possibly **U**.  
Let’s try **USING**:
- Letters: U, S, I, N, G – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 2 (allowed)  
- I is in position 3 – **forbidden** (feedback said I is in wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3)  
So **USING** is invalid.

Next try **SINUS** – but N is in position 4, which is forbidden (from STINK feedback: N is in wrong position, so N cannot be in position 4).

Next try **LUNGS** – but lacks I.

Next try **FUSIL** – lacks N.

Next try **NIXIS** – invalid (X not common, double I).

Next try **MUSIN** – uses M, U, S, I, N – contains S, I, N  
- S is in position 3 (allowed)  
- I is in position 4 (allowed)  
- N is in position 5 (allowed)  
- No forbidden letters  
- All letters are from allowed set  

**MUSIN** seems valid.

But let me check if **MUSIN** is a recognized word – yes, it is a valid 5-letter English word (archaic for ""musical instrument"" or ""musical sound"").

So I'll go with **MUSIN**.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:
A, R, O, E, T, K, M, U

Letters known TO be in the word (but positions unknown):
S, I, N

Forbidden positional information:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5

Remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden letters):
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, I, N exactly once each
2. Uses only the remaining letters for the other two slots
3. Respects the positional bans above

Let’s list valid positions for each required letter:
- S: allowed positions 2, 5
- I: allowed positions 1, 2, 5
- N: allowed positions 1, 2, 3

We need to combine these sets while avoiding overlaps.

Possible placements:
- If N is in 1: then S can be 2 or 5, I can be 2 or 5 (but must avoid 3,4)
  - N S I _ _  → need two more letters
  - N I S _ _  → need two more letters
  - N _ S I _  → but I cannot be 4
  - N _ I S _  → but S cannot be 4
- If N is in 2: then S can be 2 (conflict) or 5, I can be 1,5
  - _ N S I _  → I at 4 is forbidden
  - _ N I S _  → valid
- If N is in 3: then S can be 2 or 5, I can be 1,2,5

Let’s explore the most promising pattern: _ N I S _ 
- First letter: must be from remaining (B,C,D,F,G,H,J,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z)
- Fifth letter: must be from remaining

We need a valid word of form ?NIS?
Looking through mental lexicon:
- B NIS? – no
- C NIS? – no
- D NIS? – no
- F NIS? – no
- G NIS? – no
- H NIS? – no
- J NIS? – no
- L NIS? – no
- P NIS? – no

- W NIS? – no
- X NIS? – no
- Y NIS? – no
- Z NIS? – no

None of these forms yield real words. Let’s try another pattern: _ _ N I S
- First two letters: from remaining
We need a word ending in NIS. Real words:
- BANIS – but A is forbidden
- CANIS – but C is allowed, A is forbidden
- DANIS – not a word
- FANIS – not a word
- GANIS – not a word
- HANIS – not a word
- JANIS – proper noun, not allowed
- LANIS – not a word
- PANIS – not a word
- VANIS – not a word

Next pattern: S in 2, N in 1, I in 5 → N S _ _ I
Need letters 3 and 4 from remaining set:

None of these are real words.

Next pattern: S in 5, N in 3, I in 2 → _ I N _ S
Need letters 1 and 4 from remaining set:
- ? I N ? S
Possible words:
- B I N D S – real word (British informal for ""bind"")
- C I N D S – no
- D I N D S – no
- F I N D S – real word (past tense of find)
- G I N D S – no
- H I N D S – no
- J I N D S – no

- P I N D S – no
- V I N D S – no
- W I N D S – real word (plural of wind)
- X I N D S – no
- Y I N D S – no
- Z I N D S – no

From these, the valid candidates are:
- Binds
- Finds
- Winds

All use only allowed letters and satisfy the constraints:
- B, F, W are in the allowed set
- I, N, S are present
- Positions:
  - Binds: B(1) I(2) N(3) D(4) S(5) → I not in 3,4; N not in 4,5; S not in 1,3,4
  - Finds: F(1) I(2) N(3) D(4) S(5) → same checks
  - Winds: W(1) I(2) N(3) D(4) S(5) → same checks

Among these, ""FINDS"" is the most common word. I'll choose that.

The feedback from FINDS shows:
- I is in the word and in the correct 2nd position.
- N is in the word and in the correct 3rd position.
- D is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- S is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So the word structure is now: _ I N D S.

We only need to determine the first letter. From previous feedback, the first letter cannot be:
- A, R, O, E, T, K, M, U, F (all eliminated)
- Also, from the positional bans, the first letter cannot be S, I, N, D (since they're already in positions 2-5).

Remaining possible first letters (from the full alphabet excluding all eliminated and used in place):
B, C, G, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in ""INDS"":
- BINDS
- FINDS (already tried, F is out)
- CINDS – not a common word
- GINDS – not a word
- HINDS – not standard
- LINDS – not standard
- PINDS – not standard
- WINDS – valid word

""WINDS"" fits all criteria: W is allowed, and the rest match the confirmed positions.
