### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and cover multiple vowels and consonants.

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because:
- It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T) which are all very common letters.
- The letters S, L, A, T, E appear in many 5-letter words, giving us good coverage for elimination.
- It doesn't repeat any letters, which helps test more unique letters.

This should provide a strong foundation for narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback received.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  In SLATE, E is at position 5, so the secret word must contain an E somewhere in positions 1-4.

We now need a word that:
1. Contains E (and not in position 5).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to keep narrowing down.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, D, C, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out).

Let’s pick a word that uses E plus common remaining letters.  
“CRIME” fits:
- Contains E in position 4 (not 5), so it satisfies the feedback.
- Uses C, R, I, M – none of which have been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use S, L, A, T.

This should help us learn more about the remaining letters.

From the new feedback on HONEY:
- H is correct in position 1 (✓).
- N is correct in position 3 (✓).
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓).
- O is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the pattern so far is:
H _ N _ Y
with E somewhere in positions 2 or 3. But position 3 is already N, so E must be in position 2.

Therefore the word must be: H E N _ Y

Now we just need to find the correct 4th letter. The remaining letters we haven't ruled out include: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding S, L, A, T, C, R, I, M, O).

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit H E N _ Y:
- HENNY (but N is already in position 3, and this would have N twice, which might be possible)
- HENGY (not a common word)
- HENBY (not common)
- HENDY (not common)
- HENNY is the only common one that comes to mind.

But let me check if HENNY is a valid word - yes, it's a proper noun (a name), and Wordle accepts names as valid answers.

So the most likely word is HENNY.
