### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- RAISE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- ROATE

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first choice because:
1. It contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A T _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Has T in position 4
- Contains both S and E somewhere else (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible words fitting _ _ A T _ with S and E elsewhere:
- STEAK (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T E A K - but this has A in 4, not 3)
- SATEY (but Y is uncommon)
- STATE (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T A T E - but T is repeated)
- SHADE (S H A D E - A in 3, T not present)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SCALE (but L is excluded)
- STAVE (but V not confirmed)
- STARE (S T A R E - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5 - this fits all constraints)

STARE fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (but feedback said S is not in position 1) - wait, this is a problem
- Actually, S is in the word but not in position 1, so STARE would have S in position 1 which contradicts feedback

Let me rethink:
We need S not in position 1, E not in position 5, A in 3, T in 4.

Possible words:
- HEATS (H E A T S - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5)
- BEATS (B E A T S - same as above)
- LEAPS (but L is excluded)

- TEASE (T E A S E - T in 1, not 4)
- SEATS (S E A T S - S in 1 and 5 - but S not in 1)
- REAPS (R E A P S - but P not confirmed)

HEATS seems best:
- H E A T S
- A in 3, T in 4
- S in 5 (but feedback says S is not in position 5, only that it's not in 1)
- E in 2 (not in 5, ok)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- RAISE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- ROATE

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first choice because:
1. It contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A T _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Has T in position 4
- Contains both S and E somewhere else (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible words fitting _ _ A T _ with S and E elsewhere:
- STEAK (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T E A K - but this has A in 4, not 3)
- SATEY (but Y is uncommon)
- STATE (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T A T E - but T is repeated)
- SHADE (S H A D E - A in 3, T not present)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SCALE (but L is excluded)
- STAVE (but V not confirmed)
- STARE (S T A R E - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5 - this fits all constraints)

STARE fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (but feedback said S is not in position 1) - wait, this is a problem
- Actually, S is in the word but not in position 1, so STARE would have S in position 1 which contradicts feedback

Let me rethink:
We need S not in position 1, E not in position 5, A in 3, T in 4.

Possible words:
- HEATS (H E A T S - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5)
- BEATS (B E A T S - same as above)
- LEAPS (but L is excluded)
- PEATS (P E A T S - P is acceptable)
- YEAST (Y E A S T - A in 3, T in 5 - but T must be in 4)
- TEASE (T E A S E - T in 1, not 4)
- SEATS (S E A T S - S in 1 and 5 - but S not in 1)
- REAPS (R E A P S - but P not confirmed)

HEATS seems best:
- H E A T S
- A in 3, T in 4
- S in 5 (but feedback says S is not in position 5, only that it's not in 1)
- E in 2 (not in 5, ok)
- No L
- Valid word

But HEATS has S in position 5 - the feedback only said S is not in position 1, so this is acceptable.

Another option:
- PEATS (P E A T S - same as HEATS but P)
- BEATS (B E A T S)

HEATS is the most common word here.Based on the feedback:
- A is in position 3
- T is in position 4
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L is not in the word

A good next guess is HEATS, as it places A and T correctly and includes S and E in valid positions.

From the new feedback on HEATS:
- H is not in the word
- E is in the word and in position 2
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- S is in the word and in position 5

So the pattern is now: _ E A T S

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already confirmed: E, A, T, S  
Letters already excluded: L, H  

We need a 5-letter word that ends in EATS and starts with a letter that has not been ruled out.  
Common first letters left: B, C, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.

Possible words:
- BEATS – but B not yet tested
- FEATS – F not yet tested
- GEATS – not a valid word
- PEATS – P not yet tested
- REATS – not a valid word
- SEATS – S already used in position 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Some good starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- RAISE
- ADIEU
- AUDIO
- ROATE

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" seems like a strong first choice because:
1. It contains very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words
3. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- E is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A T _  
Letters known to be in the word: S, A, T, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: L  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Has T in position 4
- Contains both S and E somewhere else (but S not in position 1, E not in position 5)
- Does not contain L

Possible words fitting _ _ A T _ with S and E elsewhere:
- STEAK (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T E A K - but this has A in 4, not 3)
- SATEY (but Y is uncommon)
- STATE (but A is position 3, T position 4: S T A T E - but T is repeated)
- SHADE (S H A D E - A in 3, T not present)
- SPEAT (not a valid word)
- SHATE (not a valid word)
- SWATE (not a valid word)
- SCALE (but L is excluded)
- STAVE (but V not confirmed)
- STARE (S T A R E - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5 - this fits all constraints)

STARE fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (but feedback said S is not in position 1) - wait, this is a problem
- Actually, S is in the word but not in position 1, so STARE would have S in position 1 which contradicts feedback

Let me rethink:
We need S not in position 1, E not in position 5, A in 3, T in 4.

Possible words:
- HEATS (H E A T S - A in 3, T in 4, S not in 1, E not in 5)
- BEATS (B E A T S - same as above)
- LEAPS (but L is excluded)
- PEATS (P E A T S - P is acceptable)
- YEAST (Y E A S T - A in 3, T in 5 - but T must be in 4)
- TEASE (T E A S E - T in 1, not 4)
- SEATS (S E A T S - S in 1 and 5 - but S not in 1)
- REAPS (R E A P S - but P not confirmed)

HEATS seems best:
- H E A T S
- A in 3, T in 4
- S in 5 (but feedback says S is not in position 5, only that it's not in 1)
- E in 2 (not in 5, ok)
- No L
- Valid word

But HEATS has S in position 5 - the feedback only said S is not in position 1, so this is acceptable.

Another option:
- PEATS (P E A T S - same as HEATS but P)
- BEATS (B E A T S)

HEATS is the most common word here.Based on the feedback:
- A is in position 3
- T is in position 4
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- E is in the word but not in position 5
- L is not in the word

A good next guess is HEATS, as it places A and T correctly and includes S and E in valid positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: HEATS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on HEATS:
- H is not in the word
- E is in the word and in position 2
- A is in the word and in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- S is in the word and in position 5

So the pattern is now: _ E A T S

Only the first letter is unknown.  
Letters already confirmed: E, A, T, S  
Letters already excluded: L, H  

We need a 5-letter word that ends in EATS and starts with a letter that has not been ruled out.  
Common first letters left: B, C, D, F, G, M, N, P, R, V, W, etc.

Possible words:
- BEATS – but B not yet tested
- FEATS – F not yet tested
- GEATS – not a valid word
- PEATS – P not yet tested
- REATS – not a valid word
- SEATS – S already used in position 5
- VEATS – not a valid word
- WEATS – not a valid word
- CRETS – doesn’t end in EATS
- BRETS – no
- TREKS – no

The most common valid word fitting _EATS is BEATS.  
Since B has not been excluded, BEATS is a strong candidate.

We now know the word is _ E A T S and the first letter is NOT: L, H, B, F, M.

Still-valid starting letters (common ones): C, D, G, N, P, R, V, W, Y.

Possible 5-letter words ending in EATS:
- CEATS – not valid
- DEATS – not valid
- GEATS – not valid
- NEATS – valid
- PEATS – valid
- REATS – not valid
- VEATS – not valid
- WEATS – not valid
- YEATS – proper noun, usually invalid

Between NEATS and PEATS, NEATS is more common and P hasn’t been ruled out yet (only F and M, etc.). So NEATS is the next logical guess.
