For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word has an A in position 3.
- It contains an L somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3 and an L somewhere else. We also want to introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities. Good candidates include R, N, I, O, C, etc.

A word like ""CLAMP"" would fit:
- C: new consonant
- L: known to be in the word (but position 2 is allowed since L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked wrong, so position 1 is ok)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

But let's think of a word where L is not in position 2. ""FLANK"" would have L in position 2 again, which is same as SLATE. ""PLANK"" same issue. ""CLANK"" same.

""CLASP"" has L in position 2 again. ""CLAM"" is 4 letters. ""CLAMP"" has L in position 2. 

""PLANT"" has T which we know is out. ""PLANK"" has K which is ok.

Wait, let's think differently. We need L not in position 2. So possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.

A word like ""CLANG"" has L in position 2 again. Not good.

""PLAGU"" is not a word. ""PLAID"" has L in position 2. 

""GLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLARY"" has L in position 2. 

""ALARM"" has L in position 2. 

""FLANK"" again L in position 2. 

""BLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLASP"" again L in position 2. 

""PLANS"" has S which is out. 

""PLANT"" has T out. 

""CLAMP"" L in position 2. 

This seems like a lot of words with L in position 2. Maybe we need to look for words where L is in position 1, 4, or 5.

""LAUGH"" has L in position 1. A in position 3. U is new. G and H are new. This seems good.

""LAUGH"" - L in position 1 (not position 2), A in position 3, and introduces U, G, H.

Another option: ""LARKS"" - but S is out. 

""LABOR"" - O and R are new, but L is in position 1, A in 3. 

""LABOR"" seems good: L in 1, A in 3, O and R are new, B is new.

But ""LABOR"" has O and R, which are good letters. 

""LAUGH"" has U, G, H. 

Between ""LABOR"" and ""LAUGH"", ""LAUGH"" introduces more new letters (U, G, H vs O, R, B). 

So I'll go with ""LAUGH"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has A in position 3 (from SLATE).

   - L is NOT in position 1 (from LAUGH)

   - L is NOT in position 3 (A is there)
   Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, U, G, H.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Remaining frequent letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next word should:
- keep A in position 3
- place L in position 4 or 5
- introduce as many new, common letters as possible

Candidate words:
- PLAIN → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLAMP → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- BLAND → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLANG → L in position 2 (invalid)

Now consider words with L in position 4 or 5:

- CRANE → L not present
- DRANK → L not present
- BRAND → L not present
- PRANK → L not present
- CLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)

Wait, let’s construct a word with L in position 4 or 5:

- C A R L _ → CARL_ needs a 5th letter; CARLS (S out), CARLY (Y uncommon), CARLA (A already used)
- C A P L _ → CAPL_ → CAPLE (E out), CAPLS (S out)
- C A R _ L → CAR_L → CAROL (O is new, L in position 5) – this looks good
   - CAROL: C, A, R, O, L
     - A is in position 3 (✓)
     - L is in position 5 (new position, not 1 or 2) (✓)
     - Introduces C, R, O (all new, common letters) (✓)

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, CAROL is a strong next guess.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word has an A in position 3.
- It contains an L somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3 and an L somewhere else. We also want to introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities. Good candidates include R, N, I, O, C, etc.

A word like ""CLAMP"" would fit:
- C: new consonant
- L: known to be in the word (but position 2 is allowed since L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked wrong, so position 1 is ok)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

But let's think of a word where L is not in position 2. ""FLANK"" would have L in position 2 again, which is same as SLATE. ""PLANK"" same issue. ""CLANK"" same.

""CLASP"" has L in position 2 again. ""CLAM"" is 4 letters. ""CLAMP"" has L in position 2. 

""PLANT"" has T which we know is out. ""PLANK"" has K which is ok.

Wait, let's think differently. We need L not in position 2. So possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.

A word like ""CLANG"" has L in position 2 again. Not good.

""PLAGU"" is not a word. ""PLAID"" has L in position 2. 

""GLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLARY"" has L in position 2. 

""ALARM"" has L in position 2. 

""FLANK"" again L in position 2. 

""BLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLASP"" again L in position 2. 

""PLANS"" has S which is out. 

""PLANT"" has T out. 

""CLAMP"" L in position 2. 

This seems like a lot of words with L in position 2. Maybe we need to look for words where L is in position 1, 4, or 5.

""LAUGH"" has L in position 1. A in position 3. U is new. G and H are new. This seems good.

""LAUGH"" - L in position 1 (not position 2), A in position 3, and introduces U, G, H.

Another option: ""LARKS"" - but S is out. 

""LABOR"" - O and R are new, but L is in position 1, A in 3. 

""LABOR"" seems good: L in 1, A in 3, O and R are new, B is new.

But ""LABOR"" has O and R, which are good letters. 

""LAUGH"" has U, G, H. 

Between ""LABOR"" and ""LAUGH"", ""LAUGH"" introduces more new letters (U, G, H vs O, R, B). 

So I'll go with ""LAUGH"" as the next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has A in position 3 (from SLATE).
2. It contains L somewhere, but:
   - L is NOT in position 1 (from LAUGH)
   - L is NOT in position 2 (from SLATE)
   - L is NOT in position 3 (A is there)
   Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, U, G, H.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Remaining frequent letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next word should:
- keep A in position 3
- place L in position 4 or 5
- introduce as many new, common letters as possible

Candidate words:
- PLAIN → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLAMP → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- BLAND → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLANG → L in position 2 (invalid)

Now consider words with L in position 4 or 5:

- CRANE → L not present
- DRANK → L not present
- BRAND → L not present
- PRANK → L not present
- CLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)

Wait, let’s construct a word with L in position 4 or 5:

- C A R L _ → CARL_ needs a 5th letter; CARLS (S out), CARLY (Y uncommon), CARLA (A already used)
- C A P L _ → CAPL_ → CAPLE (E out), CAPLS (S out)

     - L is in position 5 (new position, not 1 or 2) (✓)
     - Introduces C, R, O (all new, common letters) (✓)

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, CAROL is a strong next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Position 3 is NOT A (it was marked ✓ in SLATE, but then marked – in CAROL).  
   Therefore A is NOT in position 3.

2. The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it was marked – in SLATE, LAUGH, and CAROL).  
   That leaves only position 3 for L.  
   So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _

3. Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R.

4. Letters still in play (from remaining common letters):  
   B, D, F, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

5. From CAROL we also learned that O is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked –), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ _ L _ _
- Must contain O (not in position 4)
- No S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R

Let's list possible positions for O:
- Position 1: O _ L _ _
- Position 2: _ O L _ _
- Position 5: _ _ L _ O

We also need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- O _ L _ _: O B L I N → ""OBLIN"" (valid word, letters O, B, L, I, N – none eliminated)
- _ O L _ _: B O L I N → ""BOLIN"" (valid, but less common)
- _ _ L _ O: B I L K O → ""BILKO"" (valid, but K is less common)

Among these, ""OBLIN"" seems the most straightforward and uses common letters.

- B, L, I, N – none are eliminated
- L in position 3 (required by the – feedback)
- No eliminated letters used

Wait, let's think differently. We need L not in position 2. So possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.

""CLAMP"" L in position 2. 

This seems like a lot of words with L in position 2. Maybe we need to look for words where L is in position 1, 4, or 5.

""LAUGH"" has L in position 1. A in position 3. U is new. G and H are new. This seems good.

""LAUGH"" - L in position 1 (not position 2), A in position 3, and introduces U, G, H.

<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Position 3 is NOT A (it was marked ✓ in SLATE, but then marked – in CAROL).  
   Therefore A is NOT in position 3.

2. The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it was marked – in SLATE, LAUGH, and CAROL).  
   That leaves only position 3 for L.  
   So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _

3. Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R.

4. Letters still in play (from remaining common letters):  
   B, D, F, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

5. From CAROL we also learned that O is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked –), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ _ L _ _
- Must contain O (not in position 4)
- No S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R

Let's list possible positions for O:
- Position 1: O _ L _ _
- Position 2: _ O L _ _
- Position 5: _ _ L _ O

We also need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- O _ L _ _: O B L I N → ""OBLIN"" (valid word, letters O, B, L, I, N – none eliminated)
- _ O L _ _: B O L I N → ""BOLIN"" (valid, but less common)
- _ _ L _ O: B I L K O → ""BILKO"" (valid, but K is less common)

Among these, ""OBLIN"" seems the most straightforward and uses common letters.

Let's verify:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- B, L, I, N – none are eliminated
- L in position 3 (required by the – feedback)
- No eliminated letters used

Let’s tabulate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters OUT (never appear):
S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R, B, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word:
- L  (it has been marked “in word but wrong position” four times so far, which is only possible if it is the only remaining slot it can occupy)

Positions ruled out for L:
- SLATE: pos 2
- LAUGH: pos 1
- CAROL: pos 5
- OBLIN: pos 3

Therefore L must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L _

Additional constraints:
- O was marked “in word but wrong position” in both CAROL (pos 4) and OBLIN (pos 1), so O must be in position 2 or 5.
- No other vowels (A, E, I, U) are confirmed; consonants still allowed include D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s build the word:
- _ O _ L _  or  _ _ _ L O

Testing the first pattern (_ O _ L _):
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 3, from the still-allowed set {D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y}.  
A quick valid combination is D O M L Y → “DOMLY” (rare) or F O M L Y → “FOMLY” (invalid).  
A real word that fits: F O W L Y → “FOWLY” (archaic spelling of “fowl”), but it’s obscure.

Testing the second pattern (_ _ _ L O):
We need three consonants for positions 1, 2, 3.  
A common word: D R _ L O – but R is out.  
F L _ L O – L repeats.  
M _ _ L O: M A _ L O – A is out.  
P _ _ L O: P A _ L O – A is out.  
F _ _ L O: F O W L O – O repeats.  
D _ _ L O: D O M L O – O repeats.  

A valid word that avoids all banned letters and fits _ _ _ L O is “FOLLY”:
- F, O, L, L, Y → but L repeats, and we only know one L exists.

Instead, let’s use _ O _ L _ with distinct letters:  
F O W L Y is too rare.  
D O M L Y is not a standard word.  
The best common word that fits _ _ _ L _ without repeats is “FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” is acceptable in Scrabble lists.

However, a more common and unambiguous fit is “FOLLY” even with the double L, because the puzzle allows repeated letters if they exist in the target word.  
But we have no evidence of double-L, so let’s stick to single-L.

A safer choice is “FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” (5 letters, valid).

But let’s check another: “MOLLY” – M, O, L, L, Y. Again double-L.

A word without repeats and fitting _ _ _ L _ is “FOWLY”.

Another candidate: “WOLLY” – W, O, L, L, Y – double-L.

“POLLY” – P, O, L, L, Y – double-L.

“HOLLY” – H is out.

“JOLLY” – J is allowed (not yet excluded), but rare.

“DOILY” – D, O, I, L, Y – I is out.

“FOULY” – U is out.

“FOGLY” – G is out.

“FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” seems the only common 5-letter word left in this pattern.

Thus, the logical next guess is:

<guess>FOWLY</guess>

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""AUDIO,"" etc. These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word and in the correct 3rd position (✓).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word has an A in position 3.
- It contains an L somewhere, but NOT in position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 3 and an L somewhere else. We also want to introduce new common consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities. Good candidates include R, N, I, O, C, etc.

A word like ""CLAMP"" would fit:
- C: new consonant
- L: known to be in the word (but position 2 is allowed since L was in position 2 in SLATE and marked wrong, so position 1 is ok)
- A: correct in position 3
- M: new consonant
- P: new consonant

But let's think of a word where L is not in position 2. ""FLANK"" would have L in position 2 again, which is same as SLATE. ""PLANK"" same issue. ""CLANK"" same.

""CLASP"" has L in position 2 again. ""CLAM"" is 4 letters. ""CLAMP"" has L in position 2. 

""PLANT"" has T which we know is out. ""PLANK"" has K which is ok.

Wait, let's think differently. We need L not in position 2. So possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, or 5. But 3 is A, so 1, 4, or 5.

A word like ""CLANG"" has L in position 2 again. Not good.

""PLAGU"" is not a word. ""PLAID"" has L in position 2. 

""GLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLARY"" has L in position 2. 

""ALARM"" has L in position 2. 

""FLANK"" again L in position 2. 

""BLAND"" has L in position 2. 

""CLASP"" again L in position 2. 

""PLANS"" has S which is out. 

""PLANT"" has T out. 

""CLAMP"" L in position 2. 

This seems like a lot of words with L in position 2. Maybe we need to look for words where L is in position 1, 4, or 5.

""LAUGH"" has L in position 1. A in position 3. U is new. G and H are new. This seems good.

""LAUGH"" - L in position 1 (not position 2), A in position 3, and introduces U, G, H.

Another option: ""LARKS"" - but S is out. 

""LABOR"" - O and R are new, but L is in position 1, A in 3. 

""LABOR"" seems good: L in 1, A in 3, O and R are new, B is new.

But ""LABOR"" has O and R, which are good letters. 

""LAUGH"" has U, G, H. 

Between ""LABOR"" and ""LAUGH"", ""LAUGH"" introduces more new letters (U, G, H vs O, R, B). 

So I'll go with ""LAUGH"" as the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LAUGH -> FEEDBACK: L(-) A(-) U(x) G(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word has A in position 3 (from SLATE).
2. It contains L somewhere, but:
   - L is NOT in position 1 (from LAUGH)
   - L is NOT in position 2 (from SLATE)
   - L is NOT in position 3 (A is there)
   Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, U, G, H.
4. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. Remaining frequent letters: R, N, I, O, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next word should:
- keep A in position 3
- place L in position 4 or 5
- introduce as many new, common letters as possible

Candidate words:
- PLAIN → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLAMP → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- BLAND → L in position 2 (invalid)
- PLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- CLANG → L in position 2 (invalid)

Now consider words with L in position 4 or 5:

- CRANE → L not present
- DRANK → L not present
- BRAND → L not present
- PRANK → L not present
- CLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)
- FLANK → L in position 2 (invalid)

Wait, let’s construct a word with L in position 4 or 5:

- C A R L _ → CARL_ needs a 5th letter; CARLS (S out), CARLY (Y uncommon), CARLA (A already used)
- C A P L _ → CAPL_ → CAPLE (E out), CAPLS (S out)
- C A R _ L → CAR_L → CAROL (O is new, L in position 5) – this looks good
   - CAROL: C, A, R, O, L
     - A is in position 3 (✓)
     - L is in position 5 (new position, not 1 or 2) (✓)
     - Introduces C, R, O (all new, common letters) (✓)

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Therefore, CAROL is a strong next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Position 3 is NOT A (it was marked ✓ in SLATE, but then marked – in CAROL).  
   Therefore A is NOT in position 3.

2. The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (it was marked – in SLATE, LAUGH, and CAROL).  
   That leaves only position 3 for L.  
   So the pattern is: _ _ L _ _

3. Letters that are OUT: S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R.

4. Letters still in play (from remaining common letters):  
   B, D, F, I, K, M, N, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

5. From CAROL we also learned that O is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked –), so O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ _ L _ _
- Must contain O (not in position 4)
- No S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R

Let's list possible positions for O:
- Position 1: O _ L _ _
- Position 2: _ O L _ _
- Position 5: _ _ L _ O

We also need to fill the remaining slots with letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- O _ L _ _: O B L I N → ""OBLIN"" (valid word, letters O, B, L, I, N – none eliminated)
- _ O L _ _: B O L I N → ""BOLIN"" (valid, but less common)
- _ _ L _ O: B I L K O → ""BILKO"" (valid, but K is less common)

Among these, ""OBLIN"" seems the most straightforward and uses common letters.

Let's verify:
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- B, L, I, N – none are eliminated
- L in position 3 (required by the – feedback)
- No eliminated letters used

Let’s tabulate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters OUT (never appear):
S, T, E, U, G, H, C, R, B, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word:
- L  (it has been marked “in word but wrong position” four times so far, which is only possible if it is the only remaining slot it can occupy)

Positions ruled out for L:
- SLATE: pos 2
- LAUGH: pos 1
- CAROL: pos 5
- OBLIN: pos 3

Therefore L must be in position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ L _

Additional constraints:
- O was marked “in word but wrong position” in both CAROL (pos 4) and OBLIN (pos 1), so O must be in position 2 or 5.
- No other vowels (A, E, I, U) are confirmed; consonants still allowed include D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s build the word:
- _ O _ L _  or  _ _ _ L O

Testing the first pattern (_ O _ L _):
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 3, from the still-allowed set {D, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y}.  
A quick valid combination is D O M L Y → “DOMLY” (rare) or F O M L Y → “FOMLY” (invalid).  
A real word that fits: F O W L Y → “FOWLY” (archaic spelling of “fowl”), but it’s obscure.

Testing the second pattern (_ _ _ L O):
We need three consonants for positions 1, 2, 3.  
A common word: D R _ L O – but R is out.  
F L _ L O – L repeats.  
M _ _ L O: M A _ L O – A is out.  
P _ _ L O: P A _ L O – A is out.  
F _ _ L O: F O W L O – O repeats.  
D _ _ L O: D O M L O – O repeats.  

A valid word that avoids all banned letters and fits _ _ _ L O is “FOLLY”:
- F, O, L, L, Y → but L repeats, and we only know one L exists.

Instead, let’s use _ O _ L _ with distinct letters:  
F O W L Y is too rare.  
D O M L Y is not a standard word.  
The best common word that fits _ _ _ L _ without repeats is “FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” is acceptable in Scrabble lists.

However, a more common and unambiguous fit is “FOLLY” even with the double L, because the puzzle allows repeated letters if they exist in the target word.  
But we have no evidence of double-L, so let’s stick to single-L.

A safer choice is “FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” (5 letters, valid).

But let’s check another: “MOLLY” – M, O, L, L, Y. Again double-L.

A word without repeats and fitting _ _ _ L _ is “FOWLY”.

Another candidate: “WOLLY” – W, O, L, L, Y – double-L.

“POLLY” – P, O, L, L, Y – double-L.

“HOLLY” – H is out.

“JOLLY” – J is allowed (not yet excluded), but rare.

“DOILY” – D, O, I, L, Y – I is out.

“FOULY” – U is out.

“FOGLY” – G is out.

“FOWL” + Y → “FOWLY” seems the only common 5-letter word left in this pattern.

Thus, the logical next guess is:

<guess>FOWLY</guess>
