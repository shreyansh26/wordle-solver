Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- A: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- O: x (not in the word)

A balanced word that fits is ""TRIUM"" (though M is less common, it helps test new letters). But ""TRIUM"" has U, which is a good vowel to test. Another option is ""DRINK"" (D, R, I, N, K). Let me choose ""DRINK"" as it tests D, I, N, K, and keeps R in position 2.

The feedback on “drum” says “Model answer is not five letters,” which is a bit ambiguous, but since we already know the pattern is D R _ _ _, and drum itself is only four letters, it’s probably just clarifying that the answer must be five letters. So we should continue with the D R _ _ _ pattern.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, I, N, K.

Remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (Y can act as a vowel)

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Let’s try common combinations.  
“DRUM” was four letters, so let’s add a letter to make it five. A common suffix could be “-Y” or “-L” or “-P”.

“DRUM” → “DRUMP” isn’t a word.  
“DRUM” → “DRUMS” uses S, which is already eliminated.  
“DRUM” → “DRUMY” isn’t standard.  
“DRUM” → “DRUM” + “L” → “DRUML” isn’t valid.  

Let’s pick a different set of letters. We need two new letters from the remaining pool. Let’s try C and H: “D R C H _” – no good.  
How about “D R U M” + a letter? “DRUM” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with DR and avoiding eliminated letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with DR and avoiding A, O, S, E, I, N, K:  
- DRUM + Y → “DRUMY” (valid, though rare)  
- “DRUPT” (not a word)  
- “DRY” + two letters: “D R Y _ _” – but we already have D R.  

Wait, let’s list valid words:  
- “DRUM” is 4, so we need 5-letter words.  
- “DROOP” – O is out.  
- “DRIFT” – I is out.  
- “DRANK” – A, N, K are out.

Actually, let’s just pick two new letters from the remaining pool and form a word. Let’s try U and M: “D R U M” + a letter. “DRUM” is 4, so we need a 5-letter word.  

A valid word is “DRUM” + “P” → “DRUMP” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try “D R U M” + “Y” → “DRUMY” (valid, though uncommon).

Let’s try “D R U M” + “T” → “DRUMT” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try “D R U M” + “L” → “DRUML” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try a different approach: we need a 5-letter word starting with DR, with no A, O, S, E, I, N, K.  

Valid letters left: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  

Possible combinations:

<guess>drumy</guess>",drumy,"The feedback on “drum” says “Model answer is not five letters,” which is a bit ambiguous, but since we already know the pattern is D R _ _ _, and drum itself is only four letters, it’s probably just clarifying that the answer must be five letters.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- O: x (not in the word)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So we know:
- The word has R in position 2.
- The letters A, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word with R in the 2nd position, and none of A, O, S, E. We should also include other common letters to test new possibilities. Good remaining consonants include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels include I, U.

A balanced word that fits is ""TRIUM"" (though M is less common, it helps test new letters). But ""TRIUM"" has U, which is a good vowel to test. Another option is ""DRINK"" (D, R, I, N, K). Let me choose ""DRINK"" as it tests D, I, N, K, and keeps R in position 2.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. R is in position 2 (from both arose and drink).
2. D is in position 1 (from drink).
3. The letters A, O, S, E, I, N, K are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
D R _ _ _

We need three more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, E, I, N, K  
Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (Y can act as a vowel)

A good next word would use new, common letters while preserving the known D-R prefix.  
“DRUM” uses M and U, both still possible.  
“DRUM” is a valid 5-letter word and tests two new letters at once.

A balanced word that fits is ""TRIUM"" (though M is less common, it helps test new letters). But ""TRIUM"" has U, which is a good vowel to test. Another option is ""DRINK"" (D, R, I, N, K). Let me choose ""DRINK"" as it tests D, I, N, K, and keeps R in position 2.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: drink -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(x) K(x)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. R is in position 2 (from both arose and drink).
2. D is in position 1 (from drink).
3. The letters A, O, S, E, I, N, K are **not** in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
D R _ _ _

We need three more letters that have not been ruled out.  
Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, E, I, N, K  
Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (Y can act as a vowel)

A good next word would use new, common letters while preserving the known D-R prefix.  
“DRUM” uses M and U, both still possible.  
“DRUM” is a valid 5-letter word and tests two new letters at once.

The feedback on “drum” says “Model answer is not five letters,” which is a bit ambiguous, but since we already know the pattern is D R _ _ _, and drum itself is only four letters, it’s probably just clarifying that the answer must be five letters. So we should continue with the D R _ _ _ pattern.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S, E, I, N, K.

Remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (Y can act as a vowel)

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Let’s try common combinations.  
“DRUM” was four letters, so let’s add a letter to make it five. A common suffix could be “-Y” or “-L” or “-P”.

“DRUM” → “DRUMP” isn’t a word.  
“DRUM” → “DRUMS” uses S, which is already eliminated.  
“DRUM” → “DRUMY” isn’t standard.  
“DRUM” → “DRUM” + “L” → “DRUML” isn’t valid.  

Let’s pick a different set of letters. We need two new letters from the remaining pool. Let’s try C and H: “D R C H _” – no good.  
How about “D R U M” + a letter? “DRUM” is 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word starting with DR and avoiding eliminated letters.

Valid 5-letter words starting with DR and avoiding A, O, S, E, I, N, K:  
- DRUM + Y → “DRUMY” (valid, though rare)  
- “DRUPT” (not a word)  
- “DRY” + two letters: “D R Y _ _” – but we already have D R.  

Wait, let’s list valid words:  
- “DRUM” is 4, so we need 5-letter words.  
- “DROOP” – O is out.  
- “DRIFT” – I is out.  
- “DRANK” – A, N, K are out.  
- “DREAD” – A, E are out.  
- “DROVE” – O, E are out.  
- “DRUM” is 4, so we need to think differently.  

Actually, let’s just pick two new letters from the remaining pool and form a word. Let’s try U and M: “D R U M” + a letter. “DRUM” is 4, so we need a 5-letter word.  

A valid word is “DRUM” + “P” → “DRUMP” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try “D R U M” + “Y” → “DRUMY” (valid, though uncommon).  

Another option is “D R U M” + “S” → but S is out.  

Let’s try “D R U M” + “T” → “DRUMT” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try “D R U M” + “L” → “DRUML” isn’t valid.  

Let’s try a different approach: we need a 5-letter word starting with DR, with no A, O, S, E, I, N, K.  

Valid letters left: C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y  

Possible combinations:  
- D R U M _ → “DRUM” + Y → “DRUMY”  
- D R U P _ → “DRUP_” – no.  
- D R U C _ → “DRUCC” – no.  
- D R U G _ → “DRUG_” – “DRUGS” has S.  
- D R U B _ → “DRUB_” – no.  

“DRUMY” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with DR that uses remaining letters. Let’s go with that.

So far we have:

- Position 1: D (✓)
- Position 2: R (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 4: M (x) → M is NOT in the word
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Thus the pattern is: D R U _ Y

Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, E, I, N, K, M

Remaining possible letters for position 4: from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones.
Available letters: B, C, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W

We need a 5-letter word that starts with DRU and ends with Y, with one letter in between.

Possible English words:
- DRU _ Y

Looking at the options:
- DRU B Y → ""druby"" – not a valid word
- DRU C Y → ""drucy"" – not a word
- DRU F Y → ""drufy"" – not a word
- DRU G Y → ""drugy"" – not standard
- DRU H Y → ""druhy"" – not a word
- DRU L Y → ""druly"" – not a word
- DRU P Y → ""drupy"" – valid (botany term for a type of fruit)
- DRU T Y → ""drut y"" – not a word
- DRU V Y → ""druvy"" – not a word
- DRU W Y → ""druw y"" – not a word

The only valid word from the remaining letters is ""DRUPY"".

Let's verify:
- D(✓) R(✓) U(✓) P _ Y
- P is not yet eliminated (it hasn't been used)
- ""DRUPY"" is a valid 5-letter English word (though uncommon, it's recognized in botanical contexts)

Therefore, the next guess should be ""DRUPY"".
