### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.  
We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.  
Good next letters to try are R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.

A word that uses five new common letters while keeping E in the final spot is “CRONE”.  
It introduces C, R, O, N, and keeps E in place.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best strategy is to pick a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. Some good starting words include SLATE, CRANE, or ADIEU. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of S, L, A, T.  
We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.  
Good next letters to try are R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.

A word that uses five new common letters while keeping E in the final spot is “CRONE”.  
It introduces C, R, O, N, and keeps E in place.

From the two guesses we know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. The word contains C, R, O in positions 1-3 (exact order unknown).
3. S, L, A, T, N are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ E  
and the first four letters must be some permutation of C, R, O plus one more letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Letters already used and ruled out: S, L, A, T, N  
Letters already confirmed present: C, R, O, E (with E fixed at position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- contains C, R, O in positions 1-4 (order unknown)
- uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still available: I, U (since A is out, and E is already used)

Let’s try to place C, R, O in different positions while introducing a new consonant.  
A good candidate is “CORGE”:
- C in position 1 (✓)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (✓)
- G is a new consonant not yet tested.
- E is fixed in position 5.

This tests G and keeps C, O, R in their previously confirmed positions.

We now have four guesses’ worth of feedback:

2. CRONE → C, R, O, E are correct; N is not in the word.

4. CROPE → C, R, O, E are correct; P is not in the word.

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ E

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still available: I, U (A is out, E is fixed, O is present)

We need to place R and O in positions 2-4, with:
- O not in position 2 (from CORGE feedback)
- R not in position 3 (from CORGE feedback)
- R not in position 2 (from CROPE feedback)

Therefore:
- R must be in position 4 (only remaining spot not excluded)
- O must be in position 3 (only remaining spot not excluded)

So the word must be: C _ O R E

The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet ruled out.  
From remaining consonants, a common one is D, giving the word “C D O R E” → “CORDE”.

Let’s check:
- C (✓) in 1

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From all five guesses we now have:

1. SLATE → E is correct in position 5.
2. CRONE → C, R, O, E are correct; N is not in the word.
3. CORGE → C, E are correct; O is in the word but not in position 2; R is in the word but not in position 3; G is not in the word.
4. CROPE → C, R, O, E are correct; P is not in the word.
5. CORDE → C, E are correct; O is in the word but not in position 2; R is in the word but not in position 3; D is not in the word.

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ E  
and the letters R and O must appear in positions 2, 3, or 4, with the constraints:
- O cannot be in position 2
- R cannot be in position 3
- From CROPE and CORDE, P and D are not in the word.

The only remaining positions for R and O are:
- R must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 3 and has already been tested in 2 as wrong)
- O must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 2 and 4 is taken by R)

Thus the word must be: C _ O R E

The blank (position 2) must be a consonant not yet ruled out. From the remaining consonants (excluding S, L, A, T, N, G, P, D), possible choices are B, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. The most common among these is B, giving the word ""C B O R E"" which is ""CORBE"". However, ""CORBE"" is not a standard English word. The next common consonant is M, giving ""COMRE"", which is also not a word. The next is F, giving ""COFRE"", which is not valid. The next is H, giving ""COHRE"", which is not valid. The next is K, giving ""COKRE"", not valid. The next is V, giving ""COVRE"", not valid. The next is Y, giving ""COYRE"", not valid. The next is Z, giving ""COZRE"", not valid. 

Looking back, we might have missed that position 2 could be another letter. However, all remaining consonants seem to lead to non-words. Rechecking, the only valid English word that fits C _ O R E is ""CORER"". Let's verify:
- C in position 1 (✓)
- O in position 3 (✓, not in position 2)
- R in position 4 (✓, not in position 3)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- The letter in position 2 is R, but R is already in position 4. This would duplicate R, which is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. However, in our feedback, R has only been confirmed as present, not necessarily unique. 

But ""CORER"" would have R in positions 2 and 4, which is acceptable. Let's check if ""CORER"" is a valid word - yes, it is.

Thus, the correct word must be ""CORER"".
