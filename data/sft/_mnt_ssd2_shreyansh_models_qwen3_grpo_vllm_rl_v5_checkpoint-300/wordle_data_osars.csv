For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x): T is not in the word.

- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already A), so positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid L, T, E.

Let's digest the new feedback.

Previous knowledge:
- A is in position 3 (from SLATE and CHASM).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from SLATE, CHASM, RASPY).
- Therefore S must be in position 5.
- Letters L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y are NOT in the word.

Current skeleton:
_ _ A _ S

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

From RASPY we also learned:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from R(-)).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know it's in position 3, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already knew it's in position 5).
- P and Y are not in the word.

So we need:
- Position 1: not R (from R(-)), and must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 2: not A (from A(-)), and must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

Looking for words that fit _ _ A _ S and use allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGAS (but G and second A are allowed, but this seems less likely)
- DAGOS (but O and second S is already fixed)
- FAKES (but E is excluded)
- GADID (but ends with D, not S)
- KABAS (but second A is allowed, but this seems odd)
- NADIS (but ends with S, and I is allowed)
- RADIS (but R is allowed in position 1? Wait, R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.)

Actually, R is in the word but not in position 1, so R must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible structures:
- _ R A _ S (R in position 2)
- _ _ A R S (R in position 4)

Let's explore these.

1. _ R A _ S:
   - Position 1: allowed letters (not R, and not any excluded letters)
   - Position 4: allowed letters
   Possible words: BRADS, CRADS (but C is excluded), DRAMS (M excluded), FRADS, GRADS, etc.
   - BRADS: B, R, A, D, S - all letters allowed
   - GRADS: G, R, A, D, S - all letters allowed

2. _ _ A R S:
   - Position 1 and 2: allowed letters
   Possible words: BURAS (but U is allowed), DARAS (but D and second A), FARAS (F and second A), etc.
   - FARAS: F, A, R, A, S - but A is in position 2, which is allowed (A(-) only said A is not in position 2 in RASPY, but that was in position 2 of RASPY which is position 1 here - need to check if A can be in position 2)
   - Actually, in RASPY, A was in position 2 with feedback A(-), meaning A is not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.

So for _ _ A R S, position 2 cannot be A, so possible:
- BURAS: but U is allowed, but this seems like a stretch
- DIRAS: D, I, R, A, S - but A is in position 4, which is allowed
- FIRAS: F, I, R, A, S - same issue with A in position 4

But in _ _ A R S, position 3 is A, position 4 is R, position 5 is S. So position 2 can be any allowed letter except A (since A(-) in RASPY only applies to position 2 in RASPY, which is position 1 here - actually, positions are 1-based, so in RASPY, R was position 1, A position 2, S position 3, P position 4, Y position 5. So A(-) means A is not in position 2 of the word, which is position 2 - so position 2 cannot be A.

Thus for _ _ A R S, position 2 can be any allowed letter except A.

Looking at _ R A _ S:
- BRADS: B, R, A, D, S - all allowed
- GRADS: G, R, A, D, S - all allowed
- FRADS: F, R, A, D, S - all allowed

These seem like strong candidates. Between these, GRADS is a common word, and all letters are allowed.

Let's verify:
- G: not excluded
- R: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 2) - ok
- A: in position 3 - ok
- D: not excluded
- S: in position 5 - ok

No excluded letters are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an A in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S, but S cannot be in position 1.
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 1.
3. Does not contain L, T, or E.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of words that fit:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already A), so positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid L, T, E.

Some candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is okay, but S is in position 4)
- BASSY (but S is in position 2 and 4)
- CHASM (S in position 4)
- DRANK (but no S)
- GRASP (S in position 4)

I'll go with ""CHASM"" because:
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 4 (not position 1, so allowed)
- Contains C, H, M which are new letters to test
- Doesn't contain L, T, or E

Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.

Remaining letters to try (excluding L,T,E,C,H,M): B,D,F,G,I,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

- A(✓): A is in position 3 (already known).
- D(x): D is NOT in the word.
- S(✓): S is in position 5 (already known).

So we now know the word must be of the form:

with the constraints:
- S is in position 5 (fixed).
- A is in position 3 (fixed).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from RASPY and GRADS feedback).
  - Therefore R must be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.
  - This is impossible, which means our earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the R feedback carefully:

From RASPY: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
From GRADS: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
But position 3 is A, position 5 is S, so R must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ _ A R S

Now we need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ARS and does not contain any of the excluded letters: L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y, G, D.

Allowed letters: B, F, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus A and S which are fixed).

Possible words ending in ARS:
- BURAS (but U is allowed, but this seems like a stretch)
- FAROS (but O and S are allowed, but this ends with OS, not ARS)
- KARAS (K, A, R, A, S - but A is in position 2, which was marked A(-) in RASPY, meaning A is not in position 2. So this is invalid)
- NARAS (N, A, R, A, S - same issue with A in position 2)
- WARDS (but D is excluded)
- ZARAS (Z, A, R, A, S - again A in position 2 is invalid)

Looking at _ _ A R S with no A in position 2:

Possible candidates:
- BURAS (B, U, A, R, S) - but A is in position 3, so this would be B U A R S - but that's 5 letters: BURAS. However, A is in position 3 here, so this fits _ U A R S. But BURAS is a valid word meaning a coin or currency. Let's check letters: B, U, A, R, S - none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an A in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S, but S cannot be in position 1.
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Now I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Contains S somewhere other than position 1.
3. Does not contain L, T, or E.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of words that fit:
- A is fixed in position 3.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already A), so positions 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid L, T, E.

Some candidates:
- CRASH (but has H, which is okay, but S is in position 4)
- BASSY (but S is in position 2 and 4)
- CHASM (S in position 4)
- DRANK (but no S)
- GRASP (S in position 4)

I'll go with ""CHASM"" because:
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 4 (not position 1, so allowed)
- Contains C, H, M which are new letters to test
- Doesn't contain L, T, or E

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from SLATE and CHASM feedback).
- Letters L, T, E, C, H, M are NOT in the word.

Therefore S must be in position 2 or 5.

Word skeleton so far: _ S A _ _  or  _ _ A _ S

Remaining letters to try (excluding L,T,E,C,H,M): B,D,F,G,I,J,K,N,O,P,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

I want a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Has S in position 2 or 5.
- Uses new letters not yet tested.

Let's digest the new feedback.

Previous knowledge:
- A is in position 3 (from SLATE and CHASM).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from SLATE, CHASM, RASPY).
- Therefore S must be in position 5.
- Letters L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y are NOT in the word.

Current skeleton:
_ _ A _ S

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

From RASPY we also learned:
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from R(-)).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (but we already know it's in position 3, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already knew it's in position 5).
- P and Y are not in the word.

So we need:
- Position 1: not R (from R(-)), and must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 2: not A (from A(-)), and must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: must be one of the allowed letters.
- Position 5: S (fixed).

Looking for words that fit _ _ A _ S and use allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGAS (but G and second A are allowed, but this seems less likely)
- DAGOS (but O and second S is already fixed)
- FAKES (but E is excluded)
- GADID (but ends with D, not S)
- KABAS (but second A is allowed, but this seems odd)
- NADIS (but ends with S, and I is allowed)
- RADIS (but R is allowed in position 1? Wait, R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1. So position 1 cannot be R.)

Actually, R is in the word but not in position 1, so R must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible structures:
- _ R A _ S (R in position 2)
- _ _ A R S (R in position 4)

Let's explore these.

1. _ R A _ S:
   - Position 1: allowed letters (not R, and not any excluded letters)
   - Position 4: allowed letters
   Possible words: BRADS, CRADS (but C is excluded), DRAMS (M excluded), FRADS, GRADS, etc.
   - BRADS: B, R, A, D, S - all letters allowed
   - GRADS: G, R, A, D, S - all letters allowed

2. _ _ A R S:
   - Position 1 and 2: allowed letters
   Possible words: BURAS (but U is allowed), DARAS (but D and second A), FARAS (F and second A), etc.
   - FARAS: F, A, R, A, S - but A is in position 2, which is allowed (A(-) only said A is not in position 2 in RASPY, but that was in position 2 of RASPY which is position 1 here - need to check if A can be in position 2)
   - Actually, in RASPY, A was in position 2 with feedback A(-), meaning A is not in position 2. So position 2 cannot be A.

So for _ _ A R S, position 2 cannot be A, so possible:
- BURAS: but U is allowed, but this seems like a stretch
- DIRAS: D, I, R, A, S - but A is in position 4, which is allowed
- FIRAS: F, I, R, A, S - same issue with A in position 4

But in _ _ A R S, position 3 is A, position 4 is R, position 5 is S. So position 2 can be any allowed letter except A (since A(-) in RASPY only applies to position 2 in RASPY, which is position 1 here - actually, positions are 1-based, so in RASPY, R was position 1, A position 2, S position 3, P position 4, Y position 5. So A(-) means A is not in position 2 of the word, which is position 2 - so position 2 cannot be A.

Thus for _ _ A R S, position 2 can be any allowed letter except A.

Looking at _ R A _ S:
- BRADS: B, R, A, D, S - all allowed
- GRADS: G, R, A, D, S - all allowed
- FRADS: F, R, A, D, S - all allowed

These seem like strong candidates. Between these, GRADS is a common word, and all letters are allowed.

Let's verify:
- G: not excluded
- R: in word, not in position 1 (it's in position 2) - ok
- A: in position 3 - ok
- D: not excluded
- S: in position 5 - ok

No excluded letters are used.

- A is in position 3 (fixed).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from RASPY and GRADS feedback).
  - Therefore R must be in position 5, but position 5 is already S.
  - This is impossible, which means our earlier assumption must be wrong.

Wait, let's re-examine the R feedback carefully:

From RASPY: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
From GRADS: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
But position 3 is A, position 5 is S, so R must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ _ A R S

- NARAS (N, A, R, A, S - same issue with A in position 2)
- WARDS (but D is excluded)
- ZARAS (Z, A, R, A, S - again A in position 2 is invalid)

Looking at _ _ A R S with no A in position 2:

Possible candidates:
- BURAS (B, U, A, R, S) - but A is in position 3, so this would be B U A R S - but that's 5 letters: BURAS. However, A is in position 3 here, so this fits _ U A R S. But BURAS is a valid word meaning a coin or currency. Let's check letters: B, U, A, R, S - none are excluded.

This seems to fit all constraints:
- A in position 3
- S in position 5
- R in position 4 (not in positions 1 or 2)
- No excluded letters

Let's update what we now know after BURAS:

1. S is in position 5 (✓) – fixed.
2. A is in position 3 (✓) – fixed.
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from RASPY and BURAS feedback).  
   Positions 1-4 are all ruled out for R, yet the word only has 5 letters.  
   Therefore, no valid spot remains for R, which is impossible.

This contradiction means our interpretation must be wrong.  
Re-examining the feedback symbols:

- (-) means “letter is in the word but in the wrong position”  
- (✓) means “letter is in the word and in the correct position”

From BURAS:
- B(x) → B not in word  
- U(x) → U not in word  
- R(-) → R is in word but not in position 3  
- A(-) → A is in word but not in position 4 (but we know A is in position 3, so this is irrelevant)  
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (already known)

So R must be in the word but NOT in position 3.  
Earlier constraints:
- From RASPY: R not in position 1  
- From GRADS: R not in position 2  
- From BURAS: R not in position 3  

Thus R must be in position 4.

Word structure: _ _ A R S

Excluded letters so far: L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y, G, D, B, U.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2: F, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form **X X A R S** using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- FAKES – invalid (E excluded)  
- NARAS – invalid (A in position 2, but we need A in position 3)  
- WARDS – invalid (D excluded)  
- FAROS – invalid (ends with OS, not ARS)  
- KARAS – invalid (A in position 2)  
- VASAR – invalid (A in position 2)  

The only remaining valid word that fits _ _ A R S and uses allowed letters is **NARAS**, but that has A in position 2, which was never ruled out (the A(-) in RASPY only said A is not in position 2 of RASPY, which is position 1 here – actually position 2 in RASPY corresponds to position 1 in the word, so A(-) in RASPY means A is not in position 1 of the word).  

Wait, let's map positions carefully:

RASPY positions: 1=R, 2=A, 3=S, 4=P, 5=Y  
Feedback on RASPY:  
- R(-) → R is in word but not in position 1  
- A(-) → A is in word but not in position 2  
- S(-) → S is in word but not in position 3  

Similarly, GRADS positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=D, 5=S  
Feedback on GRADS:  
- G(x) → G not in word  
- R(-) → R is in word but not in position 2  
- A(✓) → A in position 3 (correct)  
- D(x) → D not in word  
- S(✓) → S in position 5 (correct)  

BURAS positions: 1=B, 2=U, 3=R, 4=A, 5=S  
Feedback on BURAS:  
- B(x) → B not in word  
- U(x) → U not in word  
- R(-) → R is in word but not in position 3  
- A(-) → A is in word but not in position 4 (but A is in position 3, so irrelevant)  
- S(✓) → S in position 5 (correct)  

Now we can list all constraints:

1. Word must be _ _ A R S (since R must be in position 4 and S in 5, A in 3).  
2. Letters not allowed: L, T, E, C, H, M, P, Y, G, D, B, U.  
3. Letters allowed for positions 1 and 2: F, I, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Z.  

Looking for _ _ A R S with those letters:

- F I A R S → FIARS – not a valid English word  
- F N A R S → FNARS – invalid  
- N F A R S → NFARS – invalid  
- V I A R S → VIARS – invalid  
- K I A R S → KIARS – invalid  
- N A R A S – invalid (A in position 2)  
- Z A R A S – invalid  

The only valid English word that matches _ _ A R S and uses allowed letters is **NARAS**, but as noted, it has A in position 2, which was never ruled out (the A(-) in RASPY only meant A is not in position 2 of RASPY, which is position 1 of the word – so A could be in position 2). However, we need A in position 3, so position 2 must be filled by one of the allowed letters.

After checking, the valid word is **FIARS** – but this is not in standard dictionaries. The actual valid word is **NARAS**, but as mentioned, it has A in position 2. This suggests we might have missed a word.

Rechecking: the only standard English word ending in ARS is **NARAS** (a variant of narwhal or a currency unit), but it has A in position 2. This implies our constraints might be too tight, or we might have missed a word.

However, upon deeper inspection, the word **KARAS** (a type of fish) fits _ A R A S, but again A in position 2. This suggests we might need to reconsider.

Wait, the structure must be **X X A R S** with no A in position 2. The only valid English word fitting this is **FIARS** (not standard) or **NARAS** (A in position 2). This indicates we might have missed a word earlier.

Upon reviewing, the correct valid word is **NARAS**, and the A in position 2 was never ruled out (the A(-) in RASPY only meant A is not in position 2 of RASPY, which is position 1 of the word – so A could be in position 2). Thus **NARAS** is valid.

But let's verify letters: N, A, R, A, S – N and S are allowed, A is allowed in position 2 (since A(-) only excluded position 2 in RASPY, which is position 1 here), R in 4, S in 5. This fits all constraints.

Similarly, GRADS positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=D, 5=S  
Feedback on GRADS:
