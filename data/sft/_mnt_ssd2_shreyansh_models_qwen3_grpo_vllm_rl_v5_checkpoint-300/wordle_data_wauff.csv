For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems like a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We now know the word has an A somewhere other than the first letter, and it uses none of R, O, S, E.  
Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the A (but moves it to a new spot).
2. Introduces fresh, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good letters still available: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, Y, etc.

A balanced choice: “TAINT”
- Uses A in position 2 (not 1).
- Introduces T, I, N (all still possible).
- Has two Ts and an I, giving extra coverage.

But “TAINT” repeats T, which isn’t ideal. A better choice is “TAINT” or “PLANT” – but “PLANT” uses P and L, which are fine.

Actually, let’s go with “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (safe, since A can’t be in position 1).

Wait – but “PLANT” has A in position 2, which is allowed.

But let me double-check: A is in the word but not in position 1, so position 2, 3, 4, or 5 is fine.

“PLANT” has A in position 2 – that’s acceptable.

So my next guess is “PLANT”.

- The word does **not** contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.

A good candidate is “CHAIM” (a name, but sometimes accepted in word lists), but that uses M and I, and A is in position 3 – which is disallowed.

Another candidate: “CABIN” – but N is already ruled out.

How about “BASIC”? Uses B, I, C, and A in position 2. All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check:
- B – not ruled out.
- A – allowed, in position 2.
- S – ruled out (from AROSE), so “BASIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FAIRY” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “GAMMA” – but A is in position 3 (disallowed).

Next: “DAILY” – but L is ruled out.

Next: “VACAY” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2, C is allowed, but “VACAY” is a bit obscure.

“PLANT” has A in position 2 – that’s acceptable.

So my next guess is “PLANT”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are **not** in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does **not** contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.

A good candidate is “CHAIM” (a name, but sometimes accepted in word lists), but that uses M and I, and A is in position 3 – which is disallowed.

Another candidate: “CABIN” – but N is already ruled out.

How about “BASIC”? Uses B, I, C, and A in position 2. All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check:
- B – not ruled out.
- A – allowed, in position 2.
- S – ruled out (from AROSE), so “BASIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FAIRY” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “GAMMA” – but A is in position 3 (disallowed).

Next: “DAILY” – but L is ruled out.

Next: “VACAY” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2, C is allowed, but “VACAY” is a bit obscure.

Another candidate: “CADDY” – but no A.

Next: “CABER” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” – N ruled out.

Next: “CABAL” – L ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” already ruled out.

Next: “CABBY” – B allowed, A in position 2, Y allowed.

“CABBY” seems valid:
- C, B, B, Y are all still allowed.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

So I’ll go with “CABBY” as the next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. CABBY → C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   - C, B, Y are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct there.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y
- The word must contain A in position 2.
- Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those ruled out.
- Has A in position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of common words fitting _ A _ _ _ with these constraints:
- D: DAILY (but L is out), DAMP (but P is out), DARK (R is out)
- F: FANCY (C, Y out), FARCE (C, E out)
- G: GAMMA (M allowed, but A is in position 2, so G A M M A - but M is allowed, but we have two M's which might be okay), but GAMMA has A in position 2 and uses G, M, A, but we have Y out, so GAMMA is invalid because Y is out (but GAMMA doesn't have Y, it has M). Wait, GAMMA is G A M M A - letters are G, A, M, M, A. All letters are allowed (G, M not ruled out yet). But we have to check if any of these letters are ruled out. From feedback, G hasn't been used yet, M hasn't been used yet. So GAMMA is possible, but is it a common word? Maybe.

But let's think of more common words:
- H: HAPPY (P, Y out)
- I: IRATE (R, E out)
- K: KAYAK (Y out)
- M: MADAM (D, M allowed), but MADAM has D and M which are allowed. Let's check: M A D A M. But A is already in position 2, and we have another A in position 4. Is that allowed? The secret word could have multiple As, but we don't have info against it. However, our feedback only confirmed one A in position 2. But the word could have more As. So MADAM is possible, but let's see if we can find a better one.

Another option: MAVEN (V, N - N is out)
MAIZE (Z not considered)
MACAW (C, W - C is out)
MAJOR (J not considered, R out)
MANIA (N out)
MAGMA (G, M allowed - G A M A, but we need 5 letters)
MAHOG (G allowed, but O is out)
MAHON (N out)
MAHOT (T out)
MAHOG is invalid because O is out.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ A _ _ _, and letters not used yet include D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of words like:
- D A I L Y - but L, Y out
- F A I R Y - R, Y out
- G A M E S - E, S out
- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word? Maybe not common
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D G O - O out
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D G Y - Y out
- M A D H O - O out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D I K - K allowed, but is M A D I K a word? Doesn't seem common
- M A D I C - C out
- M A D I S - S out
- M A D I N - N out
- M A D I T - T out
- M A D I U - U allowed, but M A D I U isn't a word
- M A D I V - V allowed, but M A D I V isn't a word
- M A D I W - W allowed, but M A D I W isn't a word
- M A D I K - same issue
- M A D I E - same
- M A D I G - G allowed, but M A D I G isn't a word
- M A D I F - F allowed, but M A D I F isn't a word
- M A D I H - H allowed, but M A D I H isn't a word

Hmm, seems like _ A _ _ _ with these constraints is tricky. Let me try:
- D A M P E - P, E out
- D A M S E - S, E out
- D A M S T - T out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A M P Y - P, Y out
- D A M B E - B out
- D A M C E - C out
- D A M F E - E out
- D A M G E - E out
- D A M H E - E out
- D A M I E - E out
- D A M I D - D allowed, but D A M I D isn't a word
- D A M I K - K allowed, but D A M I K isn't a word
- D A M I L - L out
- D A M I M - M allowed, but D A M I M isn't a word
- D A M I N - N out
- D A M I P - P out
- D A M I R - R out
- D A M I S - S out
- D A M I T - T out
- D A M I V - V allowed, but D A M I V isn't a word
- D A M I W - W allowed, but D A M I W isn't a word
- D A M I Y - Y out

This seems difficult. Maybe I should consider that the word might not have any other A besides the one in position 2. So the pattern is _ A _ _ _, and the remaining letters are from the allowed set.

Let me think of common words:
- D A I S Y - S, Y out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A N K S - N, S out
- D A R K S - R, S out
- D A R K O - R, O out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out
- D A R K H - R out
- D A R K M - R out
- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K Z - R, Z out
- D A R K F - R out
- D A R K G - R out
- D A R K I - R out
- D A R K J - R out
- D A R K K - R out

- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K X - R out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out
- D A R K Z - R, Z out

None of these work. Let me try starting with F:
- F A I R Y - R, Y out
- F A I R Y - same
- F A I R Y - same
- F A I R Y - same

G:
- G A M E S - E, S out
- G A M E D - E out
- G A M E R - R out
- G A M E T - T out
- G A M E Y - Y out
- G A M E Z - Z out

- G A M E I - I allowed, but G A M E I isn't a word
- G A M E J - J out
- G A M E K - K allowed, but G A M E K isn't a word
- G A M E L - L out
- G A M E M - M allowed, but G A M E M isn't a word

- G A M E W - W allowed, but G A M E W isn't a word
- G A M E X - X out
- G A M E Y - Y out
- G A M E Z - Z out

H:
- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word? It's a type of poetry, but might not be accepted here
- H A I L S - L, S out
- H A I L Y - L, Y out
- H A I K U - seems the closest

I:
- I A M O N - O, N out
- I A M U S - S out
- I A M V E - E out
- I A M W E - E out

K:
- K A I S E - E out

M:

- M A I D U - U allowed, but M A I D U isn't a word
- M A I D Y - D, Y - Y out

- M A I D W - W allowed, but M A I D W isn't a word
- M A I D X - X out

- M A I D Z - Z out

U:

- U A I V E - V, E out

V:
- V A I V E - E out
- V A I V Y - Y out

W:
- W A I V E - E out
- W A I V Y - Y out

It seems extremely limited. The only plausible word I can think of is ""HAIKU"", even though it's a type of poetry. Let me check if ""HAIKU"" is accepted as a 5-letter word - yes, it is.

So, the word must be _ A _ _ _, contain A in position 2, and use only letters not ruled out. ""HAIKU"" fits:
- H: not ruled out
- A: in position 2 and confirmed correct
- I: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out
- U: not ruled out

Thus, ""HAIKU"" is the logical next guess.

From the feedback we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is locked in position 2).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y.
- Allowed letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

The only common 5-letter word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses only still-allowed letters is “HAIKU”.

It seems extremely limited. The only plausible word I can think of is ""HAIKU"", even though it's a type of poetry. Let me check if ""HAIKU"" is accepted as a 5-letter word - yes, it is.

So, the word must be _ A _ _ _, contain A in position 2, and use only letters not ruled out. ""HAIKU"" fits:
- H: not ruled out
- A: in position 2 and confirmed correct
- I: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out
- U: not ruled out

Thus, ""HAIKU"" is the logical next guess.From the feedback we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is locked in position 2).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y.
- Allowed letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems like a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We now know the word has an A somewhere other than the first letter, and it uses none of R, O, S, E.  
Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the A (but moves it to a new spot).
2. Introduces fresh, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good letters still available: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, Y, etc.

A balanced choice: “TAINT”
- Uses A in position 2 (not 1).
- Introduces T, I, N (all still possible).
- Has two Ts and an I, giving extra coverage.

But “TAINT” repeats T, which isn’t ideal. A better choice is “TAINT” or “PLANT” – but “PLANT” uses P and L, which are fine.

Actually, let’s go with “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (safe, since A can’t be in position 1).

Wait – but “PLANT” has A in position 2, which is allowed.

But let me double-check: A is in the word but not in position 1, so position 2, 3, 4, or 5 is fine.

“PLANT” has A in position 2 – that’s acceptable.

So my next guess is “PLANT”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are **not** in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does **not** contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.

A good candidate is “CHAIM” (a name, but sometimes accepted in word lists), but that uses M and I, and A is in position 3 – which is disallowed.

Another candidate: “CABIN” – but N is already ruled out.

How about “BASIC”? Uses B, I, C, and A in position 2. All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check:
- B – not ruled out.
- A – allowed, in position 2.
- S – ruled out (from AROSE), so “BASIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FAIRY” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “GAMMA” – but A is in position 3 (disallowed).

Next: “DAILY” – but L is ruled out.

Next: “VACAY” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2, C is allowed, but “VACAY” is a bit obscure.

Another candidate: “CADDY” – but no A.

Next: “CABER” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” – N ruled out.

Next: “CABAL” – L ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” already ruled out.

Next: “CABBY” – B allowed, A in position 2, Y allowed.

“CABBY” seems valid:
- C, B, B, Y are all still allowed.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

So I’ll go with “CABBY” as the next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: CABBY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. CABBY → C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   - C, B, Y are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct there.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y
- The word must contain A in position 2.
- Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those ruled out.
- Has A in position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of common words fitting _ A _ _ _ with these constraints:
- D: DAILY (but L is out), DAMP (but P is out), DARK (R is out)
- F: FANCY (C, Y out), FARCE (C, E out)
- G: GAMMA (M allowed, but A is in position 2, so G A M M A - but M is allowed, but we have two M's which might be okay), but GAMMA has A in position 2 and uses G, M, A, but we have Y out, so GAMMA is invalid because Y is out (but GAMMA doesn't have Y, it has M). Wait, GAMMA is G A M M A - letters are G, A, M, M, A. All letters are allowed (G, M not ruled out yet). But we have to check if any of these letters are ruled out. From feedback, G hasn't been used yet, M hasn't been used yet. So GAMMA is possible, but is it a common word? Maybe.

But let's think of more common words:
- H: HAPPY (P, Y out)
- I: IRATE (R, E out)
- K: KAYAK (Y out)
- M: MADAM (D, M allowed), but MADAM has D and M which are allowed. Let's check: M A D A M. But A is already in position 2, and we have another A in position 4. Is that allowed? The secret word could have multiple As, but we don't have info against it. However, our feedback only confirmed one A in position 2. But the word could have more As. So MADAM is possible, but let's see if we can find a better one.

Another option: MAVEN (V, N - N is out)
MAIZE (Z not considered)
MACAW (C, W - C is out)
MAJOR (J not considered, R out)
MANIA (N out)
MAGMA (G, M allowed - G A M A, but we need 5 letters)
MAHOG (G allowed, but O is out)
MAHON (N out)
MAHOT (T out)
MAHOG is invalid because O is out.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ A _ _ _, and letters not used yet include D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of words like:
- D A I L Y - but L, Y out
- F A I R Y - R, Y out
- G A M E S - E, S out
- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word? Maybe not common
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D G O - O out
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D G Y - Y out
- M A D H O - O out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D I K - K allowed, but is M A D I K a word? Doesn't seem common
- M A D I C - C out
- M A D I S - S out
- M A D I N - N out
- M A D I T - T out
- M A D I U - U allowed, but M A D I U isn't a word
- M A D I V - V allowed, but M A D I V isn't a word
- M A D I W - W allowed, but M A D I W isn't a word
- M A D I K - same issue
- M A D I E - same
- M A D I G - G allowed, but M A D I G isn't a word
- M A D I F - F allowed, but M A D I F isn't a word
- M A D I H - H allowed, but M A D I H isn't a word

Hmm, seems like _ A _ _ _ with these constraints is tricky. Let me try:
- D A M P E - P, E out
- D A M S E - S, E out
- D A M S T - T out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A M P Y - P, Y out
- D A M B E - B out
- D A M C E - C out
- D A M F E - E out
- D A M G E - E out
- D A M H E - E out
- D A M I E - E out
- D A M I D - D allowed, but D A M I D isn't a word
- D A M I K - K allowed, but D A M I K isn't a word
- D A M I L - L out
- D A M I M - M allowed, but D A M I M isn't a word
- D A M I N - N out
- D A M I P - P out
- D A M I R - R out
- D A M I S - S out
- D A M I T - T out
- D A M I V - V allowed, but D A M I V isn't a word
- D A M I W - W allowed, but D A M I W isn't a word
- D A M I Y - Y out

This seems difficult. Maybe I should consider that the word might not have any other A besides the one in position 2. So the pattern is _ A _ _ _, and the remaining letters are from the allowed set.

Let me think of common words:
- D A I S Y - S, Y out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A N K S - N, S out
- D A R K S - R, S out
- D A R K O - R, O out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out
- D A R K H - R out
- D A R K M - R out
- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K Z - R, Z out
- D A R K F - R out
- D A R K G - R out
- D A R K I - R out
- D A R K J - R out
- D A R K K - R out
- D A R K L - R, L out
- D A R K M - R out
- D A R K N - R, N out
- D A R K P - R, P out
- D A R K Q - R out
- D A R K S - R, S out

- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K X - R out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out

However, our feedback only confirmed one A in position 2. But the word could have more As. So MADAM is possible, but let\'s see if we can find a better one.\n\nAnother option: MAVEN (V, N - N is out)\nMAIZE (Z not considered)\nMACAW (C, W - C is out)\nMAJOR (J not considered, R out)\nMANIA (N out)\nMAGMA (G, M allowed - G A M A, but we need 5 letters)\nMAHOG (G allowed, but O is out)\nMAHON (N out)\nMAHOT (T out)\nMAHOG is invalid because O is out.\n\nWait, let\'s think differently.

   – H, I, K are not in the word.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 5: not U
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y, H, I, K
- Allowed letters for other positions: D, F, G, M, V, W, Q, X, Z, J (but Q, X, Z, J are unlikely)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ _, using only the allowed letters, and with the fifth letter ≠ U.

This is extremely restrictive. The only remaining common word I can think of is “MADAM”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E

""AROSE"" seems like a strong choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : the letter A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) : S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) : E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We now know the word has an A somewhere other than the first letter, and it uses none of R, O, S, E.  
Next, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Keeps the A (but moves it to a new spot).
2. Introduces fresh, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Good letters still available: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, Y, etc.

A balanced choice: “TAINT”
- Uses A in position 2 (not 1).
- Introduces T, I, N (all still possible).
- Has two Ts and an I, giving extra coverage.

But “TAINT” repeats T, which isn’t ideal. A better choice is “TAINT” or “PLANT” – but “PLANT” uses P and L, which are fine.

Actually, let’s go with “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (safe, since A can’t be in position 1).

Wait – but “PLANT” has A in position 2, which is allowed.

But let me double-check: A is in the word but not in position 1, so position 2, 3, 4, or 5 is fine.

“PLANT” has A in position 2 – that’s acceptable.

So my next guess is “PLANT”.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are **not** in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are **not** in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does **not** contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (and A must be in positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters from the “still possible” set.

A good candidate is “CHAIM” (a name, but sometimes accepted in word lists), but that uses M and I, and A is in position 3 – which is disallowed.

Another candidate: “CABIN” – but N is already ruled out.

How about “BASIC”? Uses B, I, C, and A in position 2. All letters are still allowed.

Let’s check:
- B – not ruled out.
- A – allowed, in position 2.
- S – ruled out (from AROSE), so “BASIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FAIRY” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “GAMMA” – but A is in position 3 (disallowed).

Next: “DAILY” – but L is ruled out.

Next: “VACAY” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2, C is allowed, but “VACAY” is a bit obscure.

Another candidate: “CADDY” – but no A.

Next: “CABER” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” – N ruled out.

Next: “CABAL” – L ruled out.

Next: “CABIN” already ruled out.

Next: “CABBY” – B allowed, A in position 2, Y allowed.

“CABBY” seems valid:
- C, B, B, Y are all still allowed.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

So I’ll go with “CABBY” as the next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: CABBY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. CABBY → C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   - C, B, Y are not in the word.
   - A is in position 2 and is correct there.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y
- The word must contain A in position 2.
- Remaining letters to consider: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those ruled out.
- Has A in position 2.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4, 5: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of common words fitting _ A _ _ _ with these constraints:
- D: DAILY (but L is out), DAMP (but P is out), DARK (R is out)
- F: FANCY (C, Y out), FARCE (C, E out)
- G: GAMMA (M allowed, but A is in position 2, so G A M M A - but M is allowed, but we have two M's which might be okay), but GAMMA has A in position 2 and uses G, M, A, but we have Y out, so GAMMA is invalid because Y is out (but GAMMA doesn't have Y, it has M). Wait, GAMMA is G A M M A - letters are G, A, M, M, A. All letters are allowed (G, M not ruled out yet). But we have to check if any of these letters are ruled out. From feedback, G hasn't been used yet, M hasn't been used yet. So GAMMA is possible, but is it a common word? Maybe.

But let's think of more common words:
- H: HAPPY (P, Y out)
- I: IRATE (R, E out)
- K: KAYAK (Y out)
- M: MADAM (D, M allowed), but MADAM has D and M which are allowed. Let's check: M A D A M. But A is already in position 2, and we have another A in position 4. Is that allowed? The secret word could have multiple As, but we don't have info against it. However, our feedback only confirmed one A in position 2. But the word could have more As. So MADAM is possible, but let's see if we can find a better one.

Another option: MAVEN (V, N - N is out)
MAIZE (Z not considered)
MACAW (C, W - C is out)
MAJOR (J not considered, R out)
MANIA (N out)
MAGMA (G, M allowed - G A M A, but we need 5 letters)
MAHOG (G allowed, but O is out)
MAHON (N out)
MAHOT (T out)
MAHOG is invalid because O is out.

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be _ A _ _ _, and letters not used yet include D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

Let's think of words like:
- D A I L Y - but L, Y out
- F A I R Y - R, Y out
- G A M E S - E, S out
- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word? Maybe not common
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D G O - O out
- M A D G E - E out
- M A D G Y - Y out
- M A D H O - O out
- M A D I E - E out
- M A D I K - K allowed, but is M A D I K a word? Doesn't seem common
- M A D I C - C out
- M A D I S - S out
- M A D I N - N out
- M A D I T - T out
- M A D I U - U allowed, but M A D I U isn't a word
- M A D I V - V allowed, but M A D I V isn't a word
- M A D I W - W allowed, but M A D I W isn't a word
- M A D I K - same issue
- M A D I E - same
- M A D I G - G allowed, but M A D I G isn't a word
- M A D I F - F allowed, but M A D I F isn't a word
- M A D I H - H allowed, but M A D I H isn't a word

Hmm, seems like _ A _ _ _ with these constraints is tricky. Let me try:
- D A M P E - P, E out
- D A M S E - S, E out
- D A M S T - T out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A M P Y - P, Y out
- D A M B E - B out
- D A M C E - C out
- D A M F E - E out
- D A M G E - E out
- D A M H E - E out
- D A M I E - E out
- D A M I D - D allowed, but D A M I D isn't a word
- D A M I K - K allowed, but D A M I K isn't a word
- D A M I L - L out
- D A M I M - M allowed, but D A M I M isn't a word
- D A M I N - N out
- D A M I P - P out
- D A M I R - R out
- D A M I S - S out
- D A M I T - T out
- D A M I V - V allowed, but D A M I V isn't a word
- D A M I W - W allowed, but D A M I W isn't a word
- D A M I Y - Y out

This seems difficult. Maybe I should consider that the word might not have any other A besides the one in position 2. So the pattern is _ A _ _ _, and the remaining letters are from the allowed set.

Let me think of common words:
- D A I S Y - S, Y out
- D A M P S - P, S out
- D A N K S - N, S out
- D A R K S - R, S out
- D A R K O - R, O out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out
- D A R K H - R out
- D A R K M - R out
- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K Z - R, Z out
- D A R K F - R out
- D A R K G - R out
- D A R K I - R out
- D A R K J - R out
- D A R K K - R out
- D A R K L - R, L out
- D A R K M - R out
- D A R K N - R, N out
- D A R K P - R, P out
- D A R K Q - R out
- D A R K S - R, S out
- D A R K T - R, T out
- D A R K U - R out
- D A R K V - R out
- D A R K W - R out
- D A R K X - R out
- D A R K Y - R, Y out
- D A R K Z - R, Z out

None of these work. Let me try starting with F:
- F A I R Y - R, Y out
- F A I R Y - same
- F A I R Y - same
- F A I R Y - same

G:
- G A M E S - E, S out
- G A M E D - E out
- G A M E R - R out
- G A M E T - T out
- G A M E Y - Y out
- G A M E Z - Z out
- G A M E H - H allowed, but G A M E H isn't a word
- G A M E I - I allowed, but G A M E I isn't a word
- G A M E J - J out
- G A M E K - K allowed, but G A M E K isn't a word
- G A M E L - L out
- G A M E M - M allowed, but G A M E M isn't a word
- G A M E N - N out
- G A M E P - P out
- G A M E Q - Q out
- G A M E R - R out
- G A M E S - S out
- G A M E T - T out
- G A M E U - U allowed, but G A M E U isn't a word
- G A M E V - V allowed, but G A M E V isn't a word
- G A M E W - W allowed, but G A M E W isn't a word
- G A M E X - X out
- G A M E Y - Y out
- G A M E Z - Z out

H:
- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word? It's a type of poetry, but might not be accepted here
- H A I L S - L, S out
- H A I L Y - L, Y out
- H A I K U - seems the closest

I:
- I A M O N - O, N out
- I A M U S - S out
- I A M V E - E out
- I A M W E - E out

K:
- K A I S E - E out
- K A I S T - T out
- K A I S U - S, U out
- K A I S Y - S, Y out

M:
- M A I Z E - Z out
- M A I D E - E out
- M A I D O - O out
- M A I D U - U allowed, but M A I D U isn't a word
- M A I D Y - D, Y - Y out
- M A I D S - S out
- M A I D T - T out
- M A I D H - H allowed, but M A I D H isn't a word
- M A I D K - K allowed, but M A I D K isn't a word
- M A I D L - L out
- M A I D N - N out
- M A I D P - P out
- M A I D R - R out
- M A I D S - S out
- M A I D V - V allowed, but M A I D V isn't a word
- M A I D W - W allowed, but M A I D W isn't a word
- M A I D X - X out
- M A I D Y - Y out
- M A I D Z - Z out

U:
- U A I O U - O out
- U A I U S - S out
- U A I V E - V, E out

V:
- V A I V E - E out
- V A I V Y - Y out

W:
- W A I V E - E out
- W A I V Y - Y out

It seems extremely limited. The only plausible word I can think of is ""HAIKU"", even though it's a type of poetry. Let me check if ""HAIKU"" is accepted as a 5-letter word - yes, it is.

So, the word must be _ A _ _ _, contain A in position 2, and use only letters not ruled out. ""HAIKU"" fits:
- H: not ruled out
- A: in position 2 and confirmed correct
- I: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out
- U: not ruled out

Thus, ""HAIKU"" is the logical next guess.From the feedback we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is locked in position 2).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y.
- Allowed letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.

The only common 5-letter word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses only still-allowed letters is “HAIKU”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: CABBY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: HAIKU -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   – A is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. CABBY → C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   – C, B, Y are not in the word.
   – A is correctly placed in position 2.

4. HAIKU → H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(-)
   – H, I, K are not in the word.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – U is in the word but not in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 5: not U
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y, H, I, K
- Allowed letters for other positions: D, F, G, M, V, W, Q, X, Z, J (but Q, X, Z, J are unlikely)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ _, using only the allowed letters, and with the fifth letter ≠ U.

Looking at common words:
- D A M P S – P, S forbidden
- D A M S T – T forbidden
- D A M P Y – Y forbidden
- D A M S E – E forbidden
- D A M S O – O forbidden
- D A M S I – I forbidden
- D A M S K – K forbidden
- D A M S H – H forbidden
- D A M S G – G allowed, but DAMSG isn’t a word
- D A M S V – V allowed, but DAMSV isn’t a word
- D A M S W – W allowed, but DAMSW isn’t a word

The only plausible remaining word seems to be “DAMPS” but P is forbidden. Next, let’s try starting with M:
- M A D G E – E forbidden
- M A D G Y – Y forbidden
- M A D G O – O forbidden
- M A D G U – U not allowed in position 5
- M A D G I – I forbidden
- M A D G K – K forbidden
- M A D G H – H forbidden
- M A D G S – S forbidden
- M A D G T – T forbidden
- M A D G V – V allowed, but MADGV isn’t a word
- M A D G W – W allowed, but MADGW isn’t a word

This is extremely restrictive. The only remaining common word I can think of is “MADAM”:
- M A D A M
  – A is allowed in positions 2 and 4
  – D is allowed
  – M is allowed
  – It’s a valid 5-letter word

Let me verify:
- M: not forbidden
- A: allowed in position 2 (already confirmed)
- D: not forbidden
- A: allowed in position 4 (no restriction on A in position 4)
- M: not forbidden
- No forbidden letters used

Therefore, “MADAM” is the logical next guess.

Let me try:\n- D A M P E - P, E out\n- D A M S E - S, E out\n- D A M S T - T out\n- D A M P S - P, S out\n- D A M P Y - P, Y out\n- D A M B E - B out\n- D A M C E - C out\n- D A M F E - E out\n- D A M G E - E out\n- D A M H E - E out\n- D A M I E - E out\n- D A M I D - D allowed, but D A M I D isn\'t a word\n- D A M I K - K allowed, but D A M I K isn\'t a word\n- D A M I L - L out\n- D A M I M - M allowed, but D A M I M isn\'t a word\n- D A M I N - N out\n- D A M I P - P out\n- D A M I R - R out\n- D A M I S - S out\n- D A M I T - T out\n- D A M I V - V allowed, but D A M I V isn\'t a word\n- D A M I W - W allowed, but D A M I W isn\'t a word\n- D A M I Y - Y out\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe I should consider that the word might not have any other A besides the one in position 2. So the pattern is _ A _ _ _, and the remaining letters are from the allowed set.\n\nLet me think of common words:\n- D A I S Y - S, Y out\n- D A M P S - P, S out\n- D A N K S - N, S out\n- D A R K S - R, S out\n- D A R K O - R, O out\n- D A R K Y - R, Y out\n- D A R K H - R out\n- D A R K M - R out\n- D A R K V - R out\n- D A R K W - R out\n- D A R K Z - R, Z out\n- D A R K F - R out\n- D A R K G - R out\n- D A R K I - R out\n- D A R K J - R out\n- D A R K K - R out\n- D A R K L - R, L out\n- D A R K M - R out\n- D A R K N - R, N out\n- D A R K P - R, P out\n- D A R K Q - R out\n- D A R K S - R, S out\n- D A R K T - R, T out\n- D A R K U - R out\n- D A R K V - R out\n- D A R K W - R out\n- D A R K X - R out\n- D A R K Y - R, Y out\n- D A R K Z - R, Z out\n\nNone of these work. Let me try starting with F:\n- F A I R Y - R, Y out\n- F A I R Y - same\n- F A I R Y - same\n- F A I R Y - same\n\nG:\n- G A M E S - E, S out\n- G A M E D - E out\n- G A M E R - R out\n- G A M E T - T out\n- G A M E Y - Y out\n- G A M E Z - Z out\n- G A M E H - H allowed, but G A M E H isn\'t a word\n- G A M E I - I allowed, but G A M E I isn\'t a word\n- G A M E J - J out\n- G A M E K - K allowed, but G A M E K isn\'t a word\n- G A M E L - L out\n- G A M E M - M allowed, but G A M E M isn\'t a word\n- G A M E N - N out\n- G A M E P - P out\n- G A M E Q - Q out\n- G A M E R - R out\n- G A M E S - S out\n- G A M E T - T out\n- G A M E U - U allowed, but G A M E U isn\'t a word\n- G A M E V - V allowed, but G A M E V isn\'t a word\n- G A M E W - W allowed, but G A M E W isn\'t a word\n- G A M E X - X out\n- G A M E Y - Y out\n- G A M E Z - Z out\n\nH:\n- H A I K U - K, U allowed, but is HAiku a word?

The only plausible word I can think of is ""HAIKU"", even though it\'s a type of poetry. Let me check if ""HAIKU"" is accepted as a 5-letter word - yes, it is.\n\nSo, the word must be _ A _ _ _, contain A in position 2, and use only letters not ruled out. ""HAIKU"" fits:\n- H: not ruled out\n- A: in position 2 and confirmed correct\n- I: not ruled out\n- K: not ruled out\n- U: not ruled out\n\nThus, ""HAIKU"" is the logical next guess.From the feedback we now know:\n- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is locked in position 2).\n- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y.\n- Allowed letters still available: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, etc.\n\nThe only common 5-letter word that fits _ A _ _ _ and uses only still-allowed letters is “HAIKU”.\n\n<guess>HAIKU</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: CABBY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: HAIKU -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From all feedback so far we have:\n\n1.

Next, let’s try starting with M:\n- M A D G E – E forbidden\n- M A D G Y – Y forbidden\n- M A D G O – O forbidden\n- M A D G U – U not allowed in position 5\n- M A D G I – I forbidden\n- M A D G K – K forbidden\n- M A D G H – H forbidden\n- M A D G S – S forbidden\n- M A D G T – T forbidden\n- M A D G V – V allowed, but MADGV isn’t a word\n- M A D G W – W allowed, but MADGW isn’t a word\n\nThis is extremely restrictive.

From all feedback so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, L, N, T are not in the word.
   – A is in the word, but not in position 3.

3. CABBY → C(x) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(x)
   – C, B, Y are not in the word.
   – A is correctly placed in position 2.

4. HAIKU → H(x) A(✓) I(x) K(x) U(-)
   – H, I, K are not in the word.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – U is in the word but not in position 5.

5. MADAM → M(x) A(✓) D(x) A(-) M(x)
   – M, D are not in the word.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – The second A is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2: A (fixed)
- Position 5: not U
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, C, B, Y, H, I, K, M, D
- Allowed letters for other positions: F, G, V, W, Q, X, Z, J (but Q, X, Z, J are unlikely)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A _ _ _, using only the allowed letters, and with the fifth letter ≠ U.
