For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Let's synthesize the feedback so far.

From AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in position 5.

From MONEY:
- M, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

These two facts seem contradictory: E cannot be both in position 5 and not in position 5. The only possible resolution is that the feedback for MONEY's E is indicating that E is in the word but not in position 5, which overrides the previous feedback that E is in position 5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- O is in position 2.
- A, R, S, M, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- O in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 5.
- No A, R, S, M, N, Y.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E somewhere (positions 1,3,4). Let's think of possibilities:
- Position 2 is O.
- E could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- E in position 1: EO??? (but E is not in position 5, so this is possible)
- E in position 3: ?O E ??
- E in position 4: ??O E ?

Let's think of words:
- EPOCH: E(1), O(2), C(3), H(4), none of the excluded letters. But E is in position 1, which is allowed.
- OPINE: but N is excluded.
- OPTED: D is allowed, but T and D are allowed.
- OPIUM: but U is allowed, but M is excluded.
- ELOPE: E in position 1 and 4, but L is allowed, P is allowed, but we have E in position 4 which is allowed.

But we need to check if these fit all constraints.

Let's try EPOCH:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is not restricted to position 5)
- O in position 2 (matches ✓)
- C, H are new letters
- No excluded letters (A,R,S,M,N,Y are absent)

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be OPTED:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- P, T, D are new letters
- No excluded letters

But EPOCH seems more straightforward with E in position 1.

However, we need to make sure E is in the word but not in position 5, and O is in position 2. Both EPOCH and OPTED fit.

Between these, EPOCH uses C and H which are common letters and haven't been tested yet.

I'll go with EPOCH.

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:

- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and common consonants

Another candidate is “DOUSE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- Uses D, U, S – but S is ruled out.

Another candidate is “MONEY”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- Uses M, N, Y – all new letters.

Let’s go with MONEY.

Here is some previous feedback:

Let's synthesize the feedback so far.

From AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in position 5.

From MONEY:
- M, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

These two facts seem contradictory: E cannot be both in position 5 and not in position 5. The only possible resolution is that the feedback for MONEY's E is indicating that E is in the word but not in position 5, which overrides the previous feedback that E is in position 5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- O is in position 2.
- A, R, S, M, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- O in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 5.
- No A, R, S, M, N, Y.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E somewhere (positions 1,3,4). Let's think of possibilities:
- Position 2 is O.
- E could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- E in position 1: EO??? (but E is not in position 5, so this is possible)
- E in position 3: ?O E ??
- E in position 4: ??O E ?

Let's think of words:
- EPOCH: E(1), O(2), C(3), H(4), none of the excluded letters. But E is in position 1, which is allowed.
- OPINE: but N is excluded.
- OPTED: D is allowed, but T and D are allowed.
- OPIUM: but U is allowed, but M is excluded.
- ELOPE: E in position 1 and 4, but L is allowed, P is allowed, but we have E in position 4 which is allowed.

But we need to check if these fit all constraints.

Let's try EPOCH:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is not restricted to position 5)
- O in position 2 (matches ✓)
- C, H are new letters
- No excluded letters (A,R,S,M,N,Y are absent)

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be OPTED:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- P, T, D are new letters
- No excluded letters

But EPOCH seems more straightforward with E in position 1.

However, we need to make sure E is in the word but not in position 5, and O is in position 2. Both EPOCH and OPTED fit.

Between these, EPOCH uses C and H which are common letters and haven't been tested yet.

I'll go with EPOCH.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Letters A, R, S, M, N, Y are excluded.

A word that fits these constraints is EPOCH, with O in position 2 and E in position 1.

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
→ A, R, S are out.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
→ E is in position 5.

Guess 2: MONEY  
M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
→ M, N, Y are out.  
→ O is in position 2.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Guess 3: EPOCH  
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)  
→ P, C, H are out.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known) and also NOT in position 2 (because Guess 2 said O is in position 2).  

Wait, that last point is critical: Guess 3 shows O(-) (in the word but wrong place) while position 2 of EPOCH is O. But Guess 2 already pinned O to position 2. The only way both can be true is if the feedback for EPOCH’s O is a mistake in my interpretation. Actually, the feedback for EPOCH is:
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
This means:
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- P, C, H are out.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).

Guess 2 already gave us O(✓) in position 2, so the O in EPOCH must be in position 3 (since position 2 is already taken by O). But the feedback says O(-) for position 3, which contradicts Guess 2. This suggests I misread Guess 2's O feedback.

Rechecking Guess 2: MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
This means:
- M, N, Y are out.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, in EPOCH, the O at position 3 must be the one that is ""in the word but wrong place"", confirming O is indeed in position 2 (from MONEY) and not in position 3.

So current constraints:
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from EPOCH and MONEY).
- Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, P, C, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 3 or 4.
- No excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O E _ _
- _ O _ E _

Let's brainstorm:
- DOGUE: but G and U are allowed, but word isn't valid.
- BOGIE: but I is allowed, B and G are allowed, but word is valid.
- FOYER: but Y is excluded.
- GOUGE: but G, U, E are allowed, but word is valid.
- LOEWE: but W is allowed, but double E and word is valid.
- TOEIC: but C is excluded.
- VOUGE: but G is allowed, but word isn't valid.

Looking for valid words:
- BOGIE: B O G I E → E is in position 5, but E cannot be in 5 (from MONEY). Invalid.
- GOUGE: G O U G E → E in 5, invalid.
- LOEWE: L O E W → not 5 letters, invalid.
- TOGAE: not a word.
- DOGIE: D O G I E → E in 5, invalid.

Wait, let's think differently: E must be in 3 or 4, and position 5 is not E.

So:
- _ O E _ _ : last letter not E.
- _ O _ E _ : fourth letter not E.

Valid words:
- DOGGE: not valid.
- BOGUS: S is excluded.
- FOGEY: Y is excluded.
- GOLEM: M is excluded.
- LOEWE: not valid.
- TOGAE: not valid.

Hmm, let's try:
- B O D E _ : but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- B O D E _ : need a valid word. BODE_... BODE is prefix, but not a word.
- B O X E _: X is allowed, but no valid word.
- L O B E _: Lobe is a word, but 4 letters.
- T O B E _: Tobe is a word, but 4 letters.

Another approach: use remaining letters to form a word with O in 2 and E in 3 or 4.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try:
- B O G E T: but T is allowed, but is this a word? BOGET is not valid.
- B O D E D: not valid.
- F O G E T: FOGOT is not valid.
- G O L E D: not valid.
- T O W E L: TOWEL is valid! T O W E L:
  - T: allowed
  - O: position 2 (✓)
  - W: allowed
  - E: position 4 (allowed, since E must be in 3 or 4)
  - L: allowed
  - No excluded letters.

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O somewhere other than position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the confirmed E in position 5.
2. Uses the O in a different spot (not 3).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Introduces other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it respects the feedback).
- Uses H, U, S, but S was already ruled out, so this is bad.

Another candidate is “POLE” – but it’s only 4 letters.

Another candidate is “DOUSE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- Uses D, U, S – but S is ruled out.

Another candidate is “MONEY”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- Uses M, N, Y – all new letters.

Let's synthesize the feedback so far.

From AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in position 5.

From MONEY:
- M, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

These two facts seem contradictory: E cannot be both in position 5 and not in position 5. The only possible resolution is that the feedback for MONEY's E is indicating that E is in the word but not in position 5, which overrides the previous feedback that E is in position 5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- O is in position 2.
- A, R, S, M, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- O in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 5.
- No A, R, S, M, N, Y.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E somewhere (positions 1,3,4). Let's think of possibilities:
- Position 2 is O.
- E could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- E in position 1: EO??? (but E is not in position 5, so this is possible)
- E in position 3: ?O E ??
- E in position 4: ??O E ?

Let's think of words:
- EPOCH: E(1), O(2), C(3), H(4), none of the excluded letters. But E is in position 1, which is allowed.
- OPINE: but N is excluded.
- OPTED: D is allowed, but T and D are allowed.
- OPIUM: but U is allowed, but M is excluded.
- ELOPE: E in position 1 and 4, but L is allowed, P is allowed, but we have E in position 4 which is allowed.

But we need to check if these fit all constraints.

Let's try EPOCH:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is not restricted to position 5)
- O in position 2 (matches ✓)
- C, H are new letters
- No excluded letters (A,R,S,M,N,Y are absent)

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be OPTED:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- P, T, D are new letters
- No excluded letters

But EPOCH seems more straightforward with E in position 1.

However, we need to make sure E is in the word but not in position 5, and O is in position 2. Both EPOCH and OPTED fit.

Between these, EPOCH uses C and H which are common letters and haven't been tested yet.

I'll go with EPOCH.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Letters A, R, S, M, N, Y are excluded.

A word that fits these constraints is EPOCH, with O in position 2 and E in position 1.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: EPOCH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
→ A, R, S are out.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
→ E is in position 5.

Guess 2: MONEY  
M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
→ M, N, Y are out.  
→ O is in position 2.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Guess 3: EPOCH  
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)  
→ P, C, H are out.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known) and also NOT in position 2 (because Guess 2 said O is in position 2).  

Wait, that last point is critical: Guess 3 shows O(-) (in the word but wrong place) while position 2 of EPOCH is O. But Guess 2 already pinned O to position 2. The only way both can be true is if the feedback for EPOCH’s O is a mistake in my interpretation. Actually, the feedback for EPOCH is:
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
This means:
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- P, C, H are out.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).

Guess 2 already gave us O(✓) in position 2, so the O in EPOCH must be in position 3 (since position 2 is already taken by O). But the feedback says O(-) for position 3, which contradicts Guess 2. This suggests I misread Guess 2's O feedback.

Rechecking Guess 2: MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
This means:
- M, N, Y are out.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, in EPOCH, the O at position 3 must be the one that is ""in the word but wrong place"", confirming O is indeed in position 2 (from MONEY) and not in position 3.

So current constraints:
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from EPOCH and MONEY).
- Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, P, C, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 3 or 4.
- No excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O E _ _
- _ O _ E _

Let's brainstorm:
- DOGUE: but G and U are allowed, but word isn't valid.
- BOGIE: but I is allowed, B and G are allowed, but word is valid.
- FOYER: but Y is excluded.
- GOUGE: but G, U, E are allowed, but word is valid.
- LOEWE: but W is allowed, but double E and word is valid.
- TOEIC: but C is excluded.
- VOUGE: but G is allowed, but word isn't valid.

Looking for valid words:
- BOGIE: B O G I E → E is in position 5, but E cannot be in 5 (from MONEY). Invalid.
- GOUGE: G O U G E → E in 5, invalid.
- LOEWE: L O E W → not 5 letters, invalid.
- TOGAE: not a word.
- DOGIE: D O G I E → E in 5, invalid.

Wait, let's think differently: E must be in 3 or 4, and position 5 is not E.

So:
- _ O E _ _ : last letter not E.
- _ O _ E _ : fourth letter not E.

Valid words:
- DOGGE: not valid.
- BOGUS: S is excluded.
- FOGEY: Y is excluded.
- GOLEM: M is excluded.
- LOEWE: not valid.
- TOGAE: not valid.

Hmm, let's try:
- B O D E _ : but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- B O D E _ : need a valid word. BODE_... BODE is prefix, but not a word.
- B O X E _: X is allowed, but no valid word.
- L O B E _: Lobe is a word, but 4 letters.
- T O B E _: Tobe is a word, but 4 letters.

Another approach: use remaining letters to form a word with O in 2 and E in 3 or 4.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try:
- B O G E T: but T is allowed, but is this a word? BOGET is not valid.
- B O D E D: not valid.
- F O G E T: FOGOT is not valid.
- G O L E D: not valid.
- T O W E L: TOWEL is valid! T O W E L:
  - T: allowed
  - O: position 2 (✓)
  - W: allowed
  - E: position 4 (allowed, since E must be in 3 or 4)
  - L: allowed
  - No excluded letters.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - good consonants and vowels
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - includes three vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O somewhere other than position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the confirmed E in position 5.
2. Uses the O in a different spot (not 3).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Introduces other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

A good candidate is “HOUSE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it respects the feedback).
- Uses H, U, S, but S was already ruled out, so this is bad.

Another candidate is “POLE” – but it’s only 4 letters.

Another candidate is “DOUSE”:
- Ends with E (✓).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- Uses D, U, S – but S is ruled out.

Another candidate is “MONEY”:
- Ends with E (✓).

Let's synthesize the feedback so far.

From AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- E is in position 5.

From MONEY:
- M, N, Y are NOT in the word.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

These two facts seem contradictory: E cannot be both in position 5 and not in position 5. The only possible resolution is that the feedback for MONEY's E is indicating that E is in the word but not in position 5, which overrides the previous feedback that E is in position 5. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- O is in position 2.
- A, R, S, M, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- O in position 2.
- E somewhere except position 5.
- No A, R, S, M, N, Y.

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E somewhere (positions 1,3,4). Let's think of possibilities:
- Position 2 is O.
- E could be in 1, 3, or 4.
- Avoid the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- E in position 1: EO??? (but E is not in position 5, so this is possible)
- E in position 3: ?O E ??
- E in position 4: ??O E ?

Let's think of words:
- EPOCH: E(1), O(2), C(3), H(4), none of the excluded letters. But E is in position 1, which is allowed.
- OPINE: but N is excluded.
- OPTED: D is allowed, but T and D are allowed.
- OPIUM: but U is allowed, but M is excluded.
- ELOPE: E in position 1 and 4, but L is allowed, P is allowed, but we have E in position 4 which is allowed.

But we need to check if these fit all constraints.

Let's try EPOCH:
- E in position 1 (allowed, since E is not restricted to position 5)
- O in position 2 (matches ✓)
- C, H are new letters
- No excluded letters (A,R,S,M,N,Y are absent)

This seems valid.

Another candidate could be OPTED:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- P, T, D are new letters
- No excluded letters

But EPOCH seems more straightforward with E in position 1.

However, we need to make sure E is in the word but not in position 5, and O is in position 2. Both EPOCH and OPTED fit.

Between these, EPOCH uses C and H which are common letters and haven't been tested yet.

I'll go with EPOCH.Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- Letters A, R, S, M, N, Y are excluded.

A word that fits these constraints is EPOCH, with O in position 2 and E in position 1.

Here is some previous feedback:

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE  
A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
→ A, R, S are out.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
→ E is in position 5.

Guess 2: MONEY  
M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
→ M, N, Y are out.  
→ O is in position 2.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Guess 3: EPOCH  
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)  
→ P, C, H are out.  
→ E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
→ O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known) and also NOT in position 2 (because Guess 2 said O is in position 2).  

Wait, that last point is critical: Guess 3 shows O(-) (in the word but wrong place) while position 2 of EPOCH is O. But Guess 2 already pinned O to position 2. The only way both can be true is if the feedback for EPOCH’s O is a mistake in my interpretation. Actually, the feedback for EPOCH is:
E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
This means:
- E is in the word but not in position 1.
- P, C, H are out.
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).

Guess 2 already gave us O(✓) in position 2, so the O in EPOCH must be in position 3 (since position 2 is already taken by O). But the feedback says O(-) for position 3, which contradicts Guess 2. This suggests I misread Guess 2's O feedback.

Rechecking Guess 2: MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)  
This means:
- M, N, Y are out.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Therefore, in EPOCH, the O at position 3 must be the one that is ""in the word but wrong place"", confirming O is indeed in position 2 (from MONEY) and not in position 3.

So current constraints:
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from EPOCH and MONEY).
- Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.
- Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, P, C, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- E in position 3 or 4.
- No excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O E _ _
- _ O _ E _

Let's brainstorm:
- DOGUE: but G and U are allowed, but word isn't valid.
- BOGIE: but I is allowed, B and G are allowed, but word is valid.
- FOYER: but Y is excluded.
- GOUGE: but G, U, E are allowed, but word is valid.
- LOEWE: but W is allowed, but double E and word is valid.
- TOEIC: but C is excluded.
- VOUGE: but G is allowed, but word isn't valid.

Looking for valid words:
- BOGIE: B O G I E → E is in position 5, but E cannot be in 5 (from MONEY). Invalid.
- GOUGE: G O U G E → E in 5, invalid.
- LOEWE: L O E W → not 5 letters, invalid.
- TOGAE: not a word.
- DOGIE: D O G I E → E in 5, invalid.

Wait, let's think differently: E must be in 3 or 4, and position 5 is not E.

So:
- _ O E _ _ : last letter not E.
- _ O _ E _ : fourth letter not E.

Valid words:
- DOGGE: not valid.
- BOGUS: S is excluded.
- FOGEY: Y is excluded.
- GOLEM: M is excluded.
- LOEWE: not valid.
- TOGAE: not valid.

Hmm, let's try:
- B O D E _ : but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- B O D E _ : need a valid word. BODE_... BODE is prefix, but not a word.
- B O X E _: X is allowed, but no valid word.
- L O B E _: Lobe is a word, but 4 letters.
- T O B E _: Tobe is a word, but 4 letters.

Another approach: use remaining letters to form a word with O in 2 and E in 3 or 4.

Possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try:
- B O G E T: but T is allowed, but is this a word? BOGET is not valid.
- B O D E D: not valid.
- F O G E T: FOGOT is not valid.
- G O L E D: not valid.
- T O W E L: TOWEL is valid! T O W E L:
  - T: allowed
  - O: position 2 (✓)
  - W: allowed
  - E: position 4 (allowed, since E must be in 3 or 4)
  - L: allowed
  - No excluded letters.

This fits all constraints.

Let’s update the accumulated knowledge after four guesses.

Excluded letters (x-marked):  
A, R, S, M, N, Y, P, C, H, T, W, L

Confirmed positions:  
- Position 2 = O (from MONEY and TOWEL)

Confirmed letters (somewhere in word):  
- E (from AROSE, MONEY, EPOCH, TOWEL)

Forbidden positions for E:  
- 1 (EPOCH)  
- 5 (MONEY)  
- 4 (TOWEL)  

Hence E must be in position 3.

Word skeleton so far:  
_ O E _ _

Remaining alphabet letters not yet excluded:  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, Q, U, V, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word fitting  
B O E _ _ , D O E _ _ , F O E _ _ , G O E _ _ , etc.

Scanning possibilities:  
- BOED_ → no valid word  
- DOED_ → DOED is archaic/dialectal, not standard  
- FOED_ → obsolete spelling of “flood”, but no common 5-letter form  
- GOED_ → not a word  
- BOGIE → E in 3, but I is allowed, G is allowed, word is valid  
- BOGIE: B O G I E  
  – B, O, G, I, E all allowed  
  – E in position 3 (required)  
  – O in position 2 (required)  
  – No excluded letters

No other obvious candidate, so BOGIE is the logical next guess.
