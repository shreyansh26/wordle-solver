For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is the 3rd letter
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains R (but not in position 2)
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already used)

A good next guess would use new consonants and the remaining vowels. The word ""FRONT"" comes to mind:
- F, R, N, T are all new consonants
- O is in the correct position
- R is in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2, so this is invalid)

Let me try ""ROUND"":
- U is a new vowel
- R is in position 1 (valid, since R can be in position 1)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- N and D are new consonants
- Doesn't contain A, S, or E

Let’s tabulate what we now know:

1. From AROSE  
   A(x)  → A not in word  
   R(-) → R is in word but not in position 2  
   O(✓) → O is in position 3  
   S(x) → S not in word  
   E(x) → E not in word  

2. From ROUND  
   R(✓) → R is in position 1 (exact match)  
   O(-) → O is in word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3)  
   U(x) → U not in word  
   N(x) → N not in word  
   D(x) → D not in word  

The feedback from ROUND directly conflicts with the earlier ✓ for O in position 3. The only way both sets of feedback can be true is if the letter O appears twice in the secret word: once in position 3 (as originally marked) and once elsewhere (as now indicated by the “-” for O in ROUND). Therefore, the secret word must contain two O’s, with one of them fixed in position 3.

So the word must:
- Have R in position 1  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Contain none of A, S, E, U, N, D  

Remaining consonants to draw from (excluding A, S, E, U, N, D): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the second O. If we put it in position 2, we get R O _ O _.  
A valid word fitting this pattern is “ROTOR”.  
Check letters: R, O, T, O, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, S, E, U, N, D) appear, and it satisfies both sets of feedback.

Therefore, “ROTOR” is a strong candidate for the next guess.

Let’s reconcile all feedback so far.

1. From AROSE:
   A(x) – A not in word  
   R(-) – R is in word but not in position 2  
   O(✓) – O is in position 3  
   S(x) – S not in word  
   E(x) – E not in word  

2. From ROUND:
   R(✓) – R is in position 1  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 3  
   U(x) – U not in word  
   N(x) – N not in word  
   D(x) – D not in word  

3. From ROTOR:
   R(✓) – R is in position 1  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 2  
   T(-) – T is in word but not in position 3  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 4  
   R(-) – R is in word but not in position 5  

The feedback from ROUND and ROTOR now tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicting the earlier ✓ from AROSE).  
  The only consistent interpretation is that the secret word contains two O’s: one fixed in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O elsewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).  
- R is in position 1 (from ROUND and ROTOR).  
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR).  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.  

So the word must:
- Start with R  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O in position 2, 4, or 5  
- Contain T somewhere not in position 3  
- Use only remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Possible patterns:
- R O _ _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O O _ (second O in 4)  

Let’s try R _ O O _ (second O in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 5.  
A valid word: R O O K Y – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have limited options.  
Another: R O O M Y – also questionable.  
A more common word: R O O F Y – but F and Y are allowed.  

However, the feedback says T is in the word (from ROTOR).  
So we must include T.  

Let’s try R _ O T O (second O in 5, T in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2.  
A valid word: R I O T O – but I is a vowel we haven’t ruled out, and we haven’t used I yet.  
Letters: R, I, O, T, O – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 5 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  

Thus, “RIOTO” is a valid candidate.  
But “RIOTO” is not a common English word.  

Another option: R _ O T O with a different consonant.  
R B O T O – not a word.  
R C O T O – not a word.  
R F O T O – not a word.  

Try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R _ O _ T  
Need consonants in 2 and 4.  
A common word: R O O T S – but S is forbidden.  
R O O T Y – Y is allowed, but O is already in 3.  

Wait, let’s try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R B O C T – not a word.  

Try R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R _ O T _  
Need consonant in 2 and 5.  
A valid word: R I O T S – S forbidden.  
R I O T Y – valid: R I O T Y (means “to riot”).  

Let’s check letters: R, I, O, T, Y – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  
- Second O must be in 5 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR), but R I O T Y has O in 3 and 4, not 5.  

We need the second O in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try second O in 2: R O _ _ _  
Then T must be in 4 or 5.  
R O _ T _ or R O _ _ T.  
A common word: R O B T Y – not a word.  
R O C T Y – not a word.  
R O F T Y – not a word.  

Try R O _ _ T: R O C K T – not a word.  

Try second O in 5: R _ _ _ O  
Then T must be in 3 (but feedback says T is not in 3) or 2 or 4.  
R _ T _ O – T in 3 is forbidden.  
R _ _ T O – T in 4: R I C T O – not a word.  

After reviewing, the most plausible common word that fits is “R I O T Y” even though it’s less common, or we can try “R O O T Y” which is a bit more common but has O in 3 and 4.  

However, “R O O T Y” has O in 3 and 4, which aligns with:
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 4 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR)  
- T in 4 (from T(-) in ROTOR) – but T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Wait, in ROTOR, T was in position 3 and marked (-), so T cannot be in 3.  
In R O O T Y, T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid candidate.  

Let me verify:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 4 (new position) ✓  
- T in 4 – but T is already in 4, and we have O in 4.  
Wait, “ROOTY” is R O O T Y, so T is in 4 and O is in 3 and 4.  

But we have 5 letters, so positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:Y.  

This satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 2 and 4 – but we only have one O in the word? No, we have two O’s (positions 2 and 3).  
- T in 4 ✓ (from T(-) in ROTOR)  
- Y in 5 – allowed  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid guess.  

However, let me check for a more common word.  

Another option: R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R I O T _ – need consonant in 5: R I O T Y – same as above.  

Thus, the best guess is “ROOTY”.

But let me double-check the letters:  
ROOTY: R, O, O, T, Y.  
Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D – none present.  

Therefore, the next guess is ROOTY.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the secret word must:
- Start with R (from ROUND and ROTOR)  
- Have O in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- Contain T (from ROTOR) but not in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Avoid A, S, E, U, N, D  

A valid word fitting these constraints is “ROOTY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is the 3rd letter
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains R (but not in position 2)
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already used)

A good next guess would use new consonants and the remaining vowels. The word ""FRONT"" comes to mind:
- F, R, N, T are all new consonants
- O is in the correct position
- R is in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2, so this is invalid)

Let me try ""ROUND"":
- U is a new vowel
- R is in position 1 (valid, since R can be in position 1)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- N and D are new consonants
- Doesn't contain A, S, or E

This seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s tabulate what we now know:

1. From AROSE  
   A(x)  → A not in word  
   R(-) → R is in word but not in position 2  
   O(✓) → O is in position 3  
   S(x) → S not in word  
   E(x) → E not in word  

2. From ROUND  
   R(✓) → R is in position 1 (exact match)  
   O(-) → O is in word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts Guess 1 where O was marked ✓ in position 3)  
   U(x) → U not in word  
   N(x) → N not in word  
   D(x) → D not in word  

The feedback from ROUND directly conflicts with the earlier ✓ for O in position 3. The only way both sets of feedback can be true is if the letter O appears twice in the secret word: once in position 3 (as originally marked) and once elsewhere (as now indicated by the “-” for O in ROUND). Therefore, the secret word must contain two O’s, with one of them fixed in position 3.

So the word must:
- Have R in position 1  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Contain none of A, S, E, U, N, D  

Remaining consonants to draw from (excluding A, S, E, U, N, D): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the second O. If we put it in position 2, we get R O _ O _.  
A valid word fitting this pattern is “ROTOR”.  
Check letters: R, O, T, O, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, S, E, U, N, D) appear, and it satisfies both sets of feedback.

Therefore, “ROTOR” is a strong candidate for the next guess.

   R(-) – R is in word but not in position 5  

The feedback from ROUND and ROTOR now tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicting the earlier ✓ from AROSE).  
  The only consistent interpretation is that the secret word contains two O’s: one fixed in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O elsewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).  
- R is in position 1 (from ROUND and ROTOR).  
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR).  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.  

So the word must:
- Start with R  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O in position 2, 4, or 5  
- Contain T somewhere not in position 3  
- Use only remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Possible patterns:
- R O _ _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O O _ (second O in 4)  

Let’s try R _ O O _ (second O in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 5.  
A valid word: R O O K Y – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have limited options.  
Another: R O O M Y – also questionable.  
A more common word: R O O F Y – but F and Y are allowed.  

However, the feedback says T is in the word (from ROTOR).  
So we must include T.  

Let’s try R _ O T O (second O in 5, T in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2.  
A valid word: R I O T O – but I is a vowel we haven’t ruled out, and we haven’t used I yet.  
Letters: R, I, O, T, O – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 5 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  

Thus, “RIOTO” is a valid candidate.  
But “RIOTO” is not a common English word.  

Another option: R _ O T O with a different consonant.  
R B O T O – not a word.  
R C O T O – not a word.  
R F O T O – not a word.  

Try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R _ O _ T  
Need consonants in 2 and 4.  
A common word: R O O T S – but S is forbidden.  
R O O T Y – Y is allowed, but O is already in 3.  

Wait, let’s try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R B O C T – not a word.  

Try R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R _ O T _  
Need consonant in 2 and 5.  
A valid word: R I O T S – S forbidden.  
R I O T Y – valid: R I O T Y (means “to riot”).  

Let’s check letters: R, I, O, T, Y – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  
- Second O must be in 5 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR), but R I O T Y has O in 3 and 4, not 5.  

We need the second O in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try second O in 2: R O _ _ _  
Then T must be in 4 or 5.  
R O _ T _ or R O _ _ T.  
A common word: R O B T Y – not a word.  
R O C T Y – not a word.  
R O F T Y – not a word.  

Try R O _ _ T: R O C K T – not a word.  

Try second O in 5: R _ _ _ O  
Then T must be in 3 (but feedback says T is not in 3) or 2 or 4.  
R _ T _ O – T in 3 is forbidden.  
R _ _ T O – T in 4: R I C T O – not a word.  

After reviewing, the most plausible common word that fits is “R I O T Y” even though it’s less common, or we can try “R O O T Y” which is a bit more common but has O in 3 and 4.  

However, “R O O T Y” has O in 3 and 4, which aligns with:
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 4 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR)  
- T in 4 (from T(-) in ROTOR) – but T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Wait, in ROTOR, T was in position 3 and marked (-), so T cannot be in 3.  
In R O O T Y, T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid candidate.  

Let me verify:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 4 (new position) ✓  
- T in 4 – but T is already in 4, and we have O in 4.  
Wait, “ROOTY” is R O O T Y, so T is in 4 and O is in 3 and 4.  

But we have 5 letters, so positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:Y.  

This satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 2 and 4 – but we only have one O in the word? No, we have two O’s (positions 2 and 3).  
- T in 4 ✓ (from T(-) in ROTOR)  
- Y in 5 – allowed  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid guess.  

However, let me check for a more common word.  

Another option: R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R I O T _ – need consonant in 5: R I O T Y – same as above.  

Thus, the best guess is “ROOTY”.

But let me double-check the letters:  
ROOTY: R, O, O, T, Y.  
Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D – none present.  

Therefore, the next guess is ROOTY.Based on the feedback, the secret word must:
- Start with R (from ROUND and ROTOR)  
- Have O in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- Contain T (from ROTOR) but not in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Avoid A, S, E, U, N, D  

A valid word fitting these constraints is “ROOTY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can provide valuable information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → O is the 3rd letter
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position
2. Contains R (but not in position 2)
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, U (since O is already used)

A good next guess would use new consonants and the remaining vowels. The word ""FRONT"" comes to mind:
- F, R, N, T are all new consonants
- O is in the correct position
- R is in position 2 (but we know R can't be in position 2, so this is invalid)

Let me try ""ROUND"":
- U is a new vowel
- R is in position 1 (valid, since R can be in position 1)
- O is in position 3 (correct)

   U(x) → U not in word  
   N(x) → N not in word  
   D(x) → D not in word  

The feedback from ROUND directly conflicts with the earlier ✓ for O in position 3. The only way both sets of feedback can be true is if the letter O appears twice in the secret word: once in position 3 (as originally marked) and once elsewhere (as now indicated by the “-” for O in ROUND). Therefore, the secret word must contain two O’s, with one of them fixed in position 3.

So the word must:
- Have R in position 1  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Contain none of A, S, E, U, N, D  

Remaining consonants to draw from (excluding A, S, E, U, N, D): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the second O. If we put it in position 2, we get R O _ O _.  
A valid word fitting this pattern is “ROTOR”.  
Check letters: R, O, T, O, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, S, E, U, N, D) appear, and it satisfies both sets of feedback.

Therefore, “ROTOR” is a strong candidate for the next guess.

Let’s reconcile all feedback so far.

1. From AROSE:
   A(x) – A not in word  
   R(-) – R is in word but not in position 2  
   O(✓) – O is in position 3  
   S(x) – S not in word  
   E(x) – E not in word  

2. From ROUND:
   R(✓) – R is in position 1  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 3  
   U(x) – U not in word  
   N(x) – N not in word  
   D(x) – D not in word  

3. From ROTOR:
   R(✓) – R is in position 1  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 2  
   T(-) – T is in word but not in position 3  
   O(-) – O is in word but not in position 4  
   R(-) – R is in word but not in position 5  

The feedback from ROUND and ROTOR now tells us:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicting the earlier ✓ from AROSE).  
  The only consistent interpretation is that the secret word contains two O’s: one fixed in position 3 (from AROSE) and another O elsewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).  
- R is in position 1 (from ROUND and ROTOR).  
- T is in the word but not in position 3 (from ROTOR).  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, U, N, D.  

So the word must:
- Start with R  
- Have O in position 3  
- Have another O in position 2, 4, or 5  
- Contain T somewhere not in position 3  
- Use only remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Possible patterns:
- R O _ _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O _ O (second O in 5)  
- R _ O O _ (second O in 4)  

Let’s try R _ O O _ (second O in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2 and a consonant in position 5.  
A valid word: R O O K Y – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we have limited options.  
Another: R O O M Y – also questionable.  
A more common word: R O O F Y – but F and Y are allowed.  

However, the feedback says T is in the word (from ROTOR).  
So we must include T.  

Let’s try R _ O T O (second O in 5, T in 4).  
We need a consonant in position 2.  
A valid word: R I O T O – but I is a vowel we haven’t ruled out, and we haven’t used I yet.  
Letters: R, I, O, T, O – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 5 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  

Thus, “RIOTO” is a valid candidate.  
But “RIOTO” is not a common English word.  

Another option: R _ O T O with a different consonant.  
R B O T O – not a word.  
R C O T O – not a word.  
R F O T O – not a word.  

Try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R _ O _ T  
Need consonants in 2 and 4.  
A common word: R O O T S – but S is forbidden.  
R O O T Y – Y is allowed, but O is already in 3.  

Wait, let’s try R _ O _ T with O in 3 and T in 5:  
R B O C T – not a word.  

Try R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R _ O T _  
Need consonant in 2 and 5.  
A valid word: R I O T S – S forbidden.  
R I O T Y – valid: R I O T Y (means “to riot”).  

Let’s check letters: R, I, O, T, Y – none of the forbidden letters, and it satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- T in 4 ✓  
- Second O must be in 5 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR), but R I O T Y has O in 3 and 4, not 5.  

We need the second O in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try second O in 2: R O _ _ _  
Then T must be in 4 or 5.  
R O _ T _ or R O _ _ T.  
A common word: R O B T Y – not a word.  
R O C T Y – not a word.  
R O F T Y – not a word.  

Try R O _ _ T: R O C K T – not a word.  

Try second O in 5: R _ _ _ O  
Then T must be in 3 (but feedback says T is not in 3) or 2 or 4.  
R _ T _ O – T in 3 is forbidden.  
R _ _ T O – T in 4: R I C T O – not a word.  

After reviewing, the most plausible common word that fits is “R I O T Y” even though it’s less common, or we can try “R O O T Y” which is a bit more common but has O in 3 and 4.  

However, “R O O T Y” has O in 3 and 4, which aligns with:
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 4 (from O(-) in ROUND and ROTOR)  
- T in 4 (from T(-) in ROTOR) – but T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Wait, in ROTOR, T was in position 3 and marked (-), so T cannot be in 3.  
In R O O T Y, T is in 4, which is allowed.  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid candidate.  

Let me verify:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓  
- O in 4 (new position) ✓  
- T in 4 – but T is already in 4, and we have O in 4.  
Wait, “ROOTY” is R O O T Y, so T is in 4 and O is in 3 and 4.  

But we have 5 letters, so positions: 1:R, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:Y.  

This satisfies:
- R in 1 ✓  
- O in 3 ✓ (from AROSE)  
- O in 2 and 4 – but we only have one O in the word? No, we have two O’s (positions 2 and 3).  
- T in 4 ✓ (from T(-) in ROTOR)  
- Y in 5 – allowed  

Thus, “ROOTY” is a valid guess.  

However, let me check for a more common word.  

Another option: R _ O T _ with O in 3 and T in 4:  
R I O T _ – need consonant in 5: R I O T Y – same as above.  

Thus, the best guess is “ROOTY”.

But let me double-check the letters:  
ROOTY: R, O, O, T, Y.  
Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D – none present.  

Therefore, the next guess is ROOTY.Based on the feedback, the secret word must:
- Start with R (from ROUND and ROTOR)  
- Have O in position 3 (from AROSE)  
- Contain T (from ROTOR) but not in position 3  
- Have another O somewhere else (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Avoid A, S, E, U, N, D  

A valid word fitting these constraints is “ROOTY”.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. The word starts with R (position 1).
2. Position 3 is O (from AROSE).
3. Position 4 is T (from ROOTY).
4. Position 5 is Y (from ROOTY).
5. There is another O in the word, but it is NOT in position 2 (from ROUND and ROTOR).
6. Forbidden letters: A, S, E, U, N, D.

Given the pattern R _ O T Y, the only remaining position for the second O is position 2. However, the feedback from ROUND and ROTOR indicates that O is NOT in position 2. This creates a contradiction.

The only way to resolve this is to realize that the second O must be in position 3, but position 3 is already occupied by O (from AROSE). This implies the word must have two O's: one in position 3 and another in position 2, but position 2 O was marked as wrong in ROUND and ROTOR.

This suggests the word must be R O O T Y, where:
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (even though earlier feedback said O is not in position 2, this might be an exception)
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Given the constraints, ""ROOTY"" was already guessed and all letters are confirmed except the position of the second O. Since we have no other valid options, the word must be ""ROOTY"".

Since positions 3,4,5 are taken, the only remaining place for the second O is position 2. Thus, the word must be R O O T Y.
