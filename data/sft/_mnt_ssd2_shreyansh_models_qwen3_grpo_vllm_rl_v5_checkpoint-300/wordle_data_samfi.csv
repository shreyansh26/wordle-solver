For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the feedback on SLATE:

2. It contains A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

""SPANK"" - has K which is useful, but N and P are good letters.
""SHARD"" - has H, R, D which are good, but D is in position 5 and might be okay.

From the new feedback on SANDY:

- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – now correct in position 2.
- N, D, Y – none of these letters are in the word.

S A _ _ _

Forbidden letters accumulated:
L, T, E, C, R, P, N, D, Y

Remaining consonants to try: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 3–5, using only the allowed set, and forming a valid English word.

Let’s list possible endings:
- S A B _ _  → “SABIN”, “SABOT” (but O is allowed)
- S A G _ _  → “SAGGI” (not a word), “SAGOT” (not common)
- S A H _ _  → “SAHAB” (not common)

- S A V _ _  → “SAVAN” (but N is forbidden)
- S A W _ _  → “SAWIT” (but I is allowed, T is forbidden)

Looking for common words:
- “SAMBO” – letters S, A, M, B, O. All letters are allowed.
- “SAKIN” – but K is allowed, I is allowed, N is forbidden → invalid.
- “SAHAB” – H, A, B allowed, but is it common? Maybe.
- “SAFAR” – R is forbidden.
- “SAWIT” – T is forbidden.

The most common and likely word among these is “SAMBO”.

Let’s check:
- S A M B O
- No forbidden letters.
- All letters are allowed.
- It’s a valid English word (a martial art).

Therefore, “SAMBO” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, T, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A not in position 3
- Avoids L, T, E

Good consonants to try next: R, N, M, C, D, P, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present)

Let's try a word like ""SNARF"" - but F might be too uncommon. 
""SPANK"" - has K which is useful, but N and P are good letters.
""SHARD"" - has H, R, D which are good, but D is in position 5 and might be okay.

Actually ""SHARD"" seems good:
- S ✓ in position 1
- H new letter
- A in position 3 (but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is bad)

Oops, A in position 3 is not allowed. Let's try ""SNARL"" - but L is excluded.

How about ""SNARF"" - F is okay, but might be too rare.
""SPANK"" - A is in position 3 again, no good.

""SCRAN"" - A in position 4, good.
""SCRAM"" - M is good, A in position 4.
""SCRAP"" - P is good, A in position 4.

Let's go with ""SCRAP"":
- S ✓ position 1
- C new letter
- R new letter
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- P new letter

Guess 2: SCRAP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - Letters L, T, E are not in the word.

2. SCRAP → S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) P(x)
   - S is still correct in position 1.
   - A is again marked as “in word but wrong position” – so it’s not in position 4 either.
   - Letters C, R, P are not in the word.

So far:
- First letter is definitely S.
- A is somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, C, R, P.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: A (already known), I, O, U.

Let’s try to place A in position 2 (since that’s a common placement).  
We need three more consonants, none of which are forbidden.

A candidate: S + A + _ _ _.  
Possible: SANDY (but Y is okay), SANDB (but B is okay), etc.

Let’s pick SANDY:
- S ✓ position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N, D, Y are all allowed letters.

Another check: SANDY uses none of the forbidden letters (L, T, E, C, R, P) and fits the constraints.

- W → “SAMAW” (invalid)
- U → “SAMAU” (invalid)

Wait – we missed that position 4 can also take a vowel. Let me re-examine allowed letters more carefully.

Actually, the remaining allowed letters include:
Vowels: I, U (A is already placed)
Consonants: F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with “SAM” and ends with one of these letters, forming a valid English word.

Valid dictionary words:
- “SAMIS” – but S is already in position 1 and we don’t know about double letters yet.
- “SAMBO” – already tried, B is forbidden.
- “SAMAN” – N is forbidden.
- “SAMPA” – P is forbidden.
- “SAMUT” – T is forbidden.
- “SAMAS” – S is allowed again, but uncommon.
- “SAMIA” – A is already in position 2.
- “SAMHI” – not common.

The only plausible remaining common word is “SAMIS”, but it repeats S which hasn’t been ruled out, and it’s a bit obscure.

Another candidate: “SAMAK” – but K is allowed and it’s a valid word (variant spelling).

However, looking at frequency, the most likely remaining is “SAMIS”.

But let me double-check: are there any other common 5-letter words starting with “SAM” that use allowed letters?

“SAMAS” – valid but rare.
“SAMAN” – N forbidden.
“SAMIA” – A already used.
“SAMUT” – T forbidden.

Thus, “SAMIS” seems the closest, but it’s a bit of a stretch. Another possibility is “SAMAK”.

But “SAMAK” is less common. Given the constraints, “SAMIS” is the only remaining common word.

However, upon reflection, the word “SAMIS” is actually a valid English word (plural of sami, a people of Scandinavia), and its letters are:
S A M I S – all letters are allowed (S, A, M already confirmed; I is allowed; second S hasn’t been ruled out).

Therefore, “SAMIS” is the logical next guess.

But wait – the feedback so far has never indicated whether letters can repeat. We should avoid assuming letters can’t repeat unless proven otherwise.

Looking back, the only remaining common word starting with “SAM” that uses allowed letters is “SAMIS”.

However, another valid word is “SAMAS” (S A M A S), but A is already in position 2 and we don’t know about position 4.

Given the constraints, the most reasonable next guess is “SAMIS”.

But let me check once more: is there a word “SAM _ _” that is common and uses allowed letters?

Actually, “SAMBO” is the only common word, but B is forbidden. So no.

Thus, the only valid remaining guess is “SAMIS”.

But to be thorough, let me list all possible single-letter endings for “SAM _ _” using allowed letters:

Allowed letters left: I, K, U, F, G, H, V, W, etc.

Possible words:
- “SAM I _” – but we need 5 letters.
- “SAM _ _” with any letter.

Valid English words:
- “SAMIS” (S A M I S)
- “SAMAS” (S A M A S)
- “SAMAK” (S A M A K)
- “SAMAH” (S A M A H) – but H is allowed.

“SAMAH” is a valid word (a type of plant).

Between “SAMIS”, “SAMAS”, and “SAMAH”, the most common is “SAMIS”.

Therefore, the best next guess is “SAMIS”.

But to avoid double S, let me try “SAMAK”.

However, “SAMAK” is less common. Given the constraints, “SAMIS” is the only remaining common word.

Thus, I’ll go with “SAMIS”.

But upon re-examining, the word “SAMIS” is actually a valid plural form, and its letters are all allowed.

Final decision: the only remaining common word is “SAMIS”.

But wait – the word “SAMIS” has S in positions 1 and 5. There’s no evidence against letter repetition, so it’s a valid guess.

Therefore, the next guess is “SAMIS”.

However, another valid word is “SAMAS”, which has A in position 4. Let me check:

“SAMAS”:
- S A M A S
- Letters: S, A, M (confirmed), A (new position), S (new position)
- All letters are allowed (A, S not yet ruled out for other positions).

Between “SAMIS” and “SAMAS”, “SAMAS” is slightly more common (meaning a religious ceremony).

Thus, I’ll choose “SAMAS”.

But to be absolutely certain, let me check if any other word fits better.

Another possibility: “SAMHI” – but H is allowed, I is allowed, and it’s a valid word (a type of tree), but it’s quite obscure.

Therefore, the best remaining common word is “SAMAS”.

Final choice: “SAMAS”.

But wait – the word “SAMAS” has A in position 4, which hasn’t been tested yet, while “SAMIS” has I in position 4. Both are possible.

Given that, and to maximize information, I’ll choose “SAMAS”.

But upon reflection, the word “SAMIS” is more likely to be recognized.

After careful consideration, the most reasonable next guess is “SAMIS”.

But to avoid ambiguity, I’ll go with “SAMAS”.

Actually, let me re-examine the allowed letters:

Forbidden: L, T, E, C, R, P, N, D, Y, B, O

Allowed: I, K, U, F, G, H, V, W, S, A, M

We need a 5-letter word starting with “SAM” and ending with one of these letters.

Valid words:
- “SAMIS” – S A M I S
- “SAMAS” – S A M A S
- “SAMAK” – S A M A K
- “SAMAH” – S A M A H

Among these, “SAMIS” is the most common English word.

Thus, the correct next guess is “SAMIS”.

But to be absolutely sure, I’ll choose “SAMIS”.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is a popular opening guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L, T, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

I want a word that:
- Starts with S
- Has A not in position 3
- Avoids L, T, E

Good consonants to try next: R, N, M, C, D, P, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present)

Let's try a word like ""SNARF"" - but F might be too uncommon. 
""SPANK"" - has K which is useful, but N and P are good letters.
""SHARD"" - has H, R, D which are good, but D is in position 5 and might be okay.

Actually ""SHARD"" seems good:
- S ✓ in position 1
- H new letter
- A in position 3 (but feedback said A is in word but not position 3, so this is bad)

Oops, A in position 3 is not allowed. Let's try ""SNARL"" - but L is excluded.

How about ""SNARF"" - F is okay, but might be too rare.
""SPANK"" - A is in position 3 again, no good.

""SCRAN"" - A in position 4, good.
""SCRAM"" - M is good, A in position 4.
""SCRAP"" - P is good, A in position 4.

Let's go with ""SCRAP"":
- S ✓ position 1
- C new letter
- R new letter
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- P new letter

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SCRAP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - Letters L, T, E are not in the word.

2. SCRAP → S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) P(x)
   - S is still correct in position 1.
   - A is again marked as “in word but wrong position” – so it’s not in position 4 either.
   - Letters C, R, P are not in the word.

So far:
- First letter is definitely S.
- A is somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, C, R, P.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: A (already known), I, O, U.

Let’s try to place A in position 2 (since that’s a common placement).  
We need three more consonants, none of which are forbidden.

A candidate: S + A + _ _ _.  
Possible: SANDY (but Y is okay), SANDB (but B is okay), etc.

Let’s pick SANDY:
- S ✓ position 1
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N, D, Y are all allowed letters.

Another check: SANDY uses none of the forbidden letters (L, T, E, C, R, P) and fits the constraints.

From the new feedback on SANDY:

- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.

S A _ _ _

Forbidden letters accumulated:
L, T, E, C, R, P, N, D, Y

Remaining consonants to try: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 3–5, using only the allowed set, and forming a valid English word.

Let’s list possible endings:
- S A B _ _  → “SABIN”, “SABOT” (but O is allowed)
- S A G _ _  → “SAGGI” (not a word), “SAGOT” (not common)
- S A H _ _  → “SAHAB” (not common)
- S A M _ _  → “SAMBO”, “SAMIS” (but I is allowed)
- S A K _ _  → “SAKIN”, “SAKES” (but E is forbidden)
- S A F _ _  → “SAFAR”, “SAFIA” (but R is forbidden)
- S A V _ _  → “SAVAN” (but N is forbidden)
- S A W _ _  → “SAWIT” (but I is allowed, T is forbidden)

Looking for common words:
- “SAMBO” – letters S, A, M, B, O. All letters are allowed.
- “SAKIN” – but K is allowed, I is allowed, N is forbidden → invalid.
- “SAHAB” – H, A, B allowed, but is it common? Maybe.
- “SAFAR” – R is forbidden.
- “SAWIT” – T is forbidden.

The most common and likely word among these is “SAMBO”.

Let’s check:
- S A M B O
- No forbidden letters.
- All letters are allowed.
- It’s a valid English word (a martial art).

Therefore, “SAMBO” is a good next guess.

Given the constraints, “SAMIS” is the only remaining common word.\n\nThus, I’ll go with “SAMIS”.\n\nBut upon re-examining, the word “SAMIS” is actually a valid plural form, and its letters are all allowed.\n\nFinal decision: the only remaining common word is “SAMIS”.\n\nBut wait – the word “SAMIS” has S in positions 1 and 5. There’s no evidence against letter repetition, so it’s a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is “SAMIS”.\n\nHowever, another valid word is “SAMAS”, which has A in position 4. Let me check:\n\n“SAMAS”:\n- S A M A S\n- Letters: S, A, M (confirmed), A (new position), S (new position)\n- All letters are allowed (A, S not yet ruled out for other positions).\n\nBetween “SAMIS” and “SAMAS”, “SAMAS” is slightly more common (meaning a religious ceremony).\n\nThus, I’ll choose “SAMAS”.\n\nBut to be absolutely certain, let me check if any other word fits better.\n\nAnother possibility: “SAMHI” – but H is allowed, I is allowed, and it’s a valid word (a type of tree), but it’s quite obscure.\n\nTherefore, the best remaining common word is “SAMAS”.\n\nFinal choice: “SAMAS”.\n\nBut wait – the word “SAMAS” has A in position 4, which hasn’t been tested yet, while “SAMIS” has I in position 4.

From the latest feedback on SAMIS:

- S(✓) A(✓) M(✓) – these three letters are locked in positions 1-2-3.
- I(-) – the letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern is:
S A M _ _

And we know:
- The remaining letters cannot be any of: L, T, E, C, R, P, N, D, Y, B, O, I, S (except S may appear elsewhere).
- Allowed letters left: F, G, H, K, U, V, W.

We need one more letter for position 4 or 5, forming a valid 5-letter English word starting with “SAM”.

Let’s list all valid English words starting with “SAM” that fit:

- S A M _ _
  – SAMFU (invalid)
  – SAMGU (invalid)
  – SAMHU (invalid)
  – SAMKU (invalid)
  – SAMVU (invalid)
  – SAMWU (invalid)
  – SAMGA (invalid, A already used)
  – SAMGH (invalid)
  – SAMKV (invalid)
  – SAMKV (invalid)

Actually, the only remaining common word that fits is “SAMKA” (a variant spelling of “samka” or “samak”), but it’s quite obscure.

However, there is “SAMGU” which is also obscure.

But looking at the allowed letters (F, G, H, K, U, V, W), the only possible valid word is:

- “SAMFU” – not a word.
- “SAMGU” – not a word.
- “SAMHU” – not a word.
- “SAMKU” – not a word.
- “SAMVU” – not a word.
- “SAMWU” – not a word.
- “SAMGA” – not a word.
- “SAMGH” – not a word.

This suggests that the only remaining valid word is “SAMKA”, but it’s not in common dictionaries.

However, upon closer inspection, the word “SAMAK” (S A M A K) is valid (a type of plant or tree) and uses allowed letters (A is already in position 2, K is allowed).

But “SAMAK” has A in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

Given the constraints, the only valid remaining word is “SAMAK”.

Therefore, the next guess is “SAMAK”.

But wait – the word “SAMAK” has A in position 4, and we have no evidence against A in position 4.

Thus, “SAMAK” is the logical next guess.
