### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓ at position 5).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I now need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids those four letters.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already fixed).

A strong next guess should test several of the remaining common letters.  
The word “UNTIE” ends in E and uses U, N, T, I, none of which have been ruled out.  
Let’s try it.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities quickly. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal many letters early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓ at position 5).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all (x).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I now need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids those four letters.  
Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already fixed).

A strong next guess should test several of the remaining common letters.  
The word “UNTIE” ends in E and uses U, N, T, I, none of which have been ruled out.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ I M _ E  (positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: I, M, E)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, W, P
- Remaining available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 2
2. Has M in position 4
3. Has E in position 5
4. Uses only the allowed letters for positions 1 and 3

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 3:
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: same list (but must form a valid word)

Looking for common words fitting _ I M _ E:
- B I M B E – ""BIMBE"" (not a valid English word)
- D I M D E – ""DIMDE"" (invalid)
- F I M I E – ""FIMIE"" (invalid)
- G I M I E – ""GIMIE"" (invalid)
- J I M I E – ""JIMIE"" (invalid)
- K I M K E – ""KIMKE"" (invalid)
- L I M E _ – ""LIME_"" (but we need _ I M _ E)
- V I M V E – ""VIMVE"" (invalid)
- F I M E _ – doesn't fit pattern
- D I M E _ – doesn't fit pattern

Wait, let's think differently: the word must be _ I M _ E with valid English word.
Possible valid words:
- ""F I M E R"" – but ends in R, not E
- ""B I M E R"" – same
- ""D I M E R"" – same
- ""G I M E R"" – same
- ""K I M E R"" – same
- ""L I M E R"" – ""LIMER"" (valid, but archaic)
- ""V I M E R"" – ""VIMER"" (invalid)
- ""F I M E D"" – doesn't fit
- ""D I M E D"" – doesn't fit

Actually, ""LIMER"" is a valid 5-letter word (archaic for limerick). But let's check:
L: allowed
I: correct position 2
M: correct position 4
E: correct position 5
R: but R is banned (from AROSE feedback)

So ""LIMER"" is invalid because of R.

Next possible word: ""F I M E D"" – but doesn't fit _ I M _ E.

Wait, let's list all possible _ I M _ E with allowed letters:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? I ? M E

Possible letters for 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English words:
- ""F I M E D"" – no
- ""B I M E D"" – no
- ""D I M E D"" – no
- ""G I M E D"" – no
- ""K I M E D"" – no
- ""L I M E D"" – ""LIMED"" (valid word)

""LIMED"" fits:
- L: allowed
- I: position 2 ✓
- M: position 4 ✓
- E: position 5 ✓
- D: allowed

Let's check if any letters are banned: L, I, M, E, D – none are banned.

Thus, ""LIMED"" is a valid guess.

From the latest feedback on LIMED:
- I is correct in position 2 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ I M _ _  (positions 2 and 4 are fixed)
The final letter must NOT be E, even though E is in the word somewhere. This implies E must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ I M E _

Available letters (excluding banned: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, W, P, L, D)
Remaining: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking at valid English words ending in -IME?:
Actually, the word must be _ I M E _ (4 letters: I, M, E plus two others). But we need 5 letters.

Wait, the pattern is: position 1 I position 3 M position 4 E position 5 ?

But from feedback:
- position 2: I
- position 4: M
- E is in word but not at position 5, so E must be at position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ I E M _ (positions 2,3,4: I,E,M)

_ I E M _ with:

Valid English word: ""KIMEX"" – invalid
""VIMEK"" – invalid
""JIMEX"" – invalid

Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This suggests we might have missed something.

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints:
- Pattern: _ I M _ _ (positions 2 and 4 fixed: I, M)
- E must be in word (from feedback), and cannot be at position 5 (from LIMED feedback: E(-)), so E must be at position 3.

Thus the word must be: _ I E M _

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ I E M _:
- ""B I E M E"" – ""BIEME"" (invalid)
- ""F I E M E"" – ""FIEME"" (invalid)
- ""G I E M E"" – ""GIEME"" (invalid)
- ""K I E M E"" – ""KIEME"" (invalid)
- ""V I E M E"" – ""VIEME"" (invalid)

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's check the feedback again:
From LIMED:
- L(x) – L not in word
- I(✓) – I correct at position 2
- M(✓) – M correct at position 4
- E(-) – E in word but not at position 5
- D(x) – D not in word

Thus the word must be: _ I _ M _ (positions 2 and 4: I, M)
And E must be in position 1 or 3 or 5, but not 5 (from E(-)), so E in 1 or 3.

But position 4 is M, so:
Case 1: E at position 1: E I _ M _
Case 2: E at position 3: _ I E M _

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
Case 1: E I _ M _
Possible: E I G H T – but H is banned
E I G M A – ""EIGMA"" (invalid)
E I G M E – ""EIGME"" (invalid)

Case 2: _ I E M _
Possible: F I E M E – ""FIEME"" (invalid)
B I E M E – ""BIEME"" (invalid)

This seems problematic. Did I misinterpret the feedback?

Wait, let's re-express the feedback:
From LIMED:
- L(x) – L not in word
- I(✓) – I is correct and in position 2
- M(✓) – M is correct and in position 4
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3)
- D(x) – D not in word

But positions 2 and 4 are already I and M, so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
1. E I _ M _
2. _ I E M _

Looking for valid English words:
1. E I _ M _: EIGMA (invalid), EIGME (invalid), EIGHT (invalid – T banned), etc.
2. _ I E M _: FIEME (invalid), BIEME (invalid), KIEME (invalid)

This suggests the only possible word is ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This indicates I might have missed a word.

Wait, let's think of ""F I M E D"" – but D is banned
""F I M E R"" – R is banned

Actually, the word must be ""F I M E D"" but D is banned. This seems impossible.

But looking back at allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

For pattern _ I M E _:
Possible: B I M E ? – ""BIMEX"" (invalid)
F I M E ? – ""FIME?"" – nothing
G I M E ? – ""GIMEX"" (invalid)
J I M E ? – ""JIMEX"" (invalid)
K I M E ? – ""KIMEX"" (invalid)

This seems to be the only possible word, but it's invalid.

Realizing now that ""KIMEX"" is invalid, but ""FIMEX"" is also invalid.

This suggests the word must be ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This indicates I might have made an error.

Wait, let's check if ""FIMEX"" is a valid word – no, it's not.

This seems to be a dead end. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the word must be ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This suggests the only possible word is ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid.

Realizing I must have missed something, let me list all possible _ I M _ _ with E in word:
The word must contain E, and cannot have A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, W, P, L, D

Possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for _ I M _ _ with E:

- F I M E ? – ""FIME?"" – nothing
- G I M E ? – ""GIMEX"" (invalid)
- J I M E ? – ""JIMEX"" (invalid)
- K I M E ? – ""KIMEX"" (invalid)

This seems impossible. But ""KIMEX"" is actually a brand name, not a standard word.

Realizing this, I must have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

The word must be _ I M _ _ with E in 1 or 3, and M in 4.

Looking at valid English words:
- ""B I M E R"" – R banned
- ""F I M E R"" – R banned
- ""K I M E R"" – R banned
- ""G I M E R"" – R banned
- ""V I M E R"" – R banned

But ""VIMEY"" – ""VIMEY"" is a valid word (a variant spelling of ""vime"" or a surname).

Checking:
V: allowed
I: position 2 ✓
M: position 4 ✓
E: position 3 ✓
Y: allowed

This fits all constraints:
- Pattern: V I M E Y
- Contains E (position 3)
- M in position 4

- No banned letters

Thus, ""VIMEY"" is the correct guess.

Thus the word must be: _ I _ M _ (positions 2 and 4: I, M)
And E must be in position 1 or 3 or 5, but not 5 (from E(-)), so E in 1 or 3.

But position 4 is M, so:
Case 1: E at position 1: E I _ M _
Case 2: E at position 3: _ I E M _

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
Case 1: E I _ M _
Possible: E I G H T – but H is banned
E I G M A – ""EIGMA"" (invalid)
E I G M E – ""EIGME"" (invalid)

Case 2: _ I E M _
Possible: F I E M E – ""FIEME"" (invalid)
B I E M E – ""BIEME"" (invalid)

This seems problematic. Did I misinterpret the feedback?

Wait, let's re-express the feedback:
From LIMED:
- L(x) – L not in word
- I(✓) – I is correct and in position 2
- M(✓) – M is correct and in position 4
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3)
- D(x) – D not in word

But positions 2 and 4 are already I and M, so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Thus possible patterns:
1. E I _ M _
2. _ I E M _

Looking for valid English words:
1. E I _ M _: EIGMA (invalid), EIGME (invalid), EIGHT (invalid – T banned), etc.
2. _ I E M _: FIEME (invalid), BIEME (invalid), KIEME (invalid)

This suggests the only possible word is ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This indicates I might have missed a word.

Wait, let's think of ""F I M E D"" – but D is banned
""F I M E R"" – R is banned

Actually, the word must be ""F I M E D"" but D is banned. This seems impossible.

But looking back at allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

For pattern _ I M E _:
Possible: B I M E ? – ""BIMEX"" (invalid)
F I M E ? – ""FIME?"" – nothing
G I M E ? – ""GIMEX"" (invalid)
J I M E ? – ""JIMEX"" (invalid)
K I M E ? – ""KIMEX"" (invalid)

This seems to be the only possible word, but it's invalid.

Realizing now that ""KIMEX"" is invalid, but ""FIMEX"" is also invalid.

This suggests the word must be ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This indicates I might have made an error.

Wait, let's check if ""FIMEX"" is a valid word – no, it's not.

This seems to be a dead end. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the word must be ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid. This suggests the only possible word is ""KIMEX"" but it's invalid.

Realizing I must have missed something, let me list all possible _ I M _ _ with E in word:
The word must contain E, and cannot have A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, W, P, L, D

Possible letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for _ I M _ _ with E:
- B I M E ? – ""BIMEX"" (invalid)
- F I M E ? – ""FIME?"" – nothing
- G I M E ? – ""GIMEX"" (invalid)
- J I M E ? – ""JIMEX"" (invalid)
- K I M E ? – ""KIMEX"" (invalid)

This seems impossible. But ""KIMEX"" is actually a brand name, not a standard word.

Realizing this, I must have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

The word must be _ I M _ _ with E in 1 or 3, and M in 4.

Looking at valid English words:
- ""B I M E R"" – R banned
- ""F I M E R"" – R banned
- ""K I M E R"" – R banned
- ""G I M E R"" – R banned
- ""V I M E R"" – R banned

But ""VIMEY"" – ""VIMEY"" is a valid word (a variant spelling of ""vime"" or a surname).

Checking:
V: allowed
I: position 2 ✓
M: position 4 ✓
E: position 3 ✓
Y: allowed

This fits all constraints:
- Pattern: V I M E Y
- Contains E (position 3)
- M in position 4
- I in position 2
- No banned letters

Thus, ""VIMEY"" is the correct guess.",Guess 6: VIMEY -> FEEDBACK: V(x) I(✓) M(✓) E(-) Y(x),FAIL
