For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It includes two very common vowels (A, E)
2. It has three high-frequency consonants (S, L, T)
3. It tests the letter 'E' which is the most common in English
4. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains an S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good next-step strategy:
1. Keep the S but move it to a new position (positions 2-5).
2. Use high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

A strong candidate is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Another valid word that fits: “CHINS” – it places S in position 5, uses C, H, I, N which are untested, and avoids excluded letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Frequent consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
- Avoid repeating letters to test more unique characters

Some popular and effective starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because:
1. It includes two very common vowels (A, E)
2. It has three high-frequency consonants (S, L, T)
3. It tests the letter 'E' which is the most common in English
4. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains an S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good next-step strategy:
1. Keep the S but move it to a new position (positions 2-5).
2. Use high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

A strong candidate is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Another valid word that fits: “CHINS” – it places S in position 5, uses C, H, I, N which are untested, and avoids excluded letters.

Let’s go with CHINS.

From the two rounds we know:

1. S is in the word and is now confirmed to be in the 5th position (from CHINS feedback: S(✓)).
2. Letters L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N are NOT in the word at all.
3. Remaining unused common letters include: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since S is locked in position 5, we need a 4-letter combination using only the allowed letters (no L,A,T,E,C,H,I,N). We want to test as many new common letters as possible in one go.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Ends with S
- Uses four new letters from the remaining pool
- Uses high-frequency letters to maximize information gain

Looking at remaining high-frequency letters: R, O, U, D, G, M, B, K, P

Candidate words:
- ROUDS – but ""rouds"" isn't a common word
- GROUS – ""grouds"" isn't valid
- BURDS – ""burds"" isn't valid
- MURDS – ""murds"" isn't valid
- PROUDS – too long
- ROUND – ends with D, but we need S in 5th
- BURKS – ends with S, uses B,U,R,K (all new)
- GURKS – ends with S, uses G,U,R,K (all new)

""GURKS"" seems valid and uses four new letters (G,U,R,K) in positions 1-4, ending with confirmed S.

3. It tests the letter 'E' which is the most common in English
4. The letters are all distinct, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about which common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1)
- L, A, T, E are all NOT in the word at all

So we know:
- The word contains an S somewhere other than the first letter.
- The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good next-step strategy:
1. Keep the S but move it to a new position (positions 2-5).
2. Use high-frequency consonants and vowels we haven’t tried yet (R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoid any of L, A, T, E.

A strong candidate is “SHRIN” (but that’s not a valid word).  
Another valid word that fits: “CHINS” – it places S in position 5, uses C, H, I, N which are untested, and avoids excluded letters.

Let’s go with CHINS.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) N(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds we know:

1. S is in the word and is now confirmed to be in the 5th position (from CHINS feedback: S(✓)).
2. Letters L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N are NOT in the word at all.
3. Remaining unused common letters include: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since S is locked in position 5, we need a 4-letter combination using only the allowed letters (no L,A,T,E,C,H,I,N). We want to test as many new common letters as possible in one go.

A good strategy is to pick a word that:
- Ends with S
- Uses four new letters from the remaining pool
- Uses high-frequency letters to maximize information gain

Looking at remaining high-frequency letters: R, O, U, D, G, M, B, K, P

Candidate words:
- ROUDS – but ""rouds"" isn't a common word
- GROUS – ""grouds"" isn't valid
- BURDS – ""burds"" isn't valid
- MURDS – ""murds"" isn't valid
- PROUDS – too long
- ROUND – ends with D, but we need S in 5th
- BURKS – ends with S, uses B,U,R,K (all new)
- GURKS – ends with S, uses G,U,R,K (all new)

""GURKS"" seems valid and uses four new letters (G,U,R,K) in positions 1-4, ending with confirmed S.

Let's go with GURKS.

Guess 3: GURKS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) R(✓) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds we now know:

1. S is in the 5th position (confirmed by CHINS and GURKS).
2. U is in the word, but NOT in the 2nd position (from GURKS feedback).
3. R is in the word, but NOT in the 3rd position (from GURKS feedback).
4. Letters definitely OUT: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N, G, K.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
with U and R somewhere in positions 1-4, and no repeats of any excluded letters.

Remaining candidate letters (alphabet minus excluded ones):  
B, D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U and R.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in S, containing both U and R (each only once), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for U and R:
- U can be 1st, 3rd, or 4th (not 2nd or 5th)
- R can be 1st, 2nd, or 4th (not 3rd or 5th)

Let’s list valid words ending in S that fit:
- BURPS – contains B,U,R,P,S → all letters allowed
- DURPS – D,U,R,P,S → allowed
- MURPS – M,U,R,P,S → allowed
- FURPS – F,U,R,P,S → allowed
- JURPS – J,U,R,P,S → allowed
- VURPS – V,U,R,P,S → allowed

Among these, “BURPS” is a common word and uses three new letters (B, P). Let’s try it.

From the four guesses we now have:

2. U is locked in position 2.
3. R is locked in position 3.
4. B is locked in position 1.
5. P is NOT in the word (from BURPS feedback: P(x)).

So the pattern is: B U R _ S

The only missing letter is in position 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
All letters except: L, A, T, E, C, H, I, N, G, K, P.

Remaining common letters: D, F, J, M, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching B U R _ S.

Possible candidates:
- BURDS – valid word
- BURKS – K is out
- BURMS – not common
- BURRS – double R, but R already used once
- BURDS is the only common word left.

Let's go with BURDS.
