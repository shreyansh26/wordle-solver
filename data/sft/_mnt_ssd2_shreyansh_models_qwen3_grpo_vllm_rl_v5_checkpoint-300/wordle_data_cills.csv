### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
- No repeating letters
- Covers a good range of letter positions

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

A strong next guess would be ""SLUMP"":

- L, U, M, P are all new letters not tested before.
- Covers S, plus common consonants L, M, P and vowel U.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

Let’s update what we now know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are out.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (it appeared in positions 1 and 3 with “-” and in position 4 with the first AROSE).

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – U, M, P are out.  
   – S is not in position 1 (confirmed above).  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. LISTS → L(-) I(✓) S(-) T(x) S(✓)  
   – T is out.  
   – I is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S appears twice: one “-” and one “✓”.  
     – The S in position 5 is correct (✓).  
     – The S in position 3 is wrong (it must be elsewhere).  
     – Therefore S must be in position 5 only, because positions 1,3,4 are already ruled out.  
     – So the word has exactly one S, at position 5.

So the secret word:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Has S in position 5.  
- Has L somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T.  

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a pattern: _ I _ _ S with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Possible combinations:
- _ I L _ S  
- _ I _ L S  

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ L S.  
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y.

A common word that fits is “WIFLS” – but that’s not valid.  
“HILLS” – but L is repeated and we don’t know if L appears once or more.  
“FILMS” – M is out.  
“DILLS” – same issue.  
“NILLS” – N, I, L, L, S: valid word, uses N and L.  
“NILLS” fits: N I L L S.  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- S in position 5 ✓  
- L appears in positions 3 and 4 (but we only know one L is required; duplicate L is allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

So “NILLS” is a strong candidate.

Alternative: “CILIS” – but C, I, L, I, S: I repeats, but we don’t know if I appears more than once.  
“GILTS” – T is out.  
“DILLS” – D, I, L, L, S: also valid.  

Between “NILLS” and “DILLS”, both are equally valid. I’ll choose “NILLS”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
- No repeating letters
- Covers a good range of letter positions

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (sometimes).

A strong next guess would be ""SLUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible).
- L, U, M, P are all new letters not tested before.
- Covers S, plus common consonants L, M, P and vowel U.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – U, M, P are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.

So the secret word:
- Must contain S and L.  
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, U, M, P.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- L cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (only one left).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and L.  
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, U, M, P).  
- S not in 1 or 4.  
- L not in 2.

Candidate letters: S, L, I, T, N, C, D, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Possible word: “LISTS”  
- Contains S and L.  
- S in position 5 (allowed).  
- L in position 1 (allowed).  
- I, T are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

Another option: “SLINT” (but not a valid word).  
“LISTS” is valid and fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess LISTS.

   – A, R, O, E are out.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (it appeared in positions 1 and 3 with “-” and in position 4 with the first AROSE).

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – U, M, P are out.  
   – S is not in position 1 (confirmed above).  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. LISTS → L(-) I(✓) S(-) T(x) S(✓)  
   – T is out.  
   – I is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S appears twice: one “-” and one “✓”.  
     – The S in position 5 is correct (✓).  
     – The S in position 3 is wrong (it must be elsewhere).  
     – Therefore S must be in position 5 only, because positions 1,3,4 are already ruled out.  
     – So the word has exactly one S, at position 5.

So the secret word:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Has S in position 5.  
- Has L somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T.  

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a pattern: _ I _ _ S with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Possible combinations:
- _ I L _ S  
- _ I _ L S  

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ L S.  
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y.

A common word that fits is “WIFLS” – but that’s not valid.  
“HILLS” – but L is repeated and we don’t know if L appears once or more.  
“FILMS” – M is out.  
“DILLS” – same issue.  
“NILLS” – N, I, L, L, S: valid word, uses N and L.  
“NILLS” fits: N I L L S.  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- S in position 5 ✓  
- L appears in positions 3 and 4 (but we only know one L is required; duplicate L is allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

So “NILLS” is a strong candidate.

Alternative: “CILIS” – but C, I, L, I, S: I repeats, but we don’t know if I appears more than once.  
“GILTS” – T is out.  
“DILLS” – D, I, L, L, S: also valid.  

Between “NILLS” and “DILLS”, both are equally valid. I’ll choose “NILLS”.

Remaining possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ""ILLS"", the most common is ""WILLS"" (but we don't know if W is allowed yet). Other possibilities include ""FILLS"", ""DILLS"", ""GILLS"", etc.

All of these fit the pattern _ I L L S and use only allowed letters. Since we have only one guess left, we can choose any of these. I'll go with ""FILLS"" as it's a common word and F hasn't been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
- No repeating letters
- Covers a good range of letter positions

This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (sometimes).

A strong next guess would be ""SLUMP"":
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so possible).
- L, U, M, P are all new letters not tested before.
- Covers S, plus common consonants L, M, P and vowel U.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

Guess 2: SLUMP -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – U, M, P are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.

So the secret word:
- Must contain S and L.  
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, E, U, M, P.  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
- L cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, D, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I (only one left).

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S and L.  
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, U, M, P).  
- S not in 1 or 4.  
- L not in 2.

Candidate letters: S, L, I, T, N, C, D, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Possible word: “LISTS”  
- Contains S and L.  
- S in position 5 (allowed).  
- L in position 1 (allowed).  
- I, T are new letters.  
- No forbidden letters.

Another option: “SLINT” (but not a valid word).  
“LISTS” is valid and fits all constraints.

So I’ll guess LISTS.

Let’s update what we now know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are out.  
   – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (it appeared in positions 1 and 3 with “-” and in position 4 with the first AROSE).

2. SLUMP → S(-) L(-) U(x) M(x) P(x)  
   – U, M, P are out.  
   – S is not in position 1 (confirmed above).  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

3. LISTS → L(-) I(✓) S(-) T(x) S(✓)  
   – T is out.  
   – I is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – S appears twice: one “-” and one “✓”.  
     – The S in position 5 is correct (✓).  
     – The S in position 3 is wrong (it must be elsewhere).  
     – Therefore S must be in position 5 only, because positions 1,3,4 are already ruled out.  
     – So the word has exactly one S, at position 5.

So the secret word:
- Has I in position 2.  
- Has S in position 5.  
- Has L somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 2.  
- Cannot contain A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T.  

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a pattern: _ I _ _ S with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Possible combinations:
- _ I L _ S  
- _ I _ L S  

Let’s pick a word that fits _ I _ L S.  
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y.

A common word that fits is “WIFLS” – but that’s not valid.  
“HILLS” – but L is repeated and we don’t know if L appears once or more.  
“FILMS” – M is out.  
“DILLS” – same issue.  
“NILLS” – N, I, L, L, S: valid word, uses N and L.  
“NILLS” fits: N I L L S.  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- S in position 5 ✓  
- L appears in positions 3 and 4 (but we only know one L is required; duplicate L is allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  

So “NILLS” is a strong candidate.

Alternative: “CILIS” – but C, I, L, I, S: I repeats, but we don’t know if I appears more than once.  
“GILTS” – T is out.  
“DILLS” – D, I, L, L, S: also valid.  

Between “NILLS” and “DILLS”, both are equally valid. I’ll choose “NILLS”.

From the latest feedback on NILLS:

N(x) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓) S(✓)

This tells us:

- I is in position 2 (already known) and is correct.
- L is in position 3 and is correct.
- L is in position 4 and is correct.
- S is in position 5 and is correct.
- N is not in the word.

So the secret word is now fully determined: _ I L L S.

We just need to find the first letter. The only remaining constraint is that the first letter must not be any of the letters already ruled out: A, R, O, E, U, M, P, T, N.

Remaining possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, V, W, Y.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in ""ILLS"", the most common is ""WILLS"" (but we don't know if W is allowed yet). Other possibilities include ""FILLS"", ""DILLS"", ""GILLS"", etc.

All of these fit the pattern _ I L L S and use only allowed letters. Since we have only one guess left, we can choose any of these. I'll go with ""FILLS"" as it's a common word and F hasn't been tested yet.
