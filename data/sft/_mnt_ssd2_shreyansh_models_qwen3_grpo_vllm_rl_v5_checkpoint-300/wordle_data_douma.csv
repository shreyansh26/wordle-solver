For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible candidates:
- ALOUT (but has U and T, which are untested)
- ALOUD (but has U and D, which are untested)
- ANGEL (but has N, G, L - but E is excluded)
- AFOOT (but has F, T - and O is in position 3 which is invalid)
- AGLOW (but has G, L, W - and O is in position 3 which is invalid)

A better approach is to look for words with A and O in different positions, avoiding R/S/E. Let's try ""ADORN"" - but it has N and R (R is excluded). 

Next option: ""ABOUT"" - has B, U, T. This seems good:
- A is in position 1 (but feedback says A is not in position 1) - so invalid.

Another option: ""COBIA"" - but has C, B, I. This has A in position 5 and O in position 2. This seems valid:
- Contains A and O.
- Does not contain R, S, or E.
- A is in position 5 (not 1), O is in position 2 (not 3).

Let me check ""COBIA"" - it's a valid 5-letter word (though uncommon, it's a type of fish). If this isn't acceptable, I can try ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded. 

A more common word: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded. 

Next: ""COBIA"" seems the best available. Alternatively, ""AMONG"" - but has N, G, M, and O in position 2 (valid), A in position 1 (invalid). 

Another candidate: ""CLOAK"" - has C, L, T, K. A is in position 4, O in position 2. This seems valid:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, C, L, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, O  

Specific positional information:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from CLOAK).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from CLOAK), so O is definitely not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains both A and O exactly once each.
- Does not contain R, S, E, C, L, K.
- A is in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed present).

A good next guess should:
1. Place A and O in new positions.
2. Introduce several new, still-allowed consonants and possibly a vowel.
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

Candidate words:
- BLOAT – uses B, L (but L is excluded), so invalid.
- MOCHA – uses M, O, C (excluded), H, A – invalid.
- DOGMA – uses D, O, G, M, A – all letters allowed, and positions for A and O are new.
- FOGAY – uses F, O, G, A, Y – all allowed, positions for A and O are new.
- HOARD – uses H, O, A, R (excluded), D – invalid.

Between DOGMA and FOGAY, DOGMA introduces D, G, M (all new and allowed) and places A in position 3 and O in position 2, satisfying the positional constraints.

So I’ll guess DOGMA.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and O.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible candidates:
- ALOUT (but has U and T, which are untested)
- ALOUD (but has U and D, which are untested)
- ANGEL (but has N, G, L - but E is excluded)
- AFOOT (but has F, T - and O is in position 3 which is invalid)
- AGLOW (but has G, L, W - and O is in position 3 which is invalid)

A better approach is to look for words with A and O in different positions, avoiding R/S/E. Let's try ""ADORN"" - but it has N and R (R is excluded). 

Next option: ""ABOUT"" - has B, U, T. This seems good:
- A is in position 1 (but feedback says A is not in position 1) - so invalid.

Another option: ""COBIA"" - but has C, B, I. This has A in position 5 and O in position 2. This seems valid:
- Contains A and O.
- Does not contain R, S, or E.
- A is in position 5 (not 1), O is in position 2 (not 3).

Let me check ""COBIA"" - it's a valid 5-letter word (though uncommon, it's a type of fish). If this isn't acceptable, I can try ""COBRA"" - but R is excluded. 

A more common word: ""COAST"" - but S is excluded. 

Next: ""COBIA"" seems the best available. Alternatively, ""AMONG"" - but has N, G, M, and O in position 2 (valid), A in position 1 (invalid). 

Another candidate: ""CLOAK"" - has C, L, T, K. A is in position 4, O in position 2. This seems valid:
- Contains A and O.
- No R, S, E.
- A not in position 1, O not in position 3.

""CLOAK"" is a common word and fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CLOAK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(x) O(-) A(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, S, E, C, L, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, O  

Specific positional information:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (from AROSE) and not in position 4 (from CLOAK).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 again (from CLOAK), so O is definitely not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains both A and O exactly once each.
- Does not contain R, S, E, C, L, K.
- A is in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- O is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed present).

A good next guess should:
1. Place A and O in new positions.
2. Introduce several new, still-allowed consonants and possibly a vowel.
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

Candidate words:
- BLOAT – uses B, L (but L is excluded), so invalid.
- MOCHA – uses M, O, C (excluded), H, A – invalid.
- DOGMA – uses D, O, G, M, A – all letters allowed, and positions for A and O are new.
- FOGAY – uses F, O, G, A, Y – all allowed, positions for A and O are new.
- HOARD – uses H, O, A, R (excluded), D – invalid.

Between DOGMA and FOGAY, DOGMA introduces D, G, M (all new and allowed) and places A in position 3 and O in position 2, satisfying the positional constraints.

So I’ll guess DOGMA.

From the feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word and their exact positions:
- D is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- M is in position 4 (✓)
- A is in position 5 (✓)

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, C, L, K, G.

So the pattern so far is: D O _ M A

The blank (position 3) must be a letter that:
- Has not been ruled out (not in {R,S,E,C,L,K,G})
- Has not yet been confirmed (not A, D, O, M)

Remaining possible letters for position 3 (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out set): B, F, H, I, J, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit D O _ M A:
- DOBMA – not a valid word
- DOFMA – not a valid word
- DOHMA – not a valid word
- DOIMA – not a valid word
- DONMA – not a valid word
- DOPMA – not a valid word
- DOTMA – not a valid word
- DOUMA – not a valid word
- DOVMA – not a valid word
- LOW – no common word fits

However, ""DOUMA"" is actually a valid word (an Arabic tribe), but it's uncommon. The more common word is ""DOUMA"" (variant spelling of ""Duma""), but let's check standard dictionaries.

A more common word fitting this pattern is ""DOUMA"" (as in the Duma). Since this is the only valid word left that fits the pattern, this must be the answer.
