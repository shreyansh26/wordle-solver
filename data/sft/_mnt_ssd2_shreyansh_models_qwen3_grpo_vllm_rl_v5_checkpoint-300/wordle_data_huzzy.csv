1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it uses common letters and covers different vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel and 'R' is a very common consonant. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word, so we can eliminate any word containing any of those letters.

Next, I want a word that uses completely different letters. Looking at the remaining common letters, the next best candidates are: T, I, N, U, L, C, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

A good second guess that avoids A, R, O, S, E and still uses common letters is ""UNITY"". It contains U, N, I, T, Y - none of which were in AROSE.

Another strong option is ""CHILD"" (C, H, I, L, D) or ""BLUNT"" (B, L, U, N, T). 

I'll choose ""UNITY"" because it covers several common vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, Y) that haven't been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains 5 unique common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many English words. This gives me maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it uses common letters and covers different vowels and consonants. However, ""AROSE"" seems slightly better because 'O' is a common vowel and 'R' is a very common consonant. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word, so we can eliminate any word containing any of those letters.

Next, I want a word that uses completely different letters. Looking at the remaining common letters, the next best candidates are: T, I, N, U, L, C, Y, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

A good second guess that avoids A, R, O, S, E and still uses common letters is ""UNITY"". It contains U, N, I, T, Y - none of which were in AROSE.

Another strong option is ""CHILD"" (C, H, I, L, D) or ""BLUNT"" (B, L, U, N, T). 

I'll choose ""UNITY"" because it covers several common vowels (U, I) and consonants (N, T, Y) that haven't been tested yet.

From the feedback so far:

- A, R, O, S, E, N, I, T are NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at the end.

So the secret word ends with Y and contains U somewhere, but not in position 1. The remaining letters to consider are from the unused pool: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

I want a word that:
1. Ends with Y.
2. Contains U but not in position 1.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- BLUDY (but D is unused, L and B are unused, U is in position 3)
- CHUMPY (but P is unused, but this is 6 letters)
- FLUNKY (F, L, N, K - but N is eliminated)
- GLUMPY (G, L, U, M, P - but P is unused, and ends with Y)
- PLUNKY (P, L, U, N, K - but N is eliminated)
- SLUMPY (S is eliminated)
- TRULY (T is eliminated)
- BULKY (B, U, L, K - but ends with Y and has U in position 2)

""BULKY"" fits:
- Ends with Y (✓)
- Contains U in position 2 (not position 1, so satisfies the - feedback)
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (B, U, L, K are all new)
