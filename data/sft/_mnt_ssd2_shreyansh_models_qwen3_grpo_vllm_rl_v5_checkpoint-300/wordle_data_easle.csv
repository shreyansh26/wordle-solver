### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, as this helps eliminate or confirm multiple letters at once.

Looking at these common letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a strong foundation to interpret the feedback and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

2. CHASE → C(x) H(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓)
3. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)

What we know for certain:
- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters A, S, and L.
- It does NOT contain R, O, C, H, T.
- Positions so far:
  – Position 1: NOT S (from SLATE), NOT A (from CHASE), NOT R (from AROSE), etc. – but we still don’t know what it IS.
  – Position 2: NOT L (from SLATE), NOT A (from CHASE), NOT E (from SLATE), etc.

  – Position 4: NOT A (from CHASE), NOT L (from SLATE), NOT S (from SLATE), NOT T (from SLATE), etc.

Let’s tabulate the possible letters for each slot, excluding the known absent letters (R, O, C, H, T).

Known letters still in play: A, S, L, plus the remaining common consonants (B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

We need a word that:
- ends in E
- uses A, S, L exactly once each
- uses two other distinct letters from the remaining pool
- has no repeats.

A promising pattern is S _ _ A L _ _ _ E, but that would be 7 letters. We need to fit A, S, L into positions 1-4 without repeating.

Let’s try S in position 3 (since it can’t be 2 or 4 from earlier), A in position 2, and L in position 4. That gives us: _ A S L E – but that’s only 5 letters: ? A S L E.

The first letter must be one we haven’t ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Wait, let’s try a different arrangement.

How about S in position 1, A in position 2, L in position 3: S A L _ E.

The fourth letter must be new. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, as this helps eliminate or confirm multiple letters at once.

Looking at these common letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a strong foundation to interpret the feedback and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses A and S in other positions. Good letters to try next are common ones like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A word like ""STEAK"" comes to mind, but it has an A in position 4, which is not allowed (since S was in position 4 and marked wrong). 

Another candidate: ""SLATE"" - but this has an A in position 4 again.

""CHASE"" - has C, H, A, S, E. A is in position 3, S in position 2. This seems valid:
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains A and S in new positions
- Doesn't use R or O

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters A and S, but:
   - A is NOT in position 1 or 3.
   - S is NOT in position 2 or 4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, C, or H.

Available positions for A: 2 or 4  
Available positions for S: 1 or 3  

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- uses A and S in the remaining positions
- avoids R, O, C, H

A quick scan of common patterns:
- If S is in position 1, A could be in 2 or 4.
- If S is in position 3, A could be in 2 or 4.

Candidate words:
- SLATE: A in 4, S in 1 → fits all constraints
- SNARE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- SPARE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- STANE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- SLAID: ends in D → invalid
- SLAIN: ends in N → invalid
- SLAKE: ends in E, A in 4, S in 1 → fits

""SLATE"" and ""SLAKE"" both fit, but ""SLATE"" is more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, as this helps eliminate or confirm multiple letters at once.

Looking at these common letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a strong foundation to interpret the feedback and narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that uses A and S in other positions. Good letters to try next are common ones like T, L, N, I, C, etc.

A word like ""STEAK"" comes to mind, but it has an A in position 4, which is not allowed (since S was in position 4 and marked wrong). 

Another candidate: ""SLATE"" - but this has an A in position 4 again.

""CHASE"" - has C, H, A, S, E. A is in position 3, S in position 2. This seems valid:
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains A and S in new positions
- Doesn't use R or O

Guess 2: CHASE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends in E (position 5).
2. It contains the letters A and S, but:
   - A is NOT in position 1 or 3.
   - S is NOT in position 2 or 4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, C, or H.

Available positions for A: 2 or 4  
Available positions for S: 1 or 3  

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- ends in E
- uses A and S in the remaining positions
- avoids R, O, C, H

A quick scan of common patterns:
- If S is in position 1, A could be in 2 or 4.
- If S is in position 3, A could be in 2 or 4.

Candidate words:
- SLATE: A in 4, S in 1 → fits all constraints
- SNARE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- SPARE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- STANE: A in 3 (invalid), S in 1 → invalid
- SLAID: ends in D → invalid
- SLAIN: ends in N → invalid
- SLAKE: ends in E, A in 4, S in 1 → fits

""SLATE"" and ""SLAKE"" both fit, but ""SLATE"" is more common.

From the three rounds we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
2. CHASE → C(x) H(x) A(-) S(-) E(✓)
3. SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)

What we know for certain:
- The word ends in E (position 5).
- It contains the letters A, S, and L.
- It does NOT contain R, O, C, H, T.
- Positions so far:
  – Position 1: NOT S (from SLATE), NOT A (from CHASE), NOT R (from AROSE), etc. – but we still don’t know what it IS.
  – Position 2: NOT L (from SLATE), NOT A (from CHASE), NOT E (from SLATE), etc.
  – Position 3: NOT A (from CHASE), NOT L (from SLATE), NOT S (from SLATE), etc.
  – Position 4: NOT A (from CHASE), NOT L (from SLATE), NOT S (from SLATE), NOT T (from SLATE), etc.

Let’s tabulate the possible letters for each slot, excluding the known absent letters (R, O, C, H, T).

Known letters still in play: A, S, L, plus the remaining common consonants (B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

We need a word that:
- ends in E
- uses A, S, L exactly once each
- uses two other distinct letters from the remaining pool
- has no repeats.

A promising pattern is S _ _ A L _ _ _ E, but that would be 7 letters. We need to fit A, S, L into positions 1-4 without repeating.

Let’s try S in position 3 (since it can’t be 2 or 4 from earlier), A in position 2, and L in position 4. That gives us: _ A S L E – but that’s only 5 letters: ? A S L E.

The first letter must be one we haven’t ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

Try “BASEL” – but that ends in L, not E. Not valid.

“WASLE” – not a real word.

“BASEL” – invalid.

“MASEL” – not common.

“PASLE” – not a word.

“FASLE” – not a word.

“GASLE” – not a word.

“VASLE” – not a word.

“DASLE” – not a word.

“KASLE” – not a word.

“YASLE” – not a word.

“BASLE” – not a word.

“NASEL” – not a word.

“LANSE” – but L is already used in position 4, and N is allowed.

Wait, let’s try a different arrangement.

How about S in position 1, A in position 2, L in position 3: S A L _ E.

The fourth letter must be new. Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y.

“SABLE” – real word, ends in E, uses S, A, L, and B is allowed.

Check constraints:
- Ends in E ✓
- Contains A, S, L ✓
- No R, O, C, H, T ✓
- Positions:
  – S in 1: allowed (only position 2 and 4 were ruled out for S)
  – A in 2: allowed (only positions 1,3,5 were ruled out for A)
  – L in 3: allowed (only positions 2,5 were ruled out for L)
  – B in 4: new letter, allowed
  – E in 5: correct ✓

“SABLE” fits all constraints.
