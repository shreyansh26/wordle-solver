For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S (but O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Does not have A, R, E
3. Has O not in position 3
4. Has S not in position 4

Good candidates often have common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Since we’ve eliminated A, R, E, common remaining consonants are T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “STONY”:
- S and O are present
- T, N, Y are new letters
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3)

But STONY might be too common. Another option is “SOUND”:
- S, O, U, N, D
- But U wasn’t tested yet, and we want to test more consonants.

“SPOON” has two O’s, which might waste a letter. “SLOTH” has S, O, L, T, H – all new letters except O and S.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” as it tests S, O, L, T, H – giving us info on 3 new consonants while keeping S and O.

But wait, O was in position 3 originally (AROSE), and in SLOTH O is in position 2 – that’s fine. S was in position 4 originally, and in SLOTH it’s in position 1 – also fine.

So my next guess is SLOTH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S (but O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Does not have A, R, E
3. Has O not in position 3
4. Has S not in position 4

Good candidates often have common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Since we’ve eliminated A, R, E, common remaining consonants are T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “STONY”:
- S and O are present
- T, N, Y are new letters
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3)

But STONY might be too common. Another option is “SOUND”:
- S, O, U, N, D
- But U wasn’t tested yet, and we want to test more consonants.

“SPOON” has two O’s, which might waste a letter. “SLOTH” has S, O, L, T, H – all new letters except O and S.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” as it tests S, O, L, T, H – giving us info on 3 new consonants while keeping S and O.

But wait, O was in position 3 originally (AROSE), and in SLOTH O is in position 2 – that’s fine. S was in position 4 originally, and in SLOTH it’s in position 1 – also fine.

So my next guess is SLOTH.

""FUSCO"", ""JUSCO"", ""MUSCO"", ""VUSCO"" are all valid. ""FUSCO"" is a common enough word.

Let's verify:
- F, U, S, C, O – none are in the eliminated list.
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both S and O

Let's summarize the information we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N, F, C

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (--feedback):
O, S, U

Positions ruled out:
- O: cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from AROSE, SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – The only remaining position for O is 1.
- S: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.
- U: cannot be in position 2 (from FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for U: 3, 4, or 5.

So the word must:
1. Start with O (position 1).
2. Contain both S and U in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, with:
   – S not in 1,3,4 → S must be in 2 or 5.
   – U not in 2 → U must be in 3,4, or 5.
3. Use only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the required O, S, U).

Possible patterns:
- O S _ _ _  (but then where does U go?)
- O _ S _ _  (S in 3 is invalid)
- O _ _ S _  (S in 4 is invalid)
- O _ _ _ S  (S in 5 is allowed)
- O _ U _ _  (U in 3 is allowed)
- O _ _ U _  (U in 4 is allowed)
- O _ _ _ U  (U in 5 is allowed)

The only valid pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
O _ _ _ S  (S in 5) with U placed in positions 3 or 4.

So the word structure is: O _ U _ S or O _ _ U S.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- O _ U _ S:  ""OBUYS"" – but B and Y are allowed, but ""OBUYS"" is not a common word.
- O _ _ U S:  ""ODUFS"" – not valid.
- ""OGLES"" – but L is eliminated.
- ""OVENS"" – N is eliminated.
- ""OUSTS"" – T is eliminated.
- ""OWLS"" – too short.
- ""OXYS"" – too short.
- ""OBUYS"" – seems the closest fit, but let's check another angle.

Wait, let's list possible combinations:
Letters: O, S, U plus two from remaining: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters. Let's try common consonants.

Possible words:
- O B U S _ – but S must be last.
- O B U S _ – need a 5th letter, but S is already 5th.
- O B U S _ – no.
- O B _ U S – ""OBUYS"" – yes, but Y is allowed.

Is ""OBUYS"" a valid word? It means to buy, but it's uncommon. Let's think of others.

- O D U S _ – ""ODUS"" – no.
- O G U S _ – ""OGUS"" – no.
- O M U S _ – ""OMUS"" – no.
- O V U S _ – ""OVUS"" – no.

Alternative: maybe ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Another pattern: O _ U S _ – but S must be last (position 5), so this is same as above.

Actually, the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O B U _ S – ""OBUYS"" (Y is allowed)
- O D U _ S – ""ODUYS"" – no.
- O G U _ S – ""OGUYS"" – no.
- O M U _ S – ""OMUYS"" – no.
- O V U _ S – ""OVUYS"" – no.

Another approach: maybe the word has another letter that is allowed.

Wait, let's list all possible combinations systematically.

We have O _ _ _ S and must include U somewhere in positions 2,3,4.

So possible positions for U:
- Position 2: O U _ _ S – but U cannot be in position 2 (from FUSCO feedback). So invalid.
- Position 3: O _ U _ S – valid.
- Position 4: O _ _ U S – valid.

So we need:
1. O _ U _ S
2. O _ _ U S

Let's find valid words:

1. O _ U _ S:
   - O B U S _ – no 5th letter.
   - O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last.
   - Actually, this would be O B U S _ – but we need 5 letters total, so O B U S _ is 4 letters. We need one more letter, but S is already last. This seems impossible.

Wait, the word must be exactly 5 letters with O in 1, S in 5, and U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O _ U _ S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:S
- O _ _ U S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:U, 5:S

Let's find valid words:

For O _ U _ S:
- O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last. So O B U S _ is 4 letters. Not possible.
- Actually, the word is O _ U _ S, so positions 2 and 4 need letters. So possible:
  - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
  - O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
  - O B U G S – ""OBUGS"" – not a word.
  - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
  - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.

For O _ _ U S:
- O B D U S – ""OBDUS"" – no.
- O B G U S – ""OBGUS"" – no.
- O B M U S – ""OBMUS"" – no.
- O B V U S – ""OBVUS"" – no.
- O D M U S – ""ODMUS"" – no.
- O G M U S – ""OGMUS"" – no.
- O M B U S – ""OMBUS"" – no.
- O M D U S – ""OMDUS"" – no.
- O M G U S – ""OMGUS"" – no.
- O M V U S – ""OMVUS"" – no.
- O V M U S – ""OVMUS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, let's think differently: perhaps the word has another letter that is allowed.

Actually, the letters we have are O, S, U plus two from remaining: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with O, S, U and two others from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O B S U _ – but S must be last.
- O S U _ _ – but O must be first, S must be last, so O S U _ _ – but then where is U?
  - O S U _ _ – this would require U to be in position 3, but then we have O S U _ _ which is 4 letters. Not possible.

Another approach: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Wait, let's list all possible 5-letter words that contain O, S, U with the constraints.

Given:
- O must be in position 1
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- U must be in position 3,4, or 5
- No other letters from eliminated list.

Let's try:
- O S _ _ U – but then S is in position 2, U in 5. Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Possible: O S B D U – ""OSBDU"" – no.
  - O S B U _ – need 5th letter, but U is in 4, S in 2, O in 1. So O S _ U _ – need 3rd letter.
    - O S B U _ – ""OSBU_"" – no.
    - O S D U _ – ""OSDUX"" – no.
    - O S M U _ – ""OSMUD"" – no.
    - O S V U _ – ""OSVUD"" – no.

- O _ S _ U – but S cannot be in position 3 (from PISON feedback).

- O _ _ S U – but S cannot be in position 4 (from SLOTH feedback).

- O _ _ _ S – S in position 5, U must be in 3 or 4.
  - O _ U _ S – need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed.
    - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
    - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
    - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.
    - O M U B S – ""OMUBS"" – no.
    - O V U M S – ""OVUMS"" – no.
  - O _ _ U S – need 2nd and 3rd letters from allowed.
    - O B _ U S – ""OBUYS"" – this seems the closest, but Y is allowed.
      - ""OBUYS"" – is this a valid word? It means ""to buy"", but it's uncommon. However, it's listed in some dictionaries as an archaic form.
    - O D _ U S – ""ODUYS"" – no.
    - O G _ U S – ""OGUYS"" – no.
    - O M _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.
    - O V _ U S – ""OVUYS"" – no.

Given the constraints, ""OBUYS"" appears to be the only possible word that fits, even if it's uncommon. However, let's double-check if we missed any other words.

Alternative: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Another check: maybe ""OUSTS"" is invalid due to T, so next possible is ""OBUYS"".

But let's think of others:
- O _ U _ S – ""OJUYS"" – no.
- O _ _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.

After careful consideration, ""OBUYS"" seems to be the only possible word that fits all constraints, despite being uncommon.

However, upon reflection, I realize I might have missed a more common word. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the letters allowed are O, S, U plus two from: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O D U S _ – no.
- O G U S _ – no.
- O M U S _ – no.
- O V U S _ – no.

Actually, the correct structure is O _ _ _ S with U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
- O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
- O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
- O D U M S – ""ODUMS"" – yes! ""ODUMS"" is a valid word (plural of odum, a small tree or a unit of energy in ecology).

Let's verify ""ODUMS"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- D in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- M in position 4 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both S and U
- No letters from eliminated list
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out)
- U is in position 3 (not ruled out)

""ODUMS"" fits all constraints perfectly.

</think>

Given all constraints, the only remaining valid word is ""ODUMS"".

<guess>ODUMS</guess>",ODUMS,"Let's summarize the information we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N, F, C

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (--feedback):
O, S, U

Positions ruled out:
- O: cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from AROSE, SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – The only remaining position for O is 1.
- S: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.
- U: cannot be in position 2 (from FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for U: 3, 4, or 5.

So the word must:
1. Start with O (position 1).
2. Contain both S and U in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, with:
   – S not in 1,3,4 → S must be in 2 or 5.
   – U not in 2 → U must be in 3,4, or 5.
3. Use only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the required O, S, U).

Possible patterns:
- O S _ _ _  (but then where does U go?)
- O _ S _ _  (S in 3 is invalid)
- O _ _ S _  (S in 4 is invalid)
- O _ _ _ S  (S in 5 is allowed)
- O _ U _ _  (U in 3 is allowed)
- O _ _ U _  (U in 4 is allowed)
- O _ _ _ U  (U in 5 is allowed)

The only valid pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
O _ _ _ S  (S in 5) with U placed in positions 3 or 4.

So the word structure is: O _ U _ S or O _ _ U S.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- O _ U _ S:  ""OBUYS"" – but B and Y are allowed, but ""OBUYS"" is not a common word.
- O _ _ U S:  ""ODUFS"" – not valid.
- ""OGLES"" – but L is eliminated.
- ""OVENS"" – N is eliminated.
- ""OUSTS"" – T is eliminated.
- ""OWLS"" – too short.
- ""OXYS"" – too short.
- ""OBUYS"" – seems the closest fit, but let's check another angle.

We have O _ _ _ S and must include U somewhere in positions 2,3,4.

- Position 3: O _ U _ S – valid.
- Position 4: O _ _ U S – valid.

   - O B U S _ – no 5th letter.
   - O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last.
   - Actually, this would be O B U S _ – but we need 5 letters total, so O B U S _ is 4 letters. We need one more letter, but S is already last. This seems impossible.

Wait, the word must be exactly 5 letters with O in 1, S in 5, and U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O _ U _ S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:S
- O _ _ U S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:U, 5:S

Let's find valid words:

For O _ U _ S:
- O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last. So O B U S _ is 4 letters. Not possible.
- Actually, the word is O _ U _ S, so positions 2 and 4 need letters. So possible:
  - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
  - O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
  - O B U G S – ""OBUGS"" – not a word.
  - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
  - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.

For O _ _ U S:
- O B D U S – ""OBDUS"" – no.
- O B G U S – ""OBGUS"" – no.
- O B M U S – ""OBMUS"" – no.
- O B V U S – ""OBVUS"" – no.
- O D M U S – ""ODMUS"" – no.
- O G M U S – ""OGMUS"" – no.
- O M B U S – ""OMBUS"" – no.
- O M D U S – ""OMDUS"" – no.
- O M G U S – ""OMGUS"" – no.
- O M V U S – ""OMVUS"" – no.
- O V M U S – ""OVMUS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, let's think differently: perhaps the word has another letter that is allowed.

Actually, the letters we have are O, S, U plus two from remaining: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with O, S, U and two others from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O B S U _ – but S must be last.
- O S U _ _ – but O must be first, S must be last, so O S U _ _ – but then where is U?
  - O S U _ _ – this would require U to be in position 3, but then we have O S U _ _ which is 4 letters. Not possible.

Another approach: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Wait, let's list all possible 5-letter words that contain O, S, U with the constraints.

Given:
- O must be in position 1
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- U must be in position 3,4, or 5
- No other letters from eliminated list.

Let's try:
- O S _ _ U – but then S is in position 2, U in 5. Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Possible: O S B D U – ""OSBDU"" – no.
  - O S B U _ – need 5th letter, but U is in 4, S in 2, O in 1. So O S _ U _ – need 3rd letter.
    - O S B U _ – ""OSBU_"" – no.
    - O S D U _ – ""OSDUX"" – no.
    - O S M U _ – ""OSMUD"" – no.
    - O S V U _ – ""OSVUD"" – no.

- O _ S _ U – but S cannot be in position 3 (from PISON feedback).

- O _ _ S U – but S cannot be in position 4 (from SLOTH feedback).

- O _ _ _ S – S in position 5, U must be in 3 or 4.
  - O _ U _ S – need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed.
    - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
    - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
    - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.
    - O M U B S – ""OMUBS"" – no.
    - O V U M S – ""OVUMS"" – no.
  - O _ _ U S – need 2nd and 3rd letters from allowed.
    - O B _ U S – ""OBUYS"" – this seems the closest, but Y is allowed.
      - ""OBUYS"" – is this a valid word? It means ""to buy"", but it's uncommon. However, it's listed in some dictionaries as an archaic form.
    - O D _ U S – ""ODUYS"" – no.
    - O G _ U S – ""OGUYS"" – no.
    - O M _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.
    - O V _ U S – ""OVUYS"" – no.

Given the constraints, ""OBUYS"" appears to be the only possible word that fits, even if it's uncommon. However, let's double-check if we missed any other words.

Alternative: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Another check: maybe ""OUSTS"" is invalid due to T, so next possible is ""OBUYS"".

But let's think of others:
- O _ U _ S – ""OJUYS"" – no.
- O _ _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.

After careful consideration, ""OBUYS"" seems to be the only possible word that fits all constraints, despite being uncommon.

However, upon reflection, I realize I might have missed a more common word. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the letters allowed are O, S, U plus two from: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O D U S _ – no.
- O G U S _ – no.
- O M U S _ – no.
- O V U S _ – no.

Actually, the correct structure is O _ _ _ S with U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
- O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
- O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
- O D U M S – ""ODUMS"" – yes! ""ODUMS"" is a valid word (plural of odum, a small tree or a unit of energy in ecology).

Let's verify ""ODUMS"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- D in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- M in position 4 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both S and U
- No letters from eliminated list
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out)
- U is in position 3 (not ruled out)

""ODUMS"" fits all constraints perfectly.Given all constraints, the only remaining valid word is ""ODUMS"".",Guess 5: ODUMS -> FEEDBACK: O(-) D(x) U(-) M(x) S(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify which vowels are in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x)
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S (but O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4)
- Does NOT contain A, R, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both O and S
2. Does not have A, R, E
3. Has O not in position 3
4. Has S not in position 4

Good candidates often have common consonants like T, N, L, D, etc. Since we’ve eliminated A, R, E, common remaining consonants are T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word like “STONY”:
- S and O are present
- T, N, Y are new letters
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since original S was in position 4)
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since original O was in position 3)

But STONY might be too common. Another option is “SOUND”:
- S, O, U, N, D
- But U wasn’t tested yet, and we want to test more consonants.

“SPOON” has two O’s, which might waste a letter. “SLOTH” has S, O, L, T, H – all new letters except O and S.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” as it tests S, O, L, T, H – giving us info on 3 new consonants while keeping S and O.

But wait, O was in position 3 originally (AROSE), and in SLOTH O is in position 2 – that’s fine. S was in position 4 originally, and in SLOTH it’s in position 1 – also fine.

So my next guess is SLOTH.

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: O, S

2. SLOTH → S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
   - Letters not in the word: L, T, H
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, O

Combining these:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H
- Letters confirmed IN the word: O, S
- Current constraints:
  – The word must contain both O and S.
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (it was in position 3 in AROSE and position 2 in SLOTH).
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (it was in position 4 in AROSE and position 1 in SLOTH).

Remaining common letters to test: N, D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
  – Contains O and S.
  – Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5 (since 2,3 are ruled out).
  – Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
  – Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- SONIC: S(1), O(2) – but O cannot be in position 2.
- CODYS: C, O(2), D, Y, S(5) – but O cannot be in position 2.
- MOPSY: M, O(2), P, S(4), Y – again O in position 2 is invalid.
- NODOS: N, O(2), D, O(4), S(5) – O in position 2 invalid.
- SCOOP: S(1), C, O(2), O(3), P – O in positions 2,3 invalid.
- PISON: P, I, S(3), O(4), N – O in position 4 is allowed (not ruled out yet), S in position 3 is allowed.
  – Letters: P, I, S, O, N – none are in the eliminated list.
  – S is in position 3 (allowed), O is in position 4 (allowed).

PISON looks valid and fits all constraints.

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

   – Letters in word but wrong place: O, S

2. SLOTH → S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)

   – Additional letters not in word: P, I, N
   – Confirmed letters still in word: O, S (position 3 ruled out for S; position 4 ruled out for O)

Summary of constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N
- Letters confirmed IN the word: O, S
- Positions ruled out:
  – O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4
  – S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4

Therefore:
- O must be in position 1 or 5
- S must be in position 2 or 5

Also, remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
  – Contains both O and S
  – O in position 1 or 5
  – S in position 2 or 5
  – Uses only letters not yet eliminated

Possible patterns:
1. O _ _ _ S
2. O _ _ S _
3. _ _ _ O S
4. _ _ O _ S  (but O cannot be in position 3)
5. _ _ S _ O  (but S cannot be in position 3)
6. S _ _ _ O  (S in position 1 is invalid)
7. _ S _ _ O  (S in position 2 is valid, O in position 5 is valid)

Valid patterns:
- O _ _ _ S
- O _ _ S _
- _ S _ _ O
- _ _ _ O S  (but S cannot be in position 5 if O is in position 4, since O cannot be in position 4)

Actually, O cannot be in position 4 (from PISON feedback), so:
- _ _ _ O S is invalid because O would be in position 4.

Similarly, S cannot be in position 5 (from PISON feedback), so:
- O _ _ _ S is invalid because S would be in position 5.

Therefore valid patterns:
- O _ _ S _  (O in position 1, S in position 4) – but S cannot be in position 4 (from SLOTH feedback)
- O _ S _ _  (O in position 1, S in position 3) – but S cannot be in position 3 (from PISON feedback)
- _ S _ _ O  (S in position 2, O in position 5)
- _ _ _ O S – invalid (O in position 4)
- _ _ O _ S – invalid (O in position 3)
- _ _ S O _ – invalid (S in position 3)

Only remaining valid pattern:
- _ S _ _ O  (S in position 2, O in position 5)

So the word must be: _ S _ _ O

Letters allowed (not in eliminated list): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two consonants in positions 3 and 4.

Common combinations:
- B, C, D, F, G, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- B S _ _ O: BSC?O, BSE?O – but E is eliminated
- C S _ _ O: C S C _ O, C S D _ O – CSD?O
- D S _ _ O: D S _ _ O
- F S _ _ O: F S _ _ O
- G S _ _ O: G S _ _ O
- M S _ _ O: M S _ _ O

Looking for actual 5-letter words ending in -S_O:

- BESOM – but E is eliminated
- BISON – N is eliminated
- CROCS – C, R, O, C, S – R is eliminated
- DUSKO – but K is allowed
- FUSCO – but F, U, S, C, O – all letters allowed
- GUSLE – E is eliminated
- JUSCO – J, U, S, C, O – all letters allowed
- MUSCO – M, U, S, C, O – all letters allowed
- VUSCO – V, U, S, C, O – all letters allowed

""FUSCO"", ""JUSCO"", ""MUSCO"", ""VUSCO"" are all valid. ""FUSCO"" is a common enough word.

Let's verify:
- F, U, S, C, O – none are in the eliminated list.
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- O is in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both S and O
- No other constraints violated

Let's summarize the information we have so far.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N, F, C

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (--feedback):
O, S, U

Positions ruled out:
- O: cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from AROSE, SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – The only remaining position for O is 1.
- S: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 (from SLOTH, PISON, FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.
- U: cannot be in position 2 (from FUSCO)
  – Possible positions for U: 3, 4, or 5.

So the word must:
1. Start with O (position 1).
2. Contain both S and U in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, with:
   – S not in 1,3,4 → S must be in 2 or 5.
   – U not in 2 → U must be in 3,4, or 5.
3. Use only letters not yet eliminated.

Remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the required O, S, U).

Possible patterns:
- O S _ _ _  (but then where does U go?)
- O _ S _ _  (S in 3 is invalid)
- O _ _ S _  (S in 4 is invalid)
- O _ _ _ S  (S in 5 is allowed)
- O _ U _ _  (U in 3 is allowed)
- O _ _ U _  (U in 4 is allowed)
- O _ _ _ U  (U in 5 is allowed)

The only valid pattern that satisfies all constraints is:
O _ _ _ S  (S in 5) with U placed in positions 3 or 4.

So the word structure is: O _ U _ S or O _ _ U S.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit:
- O _ U _ S:  ""OBUYS"" – but B and Y are allowed, but ""OBUYS"" is not a common word.
- O _ _ U S:  ""ODUFS"" – not valid.
- ""OGLES"" – but L is eliminated.
- ""OVENS"" – N is eliminated.
- ""OUSTS"" – T is eliminated.
- ""OWLS"" – too short.
- ""OXYS"" – too short.
- ""OBUYS"" – seems the closest fit, but let's check another angle.

Wait, let's list possible combinations:
Letters: O, S, U plus two from remaining: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters. Let's try common consonants.

Possible words:
- O B U S _ – but S must be last.
- O B U S _ – need a 5th letter, but S is already 5th.
- O B U S _ – no.
- O B _ U S – ""OBUYS"" – yes, but Y is allowed.

Is ""OBUYS"" a valid word? It means to buy, but it's uncommon. Let's think of others.

- O D U S _ – ""ODUS"" – no.
- O G U S _ – ""OGUS"" – no.
- O M U S _ – ""OMUS"" – no.
- O V U S _ – ""OVUS"" – no.

Alternative: maybe ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Another pattern: O _ U S _ – but S must be last (position 5), so this is same as above.

Actually, the only possible structure is O _ _ _ S with U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O B U _ S – ""OBUYS"" (Y is allowed)
- O D U _ S – ""ODUYS"" – no.
- O G U _ S – ""OGUYS"" – no.
- O M U _ S – ""OMUYS"" – no.
- O V U _ S – ""OVUYS"" – no.

Another approach: maybe the word has another letter that is allowed.

Wait, let's list all possible combinations systematically.

We have O _ _ _ S and must include U somewhere in positions 2,3,4.

So possible positions for U:
- Position 2: O U _ _ S – but U cannot be in position 2 (from FUSCO feedback). So invalid.
- Position 3: O _ U _ S – valid.
- Position 4: O _ _ U S – valid.

So we need:
1. O _ U _ S
2. O _ _ U S

Let's find valid words:

1. O _ U _ S:
   - O B U S _ – no 5th letter.
   - O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last.
   - Actually, this would be O B U S _ – but we need 5 letters total, so O B U S _ is 4 letters. We need one more letter, but S is already last. This seems impossible.

Wait, the word must be exactly 5 letters with O in 1, S in 5, and U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O _ U _ S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:S
- O _ _ U S – positions: 1:O, 2:?, 3:?, 4:U, 5:S

Let's find valid words:

For O _ U _ S:
- O B U S _ – need 5th letter, but S is last. So O B U S _ is 4 letters. Not possible.
- Actually, the word is O _ U _ S, so positions 2 and 4 need letters. So possible:
  - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
  - O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
  - O B U G S – ""OBUGS"" – not a word.
  - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
  - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.

For O _ _ U S:
- O B D U S – ""OBDUS"" – no.
- O B G U S – ""OBGUS"" – no.
- O B M U S – ""OBMUS"" – no.
- O B V U S – ""OBVUS"" – no.
- O D M U S – ""ODMUS"" – no.
- O G M U S – ""OGMUS"" – no.
- O M B U S – ""OMBUS"" – no.
- O M D U S – ""OMDUS"" – no.
- O M G U S – ""OMGUS"" – no.
- O M V U S – ""OMVUS"" – no.
- O V M U S – ""OVMUS"" – no.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed a word.

Wait, let's think differently: perhaps the word has another letter that is allowed.

Actually, the letters we have are O, S, U plus two from remaining: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word with O, S, U and two others from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O B S U _ – but S must be last.
- O S U _ _ – but O must be first, S must be last, so O S U _ _ – but then where is U?
  - O S U _ _ – this would require U to be in position 3, but then we have O S U _ _ which is 4 letters. Not possible.

Another approach: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Wait, let's list all possible 5-letter words that contain O, S, U with the constraints.

Given:
- O must be in position 1
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- U must be in position 3,4, or 5
- No other letters from eliminated list.

Let's try:
- O S _ _ U – but then S is in position 2, U in 5. Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  Possible: O S B D U – ""OSBDU"" – no.
  - O S B U _ – need 5th letter, but U is in 4, S in 2, O in 1. So O S _ U _ – need 3rd letter.
    - O S B U _ – ""OSBU_"" – no.
    - O S D U _ – ""OSDUX"" – no.
    - O S M U _ – ""OSMUD"" – no.
    - O S V U _ – ""OSVUD"" – no.

- O _ S _ U – but S cannot be in position 3 (from PISON feedback).

- O _ _ S U – but S cannot be in position 4 (from SLOTH feedback).

- O _ _ _ S – S in position 5, U must be in 3 or 4.
  - O _ U _ S – need 2nd and 4th letters from allowed.
    - O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
    - O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
    - O G U M S – ""OGUMS"" – no.
    - O M U B S – ""OMUBS"" – no.
    - O V U M S – ""OVUMS"" – no.
  - O _ _ U S – need 2nd and 3rd letters from allowed.
    - O B _ U S – ""OBUYS"" – this seems the closest, but Y is allowed.
      - ""OBUYS"" – is this a valid word? It means ""to buy"", but it's uncommon. However, it's listed in some dictionaries as an archaic form.
    - O D _ U S – ""ODUYS"" – no.
    - O G _ U S – ""OGUYS"" – no.
    - O M _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.
    - O V _ U S – ""OVUYS"" – no.

Given the constraints, ""OBUYS"" appears to be the only possible word that fits, even if it's uncommon. However, let's double-check if we missed any other words.

Alternative: perhaps the word is ""OUSTS"" but T is eliminated.

Another check: maybe ""OUSTS"" is invalid due to T, so next possible is ""OBUYS"".

But let's think of others:
- O _ U _ S – ""OJUYS"" – no.
- O _ _ U S – ""OMUYS"" – no.

After careful consideration, ""OBUYS"" seems to be the only possible word that fits all constraints, despite being uncommon.

However, upon reflection, I realize I might have missed a more common word. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the letters allowed are O, S, U plus two from: B, D, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me try:
- O B U S _ – no.
- O D U S _ – no.
- O G U S _ – no.
- O M U S _ – no.
- O V U S _ – no.

Actually, the correct structure is O _ _ _ S with U in 3 or 4.

So:
- O B U D S – ""OBU DS"" – no.
- O B U M S – ""OBU MS"" – no.
- O D U B S – ""ODUBS"" – no.
- O D U M S – ""ODUMS"" – yes! ""ODUMS"" is a valid word (plural of odum, a small tree or a unit of energy in ecology).

Let's verify ""ODUMS"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)
- D in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- M in position 4 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- Contains both S and U
- No letters from eliminated list
- S is in position 5 (not ruled out)
- U is in position 3 (not ruled out)

""ODUMS"" fits all constraints perfectly.Given all constraints, the only remaining valid word is ""ODUMS"".

From the new feedback on ODUMS:

- O(-) : O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it couldn’t be 2,3,4,5 from earlier guesses; now we know it must be position 1, but the feedback says it’s wrong there. This is a contradiction, meaning my earlier deduction was flawed.)

Wait — let’s re-examine the position constraints carefully after every guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – O is in word, not in position 3
   – S is in word, not in position 4
   – A, R, E absent

2. SLOTH → S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
   – S is in word, not in position 1
   – O is in word, not in position 3
   – L, T, H absent

3. PISON → P(x) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   – S is in word, not in position 3
   – O is in word, not in position 4
   – P, I, N absent

4. FUSCO → F(x) U(-) S(-) C(x) O(-)
   – U is in word, not in position 2
   – S is in word, not in position 3
   – O is in word, not in position 5
   – F, C absent

5. ODUMS → O(-) D(x) U(-) M(x) S(✓)
   – S is in position 5 (✓) — now we know the word ends with S
   – O is in word, not in position 1
   – U is in word, not in position 3
   – D, M absent

Now we can list the absolute constraints:

- Word ends with S (position 5 is S)
- Contains O, U, S (S already fixed at position 5)
- O cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5
  – Therefore O must be in position 2
- U cannot be in positions 2, 3
  – Possible positions: 1, 4
- S is fixed at position 5
- Letters absent so far: A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N, F, C, D, M
- Remaining allowed letters: B, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So far we have:
- Position 1: U or B or G or J or K or Q or V or W or X or Y or Z
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining allowed letters (cannot be U because U cannot be in position 3)
- Position 4: must be one of the remaining allowed letters (could be U if U is in position 4)
- Position 5: S

Possible patterns:
- If U is in position 1: U O _ _ S
- If U is in position 4: _ O _ U S

Let’s explore both.

1. U O _ _ S
   – Positions 3 and 4 need letters from allowed set (B, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
   – Need a valid 5-letter word starting with UO and ending with S
   – Scanning possibilities: UO_B_S, UO_GB_S, etc. — none seem valid.

2. _ O _ U S
   – Position 1: any allowed letter except those already excluded
   – Position 3: any allowed letter except those already excluded
   – Need a valid 5-letter word with pattern ? O ? U S
   – Let’s list possible combinations:
     - B O B U S – ""BOBUS"" – valid (a type of plant)
     - B O G U S – ""BOGUS"" – valid (meaning deceptive)
     - G O B U S – ""GOBUS"" – not a word
     - J O B U S – ""JOBUS"" – not a word
     - K O B U S – ""KOBUS"" – valid (a type of antelope)
     - V O B U S – ""VOBUS"" – not a word

Among these, ""BOGUS"" and ""BOBUS"" are the most likely. ""BOGUS"" is more common.

Let’s verify ""BOGUS"" against all constraints:
- Ends with S – yes
- Contains O, U, S – yes
- O is in position 2 – allowed
- U is in position 4 – allowed
- Letters used: B, O, G, U, S – none are in the banned list
- No other constraints violated

Thus, ""BOGUS"" is the correct guess.

<guess>BOGUS</guess>",BOGUS,"From the new feedback on ODUMS:

- O(-) : O is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it couldn’t be 2,3,4,5 from earlier guesses; now we know it must be position 1, but the feedback says it’s wrong there. This is a contradiction, meaning my earlier deduction was flawed.)

Wait — let’s re-examine the position constraints carefully after every guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – O is in word, not in position 3
   – S is in word, not in position 4
   – A, R, E absent

2. SLOTH → S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
   – S is in word, not in position 1
   – O is in word, not in position 3
   – L, T, H absent

3. PISON → P(x) I(x) S(-) O(-) N(x)
   – S is in word, not in position 3
   – O is in word, not in position 4
   – P, I, N absent

4. FUSCO → F(x) U(-) S(-) C(x) O(-)
   – U is in word, not in position 2
   – S is in word, not in position 3
   – O is in word, not in position 5
   – F, C absent

5. ODUMS → O(-) D(x) U(-) M(x) S(✓)
   – S is in position 5 (✓) — now we know the word ends with S
   – O is in word, not in position 1
   – U is in word, not in position 3
   – D, M absent

Now we can list the absolute constraints:

- Word ends with S (position 5 is S)
- Contains O, U, S (S already fixed at position 5)
- O cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5
  – Therefore O must be in position 2
- U cannot be in positions 2, 3
  – Possible positions: 1, 4
- S is fixed at position 5
- Letters absent so far: A, R, E, L, T, H, P, I, N, F, C, D, M
- Remaining allowed letters: B, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

So far we have:
- Position 1: U or B or G or J or K or Q or V or W or X or Y or Z
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining allowed letters (cannot be U because U cannot be in position 3)
- Position 4: must be one of the remaining allowed letters (could be U if U is in position 4)
- Position 5: S

Possible patterns:
- If U is in position 1: U O _ _ S
- If U is in position 4: _ O _ U S

Let’s explore both.

1. U O _ _ S
   – Positions 3 and 4 need letters from allowed set (B, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
   – Need a valid 5-letter word starting with UO and ending with S

2. _ O _ U S
   – Position 1: any allowed letter except those already excluded
   – Position 3: any allowed letter except those already excluded
   – Need a valid 5-letter word with pattern ? O ? U S
   – Let’s list possible combinations:
     - B O B U S – ""BOBUS"" – valid (a type of plant)
     - B O G U S – ""BOGUS"" – valid (meaning deceptive)
     - G O B U S – ""GOBUS"" – not a word
     - J O B U S – ""JOBUS"" – not a word
     - K O B U S – ""KOBUS"" – valid (a type of antelope)
     - V O B U S – ""VOBUS"" – not a word

- No other constraints violated

Thus, ""BOGUS"" is the correct guess.",Guess 6: BOGUS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) G(x) U(✓) S(✓),FAIL
