For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word is C _ _ _ _ and none of R, A, N, E appear anywhere.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, N, E  
Letters we know are in the word: C (fixed at position 1)

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good candidates are:  
S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced word that starts with C and avoids R,A,N,E while using other frequent letters is “CLOUD”. It includes C (already fixed), plus L, O, U, D which are all still possible.

Another option is “CLOUD” or “STOCK” but since C is locked in position 1, “CLOUD” fits perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the correct first position (✓)
- R, A, N, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word is C _ _ _ _ and none of R, A, N, E appear anywhere.

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, N, E  
Letters we know are in the word: C (fixed at position 1)

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good candidates are:  
S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced word that starts with C and avoids R,A,N,E while using other frequent letters is “CLOUD”. It includes C (already fixed), plus L, O, U, D which are all still possible.

Another option is “CLOUD” or “STOCK” but since C is locked in position 1, “CLOUD” fits perfectly.

I’ll go with CLOUD.

- Letters already ruled out: R, A, N, E, L, O, D.
- Letters confirmed in the word: C (position 1), U (somewhere, but not position 4 since it was marked ✓ in CLOUD but position 4 in CLOUD is D which was x, so U must be in position 2, 3, or 5).

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ _ with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

A word like ""CUPID"" comes to mind but D is ruled out. ""CUSHY"" - H and Y are possible. ""CUMIN"" - but N is ruled out. ""CUPST"" - not a word. ""CUBIT"" - B, I, T are possible.

""CUBIT"" is a valid word and fits the constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Doesn't contain R, A, N, E, L, O, D.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)

From the feedback on CRANE:

Next, I want to test other common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out yet. Good candidates are:  
S, T, O, I, L, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A balanced word that starts with C and avoids R,A,N,E while using other frequent letters is “CLOUD”. It includes C (already fixed), plus L, O, U, D which are all still possible.

Another option is “CLOUD” or “STOCK” but since C is locked in position 1, “CLOUD” fits perfectly.

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ _ with U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Possible letters left (excluding the ruled out ones): B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place U in position 2: C U _ _ _
We need three more letters from the remaining pool. Good candidates: S, T, I, K, M, P, B.

A word like ""CUPID"" comes to mind but D is ruled out. ""CUSHY"" - H and Y are possible. ""CUMIN"" - but N is ruled out. ""CUPST"" - not a word. ""CUBIT"" - B, I, T are possible.

""CUBIT"" is a valid word and fits the constraints:
- Starts with C.
- Doesn't contain R, A, N, E, L, O, D.
- Contains U in position 2.
- Uses B, I, T which are still possible.

Let’s go with CUBIT.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   → Word starts with C, and R, A, N, E are absent.

2. CLOUD → C(✓) L(x) O(x) U(✓) D(x)  
   → U is in the word, but not in position 4 (D was x anyway).

3. CUBIT → C(✓) U(✓) B(x) I(x) T(x)  
   → U is in position 2, and B, I, T are absent.

Current pattern: C U _ _ _

Letters ruled out so far: R, A, N, E, L, O, D, B, I, T

Remaining common letters: S, M, P, K, F, G, H, Y, W, etc.

We need three more letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 3, 4, 5.

Possible words:
- CUPID – but D is out.
- CUSHY – H, S, Y are still possible.
- CUMIN – M, I, N: I and N are out.
- CUPPY – P, P, Y: P and Y are possible, but double P might be less likely.
- CUMBO – B is out.
- CUPST – not a word.
- CUPCA – A is out.
- CUPID – D is out.
- CUPSO – O is out.
- CUPPA – A is out.
- CUPPY – already considered.

The most promising valid word that fits all constraints is CUSHY:
- C (position 1) ✓
- U (position 2) ✓
- S, H, Y have not been ruled out.

Current constraints:

- Pattern: C U S _ _  (C, U, S are locked in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively)
- Letters ruled out so far: R, A, N, E, L, O, D, B, I, T, H, Y
- Remaining possible letters: F, G, K, M, P, W, V, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining pool and forming a valid English word.

Possible endings:
- CUSPY – P, Y; Y is ruled out.
- CUSKS – K, S; S is already used in position 3, but letters can repeat if valid.
- CUSPS – P, S; S is already used.
- CUSCO – C, O; O is ruled out.
- CUSKS – K, S; ""cusks"" is not a common word.
- CUSPY – invalid (Y out).
- CUSKS – questionable validity.
- CUSPS – valid word, but S repeats.
- CUSKS – not standard.
- CUSPY – invalid.
- CUSKS – not standard.
- CUSPS – valid, but S repeats.

The only valid word left seems to be CUSPS, despite the repeated S. However, since letters can repeat in words even if marked x in feedback (unless the feedback explicitly indicates it), and CUSPS is a valid English word, this is the logical choice.

Alternative: CUSKS is not valid. CUSPY invalid. CUSPS is the only valid remaining word.

Therefore, the next guess is CUSPS.

Current confirmed information:

1. Pattern: C U S _ _  (positions 1-3 locked)
2. Letters ruled out: R, A, N, E, L, O, D, B, I, T, H, Y, P
3. Letter S appears in the word (already in position 3) and also appears again somewhere else (feedback shows second S as “-”, meaning it exists but is in the wrong position).

Since S is already in position 3, the second S must be in position 4 or 5. The only way to place another S is position 4 or 5.

Possible endings:
- C U S S _  (but we already have CUSPS which failed at position 4)
- C U S _ S

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit C U S _ S:
- CUSPS – already tried, P is out.
- CUSKS – K is still allowed, word is valid.
- CUSMS – not a word.
- CUSGS – not a word.
- CUSLS – not a word.

The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern and uses an allowed letter (K) is CUSKS.

Let’s verify:
- C (✓), U (✓), S (✓) already locked.
- Second S must be in position 4 or 5. Position 4 is K (allowed), position 5 is S (allowed).
- CUSKS is a valid English word.

Therefore, CUSKS is the logical next guess.
