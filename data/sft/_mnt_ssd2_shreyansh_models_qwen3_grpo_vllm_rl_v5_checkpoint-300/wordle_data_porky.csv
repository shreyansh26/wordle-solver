1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- CHIMP → C, H, I, M are absent, but P is present somewhere in the word (wrong position).

So far we have eliminated 14 distinct letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M plus P is known to be in the word but not in position 5).

Letters still available (excluding those 14) and including P:
B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and P which we know is in the word).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains P (since we know P is in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M.
3. Has P in a position other than 5 (since P was marked “-” in position 5 of CHIMP).

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One straightforward approach is to pick a word with P in position 1-4 and use other remaining letters.

A good candidate is “PROUD”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed, since P was only excluded from position 5).
- R, O, U, D are all still allowed letters (not in the eliminated set).
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.

Let’s verify:
- P is present (confirmed by feedback it’s in the word).
- R, O, U, D are not yet eliminated.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M) are used.

Thus, “PROUD” is a valid and informative next guess.

Current knowledge:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M, U, D

2. Letters that **are** in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions:
   - P (now confirmed to be in position 1)
   - R (somewhere, but not in position 2)
   - O (somewhere, but not in position 3)

3. Therefore the secret word has the form:
   P _ _ _ _  
   with R and O still to be placed among positions 2-5, and they cannot go where the feedback said “wrong position.”

Letters still available (excluding the 12 eliminated ones):
B, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters P, R, O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Uses R and O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Uses only the still-allowed letters
- Has no repeats of letters already ruled out.

A quick scan of possible combinations yields “PORNO” (though that’s not a valid English word).  
Another candidate: “PRION” – but I is already eliminated.  
“PROXY” – Y is allowed, X is allowed, but we only need two extra letters so far (R and O).  
“PRONG” – G is allowed, N is allowed, but we already know O cannot be in position 3.  
“PRYGO” – G and Y are allowed, but G and Y are both extra; we only need R and O placed.  
“PRVOW” – V and W are allowed, but again, we only need R and O placed.

A simpler, valid English word that fits is “PRION” – but I is eliminated.  
“PRION” is invalid because I is eliminated.

Another valid word: “PRONG” – but O is in position 3, and feedback said O is in the word but not in position 3. So O cannot be in position 3.  
Hence “PRONG” is invalid.

Next candidate: “PRYGO” – not a valid English word.

Possible placements:
- Position 2: O, then R must be in 3,4,5
- Position 2: R, then O must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 3, and 2 is taken by R)

Let’s try:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common English letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used at all.  
The remaining most common letters are R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, Y, W.  
A good second-guess word should use 5 of these, avoiding any repeats and covering a wide range.  
Popular second-guess choices include:  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- PRONG (P, R, O, N, G)  

“CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—five distinct high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet, giving us broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- CHIMP → C, H, I, M are absent, but P is present somewhere in the word (wrong position).

So far we have eliminated 14 distinct letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M plus P is known to be in the word but not in position 5).

Letters still available (excluding those 14) and including P:
B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and P which we know is in the word).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains P (since we know P is in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M.
3. Has P in a position other than 5 (since P was marked “-” in position 5 of CHIMP).

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One straightforward approach is to pick a word with P in position 1-4 and use other remaining letters.

A good candidate is “PROUD”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed, since P was only excluded from position 5).
- R, O, U, D are all still allowed letters (not in the eliminated set).
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.

Let’s verify:
- P is present (confirmed by feedback it’s in the word).
- R, O, U, D are not yet eliminated.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M) are used.

Thus, “PROUD” is a valid and informative next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any, to test as many unique letters as possible.

Some popular and effective first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it covers the top 5 most frequent letters (E, A, S, T, L) and has no repeating letters. This gives us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 of the most common English letters, so we need a fresh set of high-frequency letters that weren’t used at all.  
The remaining most common letters are R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, Y, W.  
A good second-guess word should use 5 of these, avoiding any repeats and covering a wide range.  
Popular second-guess choices include:  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- PRONG (P, R, O, N, G)  

“CHIMP” uses C, H, I, M, P—five distinct high-frequency letters we haven’t tried yet, giving us broad coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Guess 2: CHIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) M(x) P(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → S, L, A, T, E are all absent.
- CHIMP → C, H, I, M are absent, but P is present somewhere in the word (wrong position).

So far we have eliminated 14 distinct letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M plus P is known to be in the word but not in position 5).

Letters still available (excluding those 14) and including P:
B, D, F, G, J, K, N, O, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and P which we know is in the word).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains P (since we know P is in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M.
3. Has P in a position other than 5 (since P was marked “-” in position 5 of CHIMP).

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. One straightforward approach is to pick a word with P in position 1-4 and use other remaining letters.

A good candidate is “PROUD”:
- P is in position 1 (allowed, since P was only excluded from position 5).
- R, O, U, D are all still allowed letters (not in the eliminated set).
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.

Let’s verify:
- P is present (confirmed by feedback it’s in the word).
- R, O, U, D are not yet eliminated.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M) are used.

Thus, “PROUD” is a valid and informative next guess.

Current knowledge:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   S, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M, U, D

2. Letters that **are** in the word, but we still don’t know their exact positions:
   - P (now confirmed to be in position 1)
   - R (somewhere, but not in position 2)
   - O (somewhere, but not in position 3)

3. Therefore the secret word has the form:
   P _ _ _ _  
   with R and O still to be placed among positions 2-5, and they cannot go where the feedback said “wrong position.”

Letters still available (excluding the 12 eliminated ones):
B, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters P, R, O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P
- Uses R and O somewhere in positions 2-5
- Uses only the still-allowed letters
- Has no repeats of letters already ruled out.

A quick scan of possible combinations yields “PORNO” (though that’s not a valid English word).  
Another candidate: “PRION” – but I is already eliminated.  
“PROXY” – Y is allowed, X is allowed, but we only need two extra letters so far (R and O).  
“PRONG” – G is allowed, N is allowed, but we already know O cannot be in position 3.  
“PRYGO” – G and Y are allowed, but G and Y are both extra; we only need R and O placed.  
“PRVOW” – V and W are allowed, but again, we only need R and O placed.

A simpler, valid English word that fits is “PRION” – but I is eliminated.  
“PRION” is invalid because I is eliminated.

Another valid word: “PRONG” – but O is in position 3, and feedback said O is in the word but not in position 3. So O cannot be in position 3.  
Hence “PRONG” is invalid.

Next candidate: “PRYGO” – not a valid English word.  
“PRVOW” – not valid.

Valid English word: “PRYON” – but Y is allowed, N is allowed, but I is eliminated.  
“PRYON” is valid (a variant of “pry” + “ion”), but let’s stick to more common words.

Another valid word: “PRION” – invalid (I eliminated).

Another valid word: “PRYOT” – but T is eliminated.

Valid word: “PRYGO” – invalid.

Valid word: “PRVOW” – invalid.

Valid word: “PRYOK” – invalid.

Valid word: “PRYON” – acceptable.

But let’s try a more common word: “PRYGO” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible placements:

We have P _ _ _ _

R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2).  
O must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).

We need to place R and O in positions 2-5 without conflict, and fill the remaining two spots with allowed letters.

Possible placements:
- Position 2: O, then R must be in 3,4,5
- Position 2: R, then O must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 3, and 2 is taken by R)

Let’s try:
- P O R _ _ : Then we need two more letters from B, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Valid word: “PORNO” – invalid.  
  “PORNY” – Y is allowed, N is allowed. “PORNY” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- Starts with P (✓)
- O in position 2 (allowed, since O was not excluded from position 2)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was not excluded from position 3)
- N and Y are allowed letters
- No eliminated letters used

Therefore, “PORNY” is a valid guess that satisfies all constraints.

So O cannot be in position 3.  \nHence “PRONG” is invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “PRYGO” – not a valid English word.  \n“PRVOW” – not valid.\n\nValid English word: “PRYON” – but Y is allowed, N is allowed, but I is eliminated.  \n“PRYON” is valid (a variant of “pry” + “ion”), but let’s stick to more common words.\n\nAnother valid word: “PRION” – invalid (I eliminated).\n\nAnother valid word: “PRYOT” – but T is eliminated.\n\nValid word: “PRYGO” – invalid.\n\nValid word: “PRVOW” – invalid.\n\nValid word: “PRYOK” – invalid.\n\nValid word: “PRYON” – acceptable.\n\nBut let’s try a more common word: “PRYGO” is invalid.\n\nWait, let’s list possible placements:\n\nWe have P _ _ _ _\n\nR must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2).  \nO must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).\n\nWe need to place R and O in positions 2-5 without conflict, and fill the remaining two spots with allowed letters.\n\nPossible placements:\n- Position 2: O, then R must be in 3,4,5\n- Position 2: R, then O must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be 3, and 2 is taken by R)\n\nLet’s try:\n- P O R _ _ : Then we need two more letters from B, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n  Valid word: “PORNO” – invalid.  \n  “PORNY” – Y is allowed, N is allowed. “PORNY” is a valid English word.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Starts with P (✓)\n- O in position 2 (allowed, since O was not excluded from position 2)\n- R in position 3 (allowed, since R was not excluded from position 3)\n- N and Y are allowed letters\n- No eliminated letters used\n\nTherefore, “PORNY” is a valid guess that satisfies all constraints.\n\n<guess>PORNY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) M(x) P(-)\nGuess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(-) O(-) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: PORNY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the latest feedback:\n\n- P(✓)  → P is in position 1 (fixed).\n- O(✓)  → O is in position 2 (fixed).\n- R(✓)  → R is in position 3 (fixed).\n- Y(✓)  → Y is in position 5 (fixed).\n- N(x)  → N is not in the word at all.\n\nSo the word structure is now:\nP  O  R  _  Y\n\nOnly the 4th letter is unknown.  \nLetters already ruled out (besides N):  \nS, L, A, T, E, C, H, I, M, U, D, N\n\nRemaining letters that can fill position 4:  \nB, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter English word of the form POR _ Y.\n\nPossible candidates:  \n- PORGY (a valid word, fish species)  \n- PORKY (slang/variant, but listed in some dictionaries)  \n- PORVY (not valid)  \n- PORZY (not valid)  \n\n“PORGY” is the only common, valid English word that fits.\n\nTherefore, the next guess must be “PORGY”.\n\n<guess>PORGY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHIMP -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) M(x) P(-)\nGuess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(-) O(-) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 4: PORNY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) N(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: PORGY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
