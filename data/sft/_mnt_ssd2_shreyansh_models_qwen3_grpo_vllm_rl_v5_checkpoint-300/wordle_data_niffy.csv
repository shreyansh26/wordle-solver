Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
For the next guess I want to pick a word that uses entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still quite common so I can narrow things down quickly.

- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, K (12 letters gone).
- Letters we now know are in the word: I (correct position) and Y (correct position).
- Letters we know are in the word but not in the guessed positions: N (from MINKY, N was in position 3 but is not there).

So the secret word has:
- I in position 2 (since I got ✓ in MINKY at position 2)
- Y in position 5 (since Y got ✓ in MINKY at position 5)
- N somewhere else (since N got - in MINKY at position 3)

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus N and the known I/Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2
- Has Y in position 5
- Contains N somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Uses only the remaining letters

Possible patterns: _ I _ _ Y with N in one of the blanks.

Looking at common words fitting this:
- N I _ _ Y: NINNY (but N is already used in position 1, and we need N elsewhere)
- _ I N _ Y: FINNY (but F and N are allowed, but K is eliminated)
- _ I _ N Y: PINNY (P is allowed, N is allowed)
- _ I _ _ Y with N: BINGY (but G is allowed, but N is in position 3)
- _ I _ _ Y with N: WINNY (W is allowed, N is in position 3)

""PINNY"" fits:
- P (allowed)
- I (correct position 2)

Based on the feedback, the word must:
- Have I in position 2 and Y in position 5
- Contain N somewhere other than position 3
- Use only remaining letters (B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, N, I, Y)

""NIBBY"" fits these constraints:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, K (12 letters gone).
- Letters we now know are in the word: I (correct position) and Y (correct position).
- Letters we know are in the word but not in the guessed positions: N (from MINKY, N was in position 3 but is not there).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
For the next guess I want to pick a word that uses entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still quite common so I can narrow things down quickly.  
Good candidates for the second guess include:  
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)  
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K)  

Among these, “CHORD” uses five distinct letters that are all fairly common and covers both vowels (O) and several consonants (C, H, R, D). I’ll go with that.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CHORD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Both previous guesses (SLATE and CHORD) used 10 distinct letters and every one of them was marked “x”, so we now know that the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D.  
That’s 10 letters already eliminated.  
We still have the full alphabet minus those 10 letters to work with.  
A good next guess should pick five new letters that are still common and give us a fresh set of consonants and vowels.  
Looking at remaining frequent letters, good choices include:  
- N, I, U, M, K, G, P, B, F, V, W, Y, etc.  

A balanced word that uses five of these common remaining letters is “MINKY”.  
It has:  
- M (common consonant)  
- I (common vowel)  
- N (common consonant)  
- K (common consonant)  
- Y (semi-common vowel-like letter)  

This should help us gather new information quickly.

- Letters we now know are in the word: I (correct position) and Y (correct position).
- Letters we know are in the word but not in the guessed positions: N (from MINKY, N was in position 3 but is not there).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters that appear in many English words, maximizing the chance of getting useful feedback. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
For the next guess I want to pick a word that uses entirely different letters—preferably ones that are still quite common so I can narrow things down quickly.  
Good candidates for the second guess include:  
- CRIMP (C, R, I, M, P)  
- CHORD (C, H, O, R, D)  
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K)  

Among these, “CHORD” uses five distinct letters that are all fairly common and covers both vowels (O) and several consonants (C, H, R, D). I’ll go with that.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Both previous guesses (SLATE and CHORD) used 10 distinct letters and every one of them was marked “x”, so we now know that the secret word contains none of: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D.  
That’s 10 letters already eliminated.  
We still have the full alphabet minus those 10 letters to work with.  
A good next guess should pick five new letters that are still common and give us a fresh set of consonants and vowels.  
Looking at remaining frequent letters, good choices include:  
- N, I, U, M, K, G, P, B, F, V, W, Y, etc.  

A balanced word that uses five of these common remaining letters is “MINKY”.  
It has:  
- M (common consonant)  
- I (common vowel)  
- N (common consonant)  
- K (common consonant)  
- Y (semi-common vowel-like letter)  

This should help us gather new information quickly.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, M, K (12 letters gone).
- Letters we now know are in the word: I (correct position) and Y (correct position).
- Letters we know are in the word but not in the guessed positions: N (from MINKY, N was in position 3 but is not there).

So the secret word has:
- I in position 2 (since I got ✓ in MINKY at position 2)
- Y in position 5 (since Y got ✓ in MINKY at position 5)
- N somewhere else (since N got - in MINKY at position 3)

Remaining possible letters (not yet eliminated): B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, plus N and the known I/Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2
- Has Y in position 5
- Contains N somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Uses only the remaining letters

Possible patterns: _ I _ _ Y with N in one of the blanks.

Looking at common words fitting this:
- N I _ _ Y: NINNY (but N is already used in position 1, and we need N elsewhere)
- _ I N _ Y: FINNY (but F and N are allowed, but K is eliminated)
- _ I _ N Y: PINNY (P is allowed, N is allowed)
- _ I _ _ Y with N: BINGY (but G is allowed, but N is in position 3)
- _ I _ _ Y with N: WINNY (W is allowed, N is in position 3)

""PINNY"" fits:
- P (allowed)
- I (correct position 2)
- N (must be in word, placed in position 3 here)
- N (again, but allowed)
- Y (correct position 5)

But PINNY has N in position 3, which was the same position as in MINKY where N got ""-"", so N can't be in position 3. So PINNY is invalid.

Next option: ""WINNY"":
- W (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, but same as MINKY where N was ""-"", so invalid)

Next: ""FINNY"":
- F (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, same issue)

Next: ""BINGY"":
- B (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, same issue)

Next: ""JINGY"":
- J (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, same issue)

Next: ""PINKY"":
- P (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, same issue)

Next: ""NINNY"":
- N (position 1, allowed since N must be elsewhere)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, but this was ""-"", so N cannot be in position 3)
- N (position 4)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

But NINNY has N in position 3 (invalid) and position 1/4 (but N must be in word, and here it's in 1 and 4, but position 3 is invalid).

Alternative: ""PINGY"":
- P (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, invalid)
- G (allowed)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

Still N in position 3.

Alternative: ""WIMPY"":
- W (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- M (eliminated)
- P (allowed)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

But M is eliminated.

Alternative: ""FILMY"":
- F (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- L (eliminated)
- M (eliminated)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

L and M eliminated.

Alternative: ""FIBRY"":
- F (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- B (allowed)
- R (eliminated)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

R eliminated.

Alternative: ""FIPSY"":

- P (allowed)
- S (eliminated)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

S eliminated.

Alternative: ""FILMY"" already eliminated.

Alternative: ""JIFFY"":
- J (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- F (allowed)
- F (allowed)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

No N here, but N must be in the word (from MINKY feedback), so this is invalid.

Alternative: ""PINYU"":
- P (allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- N (position 3, invalid)
- Y (position 4, but Y must be position 5)
- U (allowed)

Invalid positions for Y.

Alternative: ""BINGO"" - but O eliminated.

Alternative: ""BINGY"" already considered.

Alternative: ""PINKY"" - N in position 3 invalid.

Alternative: ""WIMPY"" - M eliminated.

Alternative: ""FINGY"" - R eliminated.

Alternative: ""FINNY"" - N in position 3 invalid.

Alternative: ""PINGY"" - N in position 3 invalid.

Alternative: ""NIBBY"":
- N (position 1, allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- B (allowed)
- B (allowed)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

No N in position 3 here, so N is in position 1. This fits:
- N (position 1, allowed)
- I (position 2 ✓)
- B (position 3, allowed)
- B (position 4, allowed)
- Y (position 5 ✓)

And N is in the word (from MINKY), and not in position 3 (so position 1 is fine).

""NIBBY"" seems valid.Based on the feedback, the word must:
- Have I in position 2 and Y in position 5
- Contain N somewhere other than position 3
- Use only remaining letters (B, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, N, I, Y)

""NIBBY"" fits these constraints:
- N in position 1 (not 3)
- I in position 2 ✓
- B in positions 3 & 4 (allowed)
- Y in position 5 ✓
