### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Contains A, but not in position 1.

I need a new word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess could be ""TAINT"":
- Uses A in position 2 (different from first guess).
- Uses common consonants T and N.
- Uses I (another vowel).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

This should give good information about the presence of T, I, N and confirm A's position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1 is wrong).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Contains A, but not in position 1.

I need a new word that:
1. Includes A in a different position (not first).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess could be ""TAINT"":
- Uses A in position 2 (different from first guess).
- Uses common consonants T and N.
- Uses I (another vowel).
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

This should give good information about the presence of T, I, N and confirm A's position.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: A (and it is in position 2)

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining common vowels: U (since A is already placed and E, I, O are out)

To maximize information, I want to test several new consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is “CABBY”:
- Keeps A in the known correct position 2.
- Tests C, B, Y (all new consonants) and repeats B to check for duplicate letters.

If any of C, B, Y are in the word, the feedback will pinpoint them. If not, we’ll still learn three new letters are absent.

So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _ with C and Y somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

I want to test a new set of consonants while keeping A fixed and placing C and Y in new positions. A good candidate is “MACHY”:

We now know the exact pattern: _ A C _ Y  
Letters already ruled out for position 1: R, O, S, E, T, I, N, B, M, H, D, K  
Remaining common consonants for position 1: F, G, L, P, V, W  
For position 4 we still need a letter that hasn’t appeared anywhere else—every unused vowel/consonant left is fine as long as it’s new.

Let’s test F in position 1 and G in position 4, forming FACG Y → “FACGY” isn’t a word, but “FAC**t**y” isn’t valid either…  
A real word that fits _ A C _ Y and uses fresh letters is “LACY” but that’s only four letters.  
Wait—how about “FAC**t**y”? Not valid.  
“P A C **t** Y”? “PATY” isn’t valid.  
“V A C **t** Y”? “VATY” isn’t valid.  
“W A C **t** Y”? “WATY” isn’t valid.  
“F A C **t** Y”? “FACTY” isn’t valid.  
“F A C **k** Y”? “FAKCY” isn’t valid.  
“L A C **t** Y”? “LATY” isn’t valid.  
“L A C **k** Y”? “LACKY” is a real word and uses L and K, neither of which has been tested yet.

So “LACKY” is the logical next guess.
