### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word (with their current positions):
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY: A(✓)).

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- E (because it appeared as (-) in both guesses, meaning it is in the word but not in the positions tried so far: 5 and 1).
- R (because it appeared as (-) in both guesses, meaning it is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _
and must contain E and R somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have tried Y and it was (-), so Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Thus the word must contain: A, E, R, Y and one more letter (unknown yet), with A fixed in position 2.

Current pattern: _ A _ _ _

Letters left to place: E, R, Y plus one new letter.

Let’s try a word that fits: Y A R E _ won’t work (only 4 letters).  
Try Y A _ R E → YARE_ no.  
Try _ A Y R E → AYR E no.

How about placing E in position 1, R in position 4, Y in position 3, and a new consonant in position 5?  
Pattern: E A Y R _  
A valid 5-letter word matching this is EARY_? No.  
Try E A _ R Y → E A ? R Y → EAGRY? Not a word.  
Try A E Y R _? No, A is fixed in position 2.

Better pattern: _ A E R Y → ? A E R Y → MAE RY? Not a word.  
Try _ A R E Y → ? A R E Y → B A R E Y? No.  
Try _ A Y E R → ? A Y E R → D A Y E R? No.  
Try R A Y E _ → R A Y E ? → R A Y E S? No S.  
Try C A R E Y? No, A is fixed in position 2.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for E, R, Y with A fixed at 2:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ A _ _ _

E cannot be 1 or 5 (from feedback), so E must be 3 or 4.  
R cannot be 2 or 3 (from feedback), so R must be 1, 4, or 5.  
Y cannot be 5 (from feedback), so Y must be 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try placing:
- R in 1, E in 3, Y in 4 → R A E Y _ → RAEY? Need a 5th letter.  
  RAEY? Not a word.  
- R in 1, E in 4, Y in 3 → R A Y E _ → RAYE? No.  
- E in 3, R in 4, Y in 1 → Y A E R _ → YAER? No.  
- E in 4, R in 5, Y in 1 → Y A _ E R → YA_ER → YACER? No.  
- E in 4, R in 1, Y in 3 → R A Y E _ → RAYE? No.

Try a different approach: use a word that contains A in position 2, and tests new positions for E, R, Y plus a new consonant.

Consider the word: D A R E Y → but A is fixed at 2, so D A R E Y has A in 2, and tests R in 3 (but R cannot be in 3), so invalid.

Next candidate: B A R E Y → but R is in 3 (invalid).

Try M A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try F A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try C A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try B A Y E R → but A is fixed at 2, so B A Y E R has A in 2, and tests Y in 3, E in 4, R in 5. This seems valid:
B A Y E R → BAY E R → BAY E R is a valid word (as in ""bayer"" or ""bayer"").

But let’s check positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY).
- B is new.
- Y is in position 3 (was in 5 before, now new).
- E is in position 4 (was in 1 and 5 before, now new).
- R is in position 5 (was in 2 and 3 before, now new).

This seems optimal. Let’s go with BAYER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

A valid 5-letter word matching this is EARY_? No.  
Try E A _ R Y → E A ? R Y → EAGRY? Not a word.  
Try A E Y R _? No, A is fixed in position 2.

Better pattern: _ A E R Y → ? A E R Y → MAE RY? Not a word.  
Try _ A R E Y → ? A R E Y → B A R E Y? No.  
Try _ A Y E R → ? A Y E R → D A Y E R? No.  
Try R A Y E _ → R A Y E ? → R A Y E S? No S.  
Try C A R E Y? No, A is fixed in position 2.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for E, R, Y with A fixed at 2:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known: _ A _ _ _

E cannot be 1 or 5 (from feedback), so E must be 3 or 4.  
R cannot be 2 or 3 (from feedback), so R must be 1, 4, or 5.  
Y cannot be 5 (from feedback), so Y must be 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try placing:
- R in 1, E in 3, Y in 4 → R A E Y _ → RAEY? Need a 5th letter.  
  RAEY? Not a word.  
- R in 1, E in 4, Y in 3 → R A Y E _ → RAYE? No.  
- E in 3, R in 4, Y in 1 → Y A E R _ → YAER? No.  
- E in 4, R in 5, Y in 1 → Y A _ E R → YA_ER → YACER? No.  
- E in 4, R in 1, Y in 3 → R A Y E _ → RAYE? No.

Try a different approach: use a word that contains A in position 2, and tests new positions for E, R, Y plus a new consonant.

Consider the word: D A R E Y → but A is fixed at 2, so D A R E Y has A in 2, and tests R in 3 (but R cannot be in 3), so invalid.

Next candidate: B A R E Y → but R is in 3 (invalid).

Try M A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try F A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try C A R E Y → R in 3 (invalid).

Try B A Y E R → but A is fixed at 2, so B A Y E R has A in 2, and tests Y in 3, E in 4, R in 5. This seems valid:
B A Y E R → BAY E R → BAY E R is a valid word (as in ""bayer"" or ""bayer"").

But let’s check positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from EARLY).
- B is new.
- Y is in position 3 (was in 5 before, now new).
- E is in position 4 (was in 1 and 5 before, now new).
- R is in position 5 (was in 2 and 3 before, now new).

This seems optimal. Let’s go with BAYER.

From the three guesses we now have:

Letters that ARE in the word and in their correct positions:
- A is in position 2 (from EARLY and BAYER).
- Y is in position 3 (from BAYER).
- E is in position 4 (from BAYER).

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- R (because it appeared as (-) in AROSE, EARLY, and BAYER).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, L, B.

So the word looks like: _ A Y E _
and must contain R somewhere in positions 1 or 5 (since R cannot be in 2,3,4).

We have only two positions left to fill: 1 and 5, and one of them must be R.

Possible patterns:
1. R A Y E _
2. _ A Y E R

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits either pattern and uses only letters not yet eliminated (no O, S, L, B).

Looking at pattern 1: R A Y E _ → RAYE? needs a 5th letter. The only common word is RAYON, but O is eliminated. RAYES? S is eliminated. RAYED? D is allowed. RAYED is a valid word (past tense of ray).

Looking at pattern 2: _ A Y E R → ?AYER. Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, etc. Valid words: DAYER? No. FAYER? No. GAYER? G is allowed, GAYER is a word (comparative of gay). HAYER? No. MAYER? M is allowed, MAYER is a word (name). NAYER? N is allowed, NAYER is a word (archaic). PAYER? P is allowed, PAYER is a word (one who pays). TAYER? No. WAYER? No.

Between RAYED and GAYER/MAYER/PAYER, RAYED seems more likely as a common word. Let’s check RAYED:
- R in 1 (new position)
- A in 2 (correct)
- Y in 3 (correct)
- E in 4 (correct)
- D in 5 (new letter, not eliminated)

This fits all constraints.
