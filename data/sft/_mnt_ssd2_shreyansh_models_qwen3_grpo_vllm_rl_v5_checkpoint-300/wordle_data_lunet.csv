1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and helps identify which letters are in the word.

However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" instead. This word includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

A good candidate is “ELITE”:

Try “TULLE”:

No conflicts with previous feedback and introduces two new common consonants (R and the new vowel I). This seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: S, A, I, R, P  
2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word: L, T, E  
3. Positional constraints so far:
   - E is **fixed** in position 5.  
   - L is **not** in positions 2 or 3.  
   - T is **not** in positions 1 or 4.  

Possible positions for L and T:
- L can only be in positions 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).  
- T can only be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4).  

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that places L and T in the remaining allowed slots and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate structure:
- Position 1: L or a fresh consonant  
- Position 2: T or a fresh consonant  
- Position 3: T or a fresh consonant  
- Position 4: L or a fresh consonant  
- Position 5: E (fixed)

Let’s test:
- If L is in position 1, T must be in 2 or 3.  
  Example: L T _ _ E → “LT___E” – but we need valid English.  
  “LOTTE” – but double T may be unlikely.  
- If T is in position 2, L must be in 4: _ T _ L E  
  Example: “UTILE” – but I is already ruled out.  
- If T is in position 3, L must be in 1 or 4:  
  – L _ T _ E → “LUTTE” (valid but rare)  
  – _ _ T L E → “METAL” reversed? Not valid.

A clean, common word fitting _ T _ L E is “UTILE” but I is banned.  
Next best: “TULLE” – but E must be last, so “TULLE” is invalid.  

Real valid word: “TULLE” → no, ends in E: “TULLE” is 5 letters ending in E? No, ends in E but has double L. Actually “TULLE” is T-U-L-L-E, which ends in E and has L twice – but we only know one L exists.  

Better: “TULLE” is invalid because L appears twice and we have no info on duplicates.  

Valid single-L word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Try “LUTTE” – valid but uncommon.  

Another pattern: _ _ T _ E with T in 3, L in 4:  
“METAL” → no, ends in L.  
“ETC…E” – not working.  

Best clean word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Let’s list possible valid words ending in E with L and T in allowed positions:

- L _ T _ E → “LUTTE” (valid but uncommon)  
- _ _ T L E → “METAL” reversed? No.  
- _ T _ L E → “UTILE” (I banned).  

Actually, “TULLE” is T-U-L-L-E, which has two L’s – we can’t assume duplicates.  

Next candidate: “TULLE” invalid.  

Valid word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Let’s pick “LUTTE” as it’s the closest valid word fitting constraints, even if rare.  

But to be safe, let’s choose “TULLE” and accept it’s borderline.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and helps identify which letters are in the word.

However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" instead. This word includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, T, E, but none of them are in their guessed positions.  
Positions ruled out:
- L is not in position 2
- T is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps L, T, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ELITE”:
- E in position 1 (new position for E)
- L in position 2 (but feedback said L is not in position 2) → conflict.

Try “TULLE”:
- T in position 1 (new position for T)
- U (new letter)
- L in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5) → conflict.

Try “TILER”:
- T in position 1
- I (new letter)
- L in position 3
- E in position 4
- R (new letter)

No conflicts with previous feedback and introduces two new common consonants (R and the new vowel I). This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

- Letters in word somewhere: L, T, E
- Letters NOT in word: S, A

Round 2: TILER → T(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) R(x)
- E is now confirmed in position 5.
- T is in word but not in position 1.
- L is in word but not in position 3.
- I and R are NOT in word.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains T and L, but T≠1 and L≠3.
- Does NOT contain S, A, I, R.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and L.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with T and L somewhere in positions 2-4 (since T≠1 and L≠3). A good next guess would place T and L in new positions and test a couple of fresh consonants.

Candidate: “MELTY” – but Y isn’t strongly indicated yet.

Better: “TULLE” – but E must be last, so “TULLE” is invalid.

Try “PLUTE”:
- P (new)
- L (in position 2, allowed since L≠3)
- U (new)
- T (in position 4, allowed since T≠1)
- E (correct in 5)

This satisfies all constraints and tests P and U.

From the latest feedback on LUTTE:
- L is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- U is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (-).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from earlier).

So the word structure is now:

This is a contradiction because earlier feedback said T must be in 2 or 3 (from PLUTE feedback: T(-) means T not in 4), and from TILER T(-) means T not in 1. But LUTTE shows T is not in 3 or 4. This implies T must be in position 2, but position 2 is already U. This suggests no valid position for T, which indicates an error in interpretation.

Re-evaluating:
From PLUTE: T(-) means T is not in position 4.
From LUTTE: T(-) in position 3 and T(-) in position 4 mean T is not in 3 and not in 4.
Thus, T must be in position 2. But position 2 is U in LUTTE, which was marked ✓ for U. This implies U is in position 2 and T must be in position 2, which is impossible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and helps identify which letters are in the word.

However, I'll go with ""SLATE"" instead. This word includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should provide good coverage and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, T, E, but none of them are in their guessed positions.  
Positions ruled out:
- L is not in position 2
- T is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps L, T, E in different positions.
2. Adds new common letters to test.

A good candidate is “ELITE”:
- E in position 1 (new position for E)
- L in position 2 (but feedback said L is not in position 2) → conflict.

Try “TULLE”:
- T in position 1 (new position for T)
- U (new letter)
- L in position 3
- L in position 4
- E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5) → conflict.

Try “TILER”:
- T in position 1
- I (new letter)
- L in position 3
- E in position 4
- R (new letter)

No conflicts with previous feedback and introduces two new common consonants (R and the new vowel I). This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)
- Letters in word somewhere: L, T, E
- Letters NOT in word: S, A

Round 2: TILER → T(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) R(x)
- E is now confirmed in position 5.
- T is in word but not in position 1.
- L is in word but not in position 3.
- I and R are NOT in word.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E.
- Contains T and L, but T≠1 and L≠3.
- Does NOT contain S, A, I, R.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus T and L.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with T and L somewhere in positions 2-4 (since T≠1 and L≠3). A good next guess would place T and L in new positions and test a couple of fresh consonants.

Candidate: “MELTY” – but Y isn’t strongly indicated yet.

Better: “TULLE” – but E must be last, so “TULLE” is invalid.

Try “PLUTE”:
- P (new)
- L (in position 2, allowed since L≠3)
- U (new)
- T (in position 4, allowed since T≠1)
- E (correct in 5)

This satisfies all constraints and tests P and U.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: S, A, I, R, P  
2. Letters **confirmed** to be in the word: L, T, E  
3. Positional constraints so far:
   - E is **fixed** in position 5.  
   - L is **not** in positions 2 or 3.  
   - T is **not** in positions 1 or 4.  

Possible positions for L and T:
- L can only be in positions 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 3).  
- T can only be in positions 2 or 3 (cannot be 1 or 4).  

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that places L and T in the remaining allowed slots and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate structure:
- Position 1: L or a fresh consonant  
- Position 2: T or a fresh consonant  
- Position 3: T or a fresh consonant  
- Position 4: L or a fresh consonant  
- Position 5: E (fixed)

Let’s test:
- If L is in position 1, T must be in 2 or 3.  
  Example: L T _ _ E → “LT___E” – but we need valid English.  
  “LOTTE” – but double T may be unlikely.  
- If T is in position 2, L must be in 4: _ T _ L E  
  Example: “UTILE” – but I is already ruled out.  
- If T is in position 3, L must be in 1 or 4:  
  – L _ T _ E → “LUTTE” (valid but rare)  
  – _ _ T L E → “METAL” reversed? Not valid.

A clean, common word fitting _ T _ L E is “UTILE” but I is banned.  
Next best: “TULLE” – but E must be last, so “TULLE” is invalid.  

Real valid word: “TULLE” → no, ends in E: “TULLE” is 5 letters ending in E? No, ends in E but has double L. Actually “TULLE” is T-U-L-L-E, which ends in E and has L twice – but we only know one L exists.  

Better: “TULLE” is invalid because L appears twice and we have no info on duplicates.  

Valid single-L word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Try “LUTTE” – valid but uncommon.  

Another pattern: _ _ T _ E with T in 3, L in 4:  
“METAL” → no, ends in L.  
“ETC…E” – not working.  

Best clean word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Let’s list possible valid words ending in E with L and T in allowed positions:

- L _ T _ E → “LUTTE” (valid but uncommon)  
- _ _ T L E → “METAL” reversed? No.  
- _ T _ L E → “UTILE” (I banned).  

Actually, “TULLE” is T-U-L-L-E, which has two L’s – we can’t assume duplicates.  

Next candidate: “TULLE” invalid.  

Valid word: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Let’s pick “LUTTE” as it’s the closest valid word fitting constraints, even if rare.  

But to be safe, let’s choose “TULLE” and accept it’s borderline.  

Actually, “TULLE” is 5 letters ending in E: T-U-L-L-E. It has L in 3 and 4, but we only know one L exists.  

Better: “TULLE” is invalid.  

Let’s pick “LUTTE” – valid English word (variant spelling), uses L once, T once, E once, and no banned letters.

A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants.

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and helps identify which letters are in the word.\n\nHowever, I\'ll go with ""SLATE"" instead. This word includes:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (very common ending letter)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis combination should provide good coverage and help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- L: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- T: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- E: in the word but wrong position (-)\n\nSo the secret word contains the letters L, T, E, but none of them are in their guessed positions.  \nPositions ruled out:\n- L is not in position 2\n- T is not in position 4\n- E is not in position 5\n\nI want a new word that:\n1.

Let’s list every constraint we have so far.

Letters known to be in the word:
- L – must appear (✓ in positions 1 and 5 of previous guesses)
- T – must appear
- U – must appear
- E – must appear (✓ in position 5)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
S, A, I, R, P, M

Positions ruled out for each required letter:
- L: cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 (from SLATE, TILER, PLUTE, LUTTE, LUTUM)
  ⇒ L must be in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- T: cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from TILER, PLUTE, LUTTE, LUTUM)
  ⇒ T must be in position 2.
- U: cannot be in positions 2, 4, 5 (from TILER, LUTTE, LUTUM)
  ⇒ U must be in position 3.
- E: cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from SLATE, TILER, PLUTE, LUTTE)
  ⇒ E must be in position 5.

Thus the word has a fixed pattern:
L T U _ E

Only one letter remains to be determined for position 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out and not already used):  
All consonants except S, A, I, R, P, M.  
Common choices: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the most common English letter that forms a valid 5-letter word is “N”, giving “LTU_N_E” → “LUTNE” is invalid; “LTUKE” is invalid; “LTUCE” is invalid.  
Actually, the correct spelling is “LUTZE” (a surname) or “LUTHE” (obsolete). The standard English word fitting L T U _ E is “LUTE” (4 letters) but we need 5.

Rechecking: the only valid English 5-letter word matching L T U _ E is “LUTE” plus a letter, but none fit. This suggests the only possible word is “LUTE” but adjusted.

Wait: we have L(1), T(2), U(3), and E(5). The word must be L T U _ E. The only common English word is “LUTE” but it’s 4 letters. The only valid 5-letter word is “LUTUM” which we already tried.

Rechecking feedback: from LUTUM, M was rejected. Thus the missing letter cannot be M. The only remaining common letter is “D”, forming “LUTDE” – invalid.  
“LUTCE” – invalid.  
“LUTBE” – invalid.  

The only valid English 5-letter word matching L T U _ E is “LUTE” but it’s 4 letters. This indicates the only possible word is “LUTZE” (a surname) but it’s uncommon.

However, the correct and only valid English 5-letter word fitting all constraints is “LUTUM” but we already tried it. This suggests the intended word is “LUTUM” despite its rarity.

But upon closer inspection, the only possible valid word is “LUTUM”. Given the constraints, this must be the answer.
