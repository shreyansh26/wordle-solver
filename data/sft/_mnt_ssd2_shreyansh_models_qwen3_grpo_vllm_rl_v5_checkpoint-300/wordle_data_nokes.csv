For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

1. Uses O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5.

- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (not 5).

A good candidate is ""SHEET"":

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SHEET → S(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
   - H and T are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (the second E is correct in position 4).
   - The last E is correct in position 4: E(✓).

So the secret word:
- Contains: O, S, E (with E confirmed in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, H, T.
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SHEET feedback).
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE).

Current known letters:
- Position 4: E
- Letters somewhere: O, S, E (but E is already in position 4, so the other E must appear once more in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4).
- O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5).

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is E.
- We need to place O and S in remaining positions (1,2,3,5) with constraints:
  - S not in 1 or 4 (already), so S in 2,3,5.
  - O not in 3, so O in 1,2,5.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in 2: then O could be 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3: then O could be 1 or 2 or 5.
- If S is in 5: then O could be 1,2.

Let's try ""POSES"":
- P, O, S, E, S.
- But E is in position 4 (✓), so this would have E in 4 and 3, but we only have one E confirmed. Actually, the feedback shows only one E is correct in position 4, so the word might have only one E (position 4), or possibly two E's. The feedback doesn't clarify this, so we should assume one E in position 4 and another E elsewhere if needed.

""POSES"" has two S's and one O, but we don't know if S appears twice. Better to avoid double letters for now.

""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded.
""SONIC"" - C is new, but we need to test more letters.
""POSED"" - D is new, but let's see.

Better approach: use common letters not yet tested. We have not tested I, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""SPOKE"":
- S, P, O, K, E.
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 - but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SHEET feedback). So this is invalid.

""SPOKE"" is invalid because S can't be in position 1.

Next try: ""POSED"":
- P, O, S, E, D.
- E in 4 (✓).
- S in 3 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).
- O in 2 (allowed, since O can be in 1,2,5).
- P and D are new letters to test.
This seems valid.

- Letters somewhere: O, S, E (but E is already in position 4, so the other E must appear once more in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4).
- O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5).

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is E.
- We need to place O and S in remaining positions (1,2,3,5) with constraints:
  - S not in 1 or 4 (already), so S in 2,3,5.
  - O not in 3, so O in 1,2,5.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in 2: then O could be 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3: then O could be 1 or 2 or 5.
- If S is in 5: then O could be 1,2.

Let's try ""POSES"":
- P, O, S, E, S.
- But E is in position 4 (✓), so this would have E in 4 and 3, but we only have one E confirmed. Actually, the feedback shows only one E is correct in position 4, so the word might have only one E (position 4), or possibly two E's. The feedback doesn't clarify this, so we should assume one E in position 4 and another E elsewhere if needed.

""POSES"" has two S's and one O, but we don't know if S appears twice. Better to avoid double letters for now.

""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded.
""SONIC"" - C is new, but we need to test more letters.
""POSED"" - D is new, but let's see.

Better approach: use common letters not yet tested. We have not tested I, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""SPOKE"":
- S, P, O, K, E.
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 - but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SHEET feedback). So this is invalid.

""SPOKE"" is invalid because S can't be in position 1.

Next try: ""POSED"":
- P, O, S, E, D.
- E in 4 (✓).
- S in 3 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).
- O in 2 (allowed, since O can be in 1,2,5).
- P and D are new letters to test.
This seems valid.

""POSED"" is a good third guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5.
2. Does not use A or R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Possible positions for O, S, E:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3).
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (not 5).

A good candidate is ""SHEET"":
- Uses S, E, E, T, H.
- S is in position 1 (new position from 4 in AROSE).
- E appears in positions 2 and 4 (positions 4 and 5 in AROSE were E and S, so these are new positions).
- H and T are new letters to test.
- No A or R.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SHEET → S(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
   - H and T are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (the second E is correct in position 4).
   - The last E is correct in position 4: E(✓).

So the secret word:
- Contains: O, S, E (with E confirmed in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, H, T.
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SHEET feedback).
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE).

Current known letters:
- Position 4: E
- Letters somewhere: O, S, E (but E is already in position 4, so the other E must appear once more in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4).
- O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5).

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is E.
- We need to place O and S in remaining positions (1,2,3,5) with constraints:
  - S not in 1 or 4 (already), so S in 2,3,5.
  - O not in 3, so O in 1,2,5.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in 2: then O could be 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3: then O could be 1 or 2 or 5.
- If S is in 5: then O could be 1,2.

Let's try ""POSES"":
- P, O, S, E, S.
- But E is in position 4 (✓), so this would have E in 4 and 3, but we only have one E confirmed. Actually, the feedback shows only one E is correct in position 4, so the word might have only one E (position 4), or possibly two E's. The feedback doesn't clarify this, so we should assume one E in position 4 and another E elsewhere if needed.

""POSES"" has two S's and one O, but we don't know if S appears twice. Better to avoid double letters for now.

""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded.
""SONIC"" - C is new, but we need to test more letters.
""POSED"" - D is new, but let's see.

Better approach: use common letters not yet tested. We have not tested I, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""SPOKE"":
- S, P, O, K, E.
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 - but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SHEET feedback). So this is invalid.

""SPOKE"" is invalid because S can't be in position 1.

Next try: ""POSED"":
- P, O, S, E, D.
- E in 4 (✓).
- S in 3 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).
- O in 2 (allowed, since O can be in 1,2,5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This gives me maximum information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x).
- O, S, E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters O, S, E (but not in positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A or R.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5.
2. Does not use A or R.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Possible positions for O, S, E:
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (not 3).
- S can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (not 5).

A good candidate is ""SHEET"":
- Uses S, E, E, T, H.
- S is in position 1 (new position from 4 in AROSE).
- E appears in positions 2 and 4 (positions 4 and 5 in AROSE were E and S, so these are new positions).
- H and T are new letters to test.
- No A or R.

This seems like a strong second guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SHEET -> FEEDBACK: S(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - A, R are not in the word.
   - O, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. SHEET → S(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) T(x)
   - H and T are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (the second E is correct in position 4).
   - The last E is correct in position 4: E(✓).

So the secret word:
- Contains: O, S, E (with E confirmed in position 4).
- Does NOT contain: A, R, H, T.
- S is not in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SHEET feedback).
- O is not in position 3 (from AROSE).

Current known letters:
- Position 4: E
- Letters somewhere: O, S, E (but E is already in position 4, so the other E must appear once more in positions 1, 2, or 3).
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4).
- O must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is E, so 1, 2, or 5).

Let's try to construct a word:
- Position 4 is E.
- We need to place O and S in remaining positions (1,2,3,5) with constraints:
  - S not in 1 or 4 (already), so S in 2,3,5.
  - O not in 3, so O in 1,2,5.

Possible combinations:
- If S is in 2: then O could be 1 or 5.
- If S is in 3: then O could be 1 or 2 or 5.
- If S is in 5: then O could be 1,2.

Let's try ""POSES"":
- P, O, S, E, S.
- But E is in position 4 (✓), so this would have E in 4 and 3, but we only have one E confirmed. Actually, the feedback shows only one E is correct in position 4, so the word might have only one E (position 4), or possibly two E's. The feedback doesn't clarify this, so we should assume one E in position 4 and another E elsewhere if needed.

""POSES"" has two S's and one O, but we don't know if S appears twice. Better to avoid double letters for now.

""OCEAN"" - but A is excluded.
""SONIC"" - C is new, but we need to test more letters.
""POSED"" - D is new, but let's see.

Better approach: use common letters not yet tested. We have not tested I, N, L, C, D, etc.

Let's try ""SPOKE"":
- S, P, O, K, E.
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 1 - but feedback says S is not in position 1 (from SHEET feedback). So this is invalid.

""SPOKE"" is invalid because S can't be in position 1.

Next try: ""POSED"":
- P, O, S, E, D.
- E in 4 (✓).
- S in 3 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).
- O in 2 (allowed, since O can be in 1,2,5).
- P and D are new letters to test.
This seems valid.

""POSED"" is a good third guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, H, T, P, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S, E  
Confirmed positions:  
- Position 2 = O  
- Position 4 = E  

Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 5  
Constraints on the remaining letters:  
- S must appear somewhere other than positions 1, 3, 4 (from AROSE and POSED feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 5.  
- Positions 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet tested and not already excluded.  
  Common unused letters still allowed: I, N, L, C, B, G, F, K, M, U, Y, etc.

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ E S

We now need two new distinct letters for positions 1 and 3.  
A common pair that forms a valid word is “C” and “I”, giving “COIES” – but that isn’t a real English word.  
Another common pair is “B” and “I”, giving “BOISE” – also not valid.  
Another pair: “C” and “O” – but O is already used.  
Another pair: “L” and “I” – “LOI_E” doesn’t form a word.  
Another pair: “N” and “I” – “NOISE” is a valid English word and uses only untested letters.

Let’s check:  
N (new), O (fixed), I (new), S (fixed), E (fixed).  
All constraints satisfied.

From the feedback on NOSES we now know:
- N (✓) position 1
- O (✓) position 2
- S (-) position 3 → S is in the word but not in position 3
- E (✓) position 4
- S (✓) position 5

So the only remaining unknown is position 3.  
We already have S confirmed in position 5, so position 3 must be some other letter.

Letters already excluded: A, R, H, T, P, D, I, and now we know S is NOT in position 3.

We need a 5-letter word of the form N O _ E S that is in the dictionary and uses only allowed letters.

Common letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, K, L, M, U, Y, etc.

Scanning valid English words:
- NOBES – not a common word
- NOCES – uncommon
- NOGES – archaic
- NOLES – uncommon
- NOMES – valid (plural of “nome”)
- NOSES – already tried
- NOVES – uncommon
- NOLAN – doesn’t fit

The only common valid word left is NOMES.

Check letters: N, O, M, E, S – none are excluded and all constraints satisfied.
