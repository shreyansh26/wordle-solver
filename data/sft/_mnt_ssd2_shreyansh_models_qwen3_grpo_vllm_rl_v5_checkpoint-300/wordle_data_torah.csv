For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters and can help identify multiple letters early in the game.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere
- Does NOT contain S, L, E
- A is NOT in position 3
- T is NOT in position 4

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and T
2. Avoids S, L, E
3. Puts A and T in different positions than before

Good letters to include next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CARTY (but Y is less common)
- TRAMP (but P is less common)
- TARDY (but Y is less common)
- CRATE (but E is excluded)
- TRAIN (but I is already in word)

Let me try ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded. Next option: ""TRAIN"" - but I is already in word. 

Better option: ""TRAMP"" - but P is less common. 

Another approach: focus on common consonants and vowels. Since A and T are confirmed, and E is out, let's try ""CARTY"" - but Y is uncommon. 

Actually, let's try ""TRAMP"" - it has T and A in new positions, and uses common letters. 

Wait, let's re-evaluate. The word must have A and T, and avoid S, L, E. 

Good candidates:
- TACET (but E is excluded)
- ATROC (but O is less common)
- ARTIC (but C is good)

Let me try ""ARTIC"" - it has A and T, avoids S, L, E, and uses common letters. 

But A is in position 1 now, which is new. T is in position 4, which is new. 

""ARTIC"" seems good.

- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- I and C are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, T, R
- Letters that must NOT appear: S, L, E, I, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3
  – T cannot be in position 3 or 4
  – R cannot be in position 2

We still need a 5-letter word that contains A, T, R and avoids the forbidden letters and positions.  
Let’s list possible positions for A, T, R and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet eliminated (i.e., from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, E, I, C).

Remaining common consonants/vowels: N, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- RATIO – contains I (forbidden)
- ROTOR – contains O (allowed), but R would be in position 1 and 3, which might conflict
- RAPID – contains D and P (allowed), but D and P are new
- TRAIN – contains I (forbidden)
- TARDY – contains D and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- PARTY – contains P and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- THORN – contains H, O, N (allowed), but missing A
- ROUND – missing A
- DRANK – missing T
- PATIO – missing R
- RANCH – missing T
- TURBO – missing A
- HARTS – contains S (forbidden)
- URBAN – contains U, B, N (allowed), but missing T

Let’s try “URBAN” – but it doesn’t contain T.  
Next, “DRANK” – doesn’t contain R.  
“PARTY” – contains P, A, R, T, Y.  
Check positions:
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 3)
- T is in position 4 – allowed (not 3 or 4? Wait, T cannot be in 4 from round 1 feedback. So T in 4 is forbidden. Thus PARTY is invalid.)

Next, “TRAMP” – T in 1, R in 2, A in 3.  
But A cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Next, “TRAIN” – I is forbidden.

Next, “TARDY” – T in 1, A in 2, R in 3.  
Check constraints:
- A not in 1 or 3 – A in 2 is OK  
- T not in 3 or 4 – T in 1 is OK  
- R not in 2 – R in 3 is OK  
Letters used: T, A, R, D, Y – all allowed.

So “TARDY” seems valid.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: T, A, R, D, Y – none of S, L, E, I, C appear.  
Positions:
- T (1): allowed

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these.

1. Uses A and T
2. Avoids S, L, E
3. Puts A and T in different positions than before

Good letters to include next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CARTY (but Y is less common)
- TRAMP (but P is less common)
- TARDY (but Y is less common)
- CRATE (but E is excluded)
- TRAIN (but I is already in word)

Let me try ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded. Next option: ""TRAIN"" - but I is already in word. 

Better option: ""TRAMP"" - but P is less common. 

Another approach: focus on common consonants and vowels. Since A and T are confirmed, and E is out, let's try ""CARTY"" - but Y is uncommon. 

Actually, let's try ""TRAMP"" - it has T and A in new positions, and uses common letters. 

Wait, let's re-evaluate. The word must have A and T, and avoid S, L, E. 

Good candidates:
- TACET (but E is excluded)
- ATROC (but O is less common)
- ARTIC (but C is good)

Let me try ""ARTIC"" - it has A and T, avoids S, L, E, and uses common letters. 

But A is in position 1 now, which is new. T is in position 4, which is new. 

""ARTIC"" seems good.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 (SLATE):
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

Round 2 (ARTIC):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- I and C are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, T, R
- Letters that must NOT appear: S, L, E, I, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3
  – T cannot be in position 3 or 4
  – R cannot be in position 2

We still need a 5-letter word that contains A, T, R and avoids the forbidden letters and positions.  
Let’s list possible positions for A, T, R and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet eliminated (i.e., from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, E, I, C).

Remaining common consonants/vowels: N, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- RATIO – contains I (forbidden)
- ROTOR – contains O (allowed), but R would be in position 1 and 3, which might conflict
- RAPID – contains D and P (allowed), but D and P are new
- TRAIN – contains I (forbidden)
- TARDY – contains D and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- PARTY – contains P and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- THORN – contains H, O, N (allowed), but missing A
- ROUND – missing A
- DRANK – missing T
- PATIO – missing R
- RANCH – missing T
- TURBO – missing A
- HARTS – contains S (forbidden)
- URBAN – contains U, B, N (allowed), but missing T

Let’s try “URBAN” – but it doesn’t contain T.  
Next, “DRANK” – doesn’t contain R.  
“PARTY” – contains P, A, R, T, Y.  
Check positions:
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 3)
- T is in position 4 – allowed (not 3 or 4? Wait, T cannot be in 4 from round 1 feedback. So T in 4 is forbidden. Thus PARTY is invalid.)

Next, “TRAMP” – T in 1, R in 2, A in 3.  
But A cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Next, “TRAIN” – I is forbidden.

Next, “TARDY” – T in 1, A in 2, R in 3.  
Check constraints:
- A not in 1 or 3 – A in 2 is OK  
- T not in 3 or 4 – T in 1 is OK  
- R not in 2 – R in 3 is OK  
Letters used: T, A, R, D, Y – all allowed.

So “TARDY” seems valid.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: T, A, R, D, Y – none of S, L, E, I, C appear.  
Positions:
- T (1): allowed  
- A (2): allowed  
- R (3): allowed  
- D (4): allowed  
- Y (5): allowed  

Thus, “TARDY” is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters and can help identify multiple letters early in the game.

- Letters that must NOT appear: S, L, E, I, C, D, Y
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (from rounds 1, 2, 3)
  – T is fixed at position 1
  – R is fixed at position 3

We still need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with T
2. Has R in position 3
3. Contains A somewhere (positions 4 or 5)
4. Uses only letters not yet excluded (i.e., from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, E, I, C, D, Y)

Remaining common letters: N, O, U, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

Possible patterns: T _ R A _ or T _ R _ A

Let’s list possible words:
- TURAN – contains U, N (allowed), A in 4
- TORAN – but N is allowed, but ""TORAN"" is not a common word
- TURQA – but Q is less common
- TURMA – M is allowed, but ""TURMA"" is not a word
- TURBO – contains B, O (allowed), A in 4
- TURNO – contains N, O (allowed), A in 4
- TURRA – double R is allowed, but A in 4
- TURPA – P is allowed, but ""TURPA"" is not a word

Looking at common English words:
- TURBO (valid word)
- TURAN (valid word, but less common)
- TURNO (valid word)

Let’s try ""TURBO"" – it fits:
- T in 1 (✓)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (✓)
- B in 4 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
And it contains A? No, ""TURBO"" does not contain A. So this is invalid because we know A must be in the word.

Wait, we need A to be in position 4 or 5.

Let me rethink:
We need words that fit T _ R A _ or T _ R _ A.

Looking at valid English words:
- TURAN (T-U-R-A-N) – fits T _ R A _ pattern
- TURQA (but Q is uncommon)
- TURMA (not a word)
- TURPA (not a word)
- TURBO (no A)
- TURNO (T-U-R-N-O) – fits T _ R _ O pattern, but no A

Actually, ""TURAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting T _ R A _ with allowed letters.

Let me verify:
- T in 1 (✓)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (✓)
- A in 4 (must be here or 5)
- N in 5 (allowed)
Letters used: T, U, R, A, N – none of the forbidden letters appear.

Thus, ""TURAN"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices because they contain common letters. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these. ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters and can help identify multiple letters early in the game.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, E are NOT in the word (x)
- A and T are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere
- Does NOT contain S, L, E
- A is NOT in position 3
- T is NOT in position 4

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and T
2. Avoids S, L, E
3. Puts A and T in different positions than before

Good letters to include next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CARTY (but Y is less common)
- TRAMP (but P is less common)
- TARDY (but Y is less common)
- CRATE (but E is excluded)
- TRAIN (but I is already in word)

Let me try ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded. Next option: ""TRAIN"" - but I is already in word. 

Better option: ""TRAMP"" - but P is less common. 

Another approach: focus on common consonants and vowels. Since A and T are confirmed, and E is out, let's try ""CARTY"" - but Y is uncommon. 

Actually, let's try ""TRAMP"" - it has T and A in new positions, and uses common letters. 

Wait, let's re-evaluate. The word must have A and T, and avoid S, L, E. 

Good candidates:
- TACET (but E is excluded)
- ATROC (but O is less common)
- ARTIC (but C is good)

Let me try ""ARTIC"" - it has A and T, avoids S, L, E, and uses common letters.

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- I and C are NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, T, R
- Letters that must NOT appear: S, L, E, I, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 3
  – T cannot be in position 3 or 4
  – R cannot be in position 2

We still need a 5-letter word that contains A, T, R and avoids the forbidden letters and positions.  
Let’s list possible positions for A, T, R and fill the remaining two slots with letters not yet eliminated (i.e., from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, E, I, C).

Remaining common consonants/vowels: N, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- RATIO – contains I (forbidden)
- ROTOR – contains O (allowed), but R would be in position 1 and 3, which might conflict
- RAPID – contains D and P (allowed), but D and P are new
- TRAIN – contains I (forbidden)
- TARDY – contains D and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- PARTY – contains P and Y (allowed), but Y is less common
- THORN – contains H, O, N (allowed), but missing A
- ROUND – missing A
- DRANK – missing T
- PATIO – missing R
- RANCH – missing T
- TURBO – missing A
- HARTS – contains S (forbidden)
- URBAN – contains U, B, N (allowed), but missing T

Let’s try “URBAN” – but it doesn’t contain T.  
Next, “DRANK” – doesn’t contain R.  
“PARTY” – contains P, A, R, T, Y.  
Check positions:
- A is in position 2 – allowed (not 1 or 3)
- T is in position 4 – allowed (not 3 or 4? Wait, T cannot be in 4 from round 1 feedback. So T in 4 is forbidden. Thus PARTY is invalid.)

Next, “TRAMP” – T in 1, R in 2, A in 3.  
But A cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Next, “TRAIN” – I is forbidden.

Next, “TARDY” – T in 1, A in 2, R in 3.  
Check constraints:
- A not in 1 or 3 – A in 2 is OK  
- T not in 3 or 4 – T in 1 is OK  
- R not in 2 – R in 3 is OK  
Letters used: T, A, R, D, Y – all allowed.

So “TARDY” seems valid.

Let me verify no forbidden letters: T, A, R, D, Y – none of S, L, E, I, C appear.  
Positions:
- T (1): allowed  
- A (2): allowed  
- R (3): allowed  
- D (4): allowed  
- Y (5): allowed  

Thus, “TARDY” is a valid next guess.

- TURNO – contains N, O (allowed), A in 4
- TURRA – double R is allowed, but A in 4
- TURPA – P is allowed, but ""TURPA"" is not a word

Looking at common English words:
- TURBO (valid word)
- TURAN (valid word, but less common)
- TURNO (valid word)

Let’s try ""TURBO"" – it fits:
- T in 1 (✓)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (✓)
- B in 4 (allowed)
- O in 5 (allowed)
And it contains A? No, ""TURBO"" does not contain A. So this is invalid because we know A must be in the word.

Wait, we need A to be in position 4 or 5.

Let me rethink:
We need words that fit T _ R A _ or T _ R _ A.

Looking at valid English words:
- TURAN (T-U-R-A-N) – fits T _ R A _ pattern
- TURQA (but Q is uncommon)
- TURMA (not a word)
- TURPA (not a word)
- TURBO (no A)
- TURNO (T-U-R-N-O) – fits T _ R _ O pattern, but no A

Actually, ""TURAN"" seems to be the only valid word fitting T _ R A _ with allowed letters.

Let me verify:
- T in 1 (✓)
- U in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (✓)
- A in 4 (must be here or 5)
- N in 5 (allowed)
Letters used: T, U, R, A, N – none of the forbidden letters appear.

Thus, ""TURAN"" is a valid next guess.

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. R is fixed in position 3 (✓).
3. A is fixed in position 4 (✓).
4. U and N are NOT in the word (x).
5. Forbidden letters so far: S, L, E, I, C, D, Y, U, N.

We still need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T
- Has R in position 3
- Has A in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (i.e., from remaining alphabet excluding S, L, E, I, C, D, Y, U, N)

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, etc.

We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with these remaining letters.

Possible patterns: T _ R A _

Looking for valid English words:
- TGRA_ – no common words
- TFRAB – no
- THRAM – no
- TPMAR – no
- TGRA_ – no
- TGRA_ – no

Wait, let's list possible combinations:
- T B R A B – ""TBRA_B"" – no
- T F R A _ – ""TFRA_""
- T G R A _ – ""TGRA_""
- T H R A _ – ""THRA_""
- T K R A _ – ""TKRA_""
- T M R A _ – ""TMRA_""
- T P R A _ – ""TPRA_""
- T V R A _ – ""TVRA_""
- T W R A _ – ""TWRA_""

Looking at these, the only common word is ""THRAW"" but W is allowed and ""THRAW"" is a valid word meaning to tear or rend.

Let's check:
- T in 1 (✓)
- H in 2 (allowed)
- R in 3 (✓)
- A in 4 (✓)
- W in 5 (allowed)
Letters used: T, H, R, A, W – none of forbidden letters appear.

Thus, ""THRAW"" is a valid next guess.
