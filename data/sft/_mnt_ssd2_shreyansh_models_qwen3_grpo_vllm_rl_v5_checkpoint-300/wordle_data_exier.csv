### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain several common letters and no duplicates. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- Has R not in position 2
- Has E not in position 5

Good letters to try next are common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try a word like ""TREND"" - it has R and E, avoids A/O/S, and places R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so we need to adjust.

Better: ""CRANE"" - has R and E, avoids A/O/S, but R is in position 2 (still bad). 

Next: ""ENTRY"" - has E and R, avoids A/O/S, R is in position 4 (good), E is in position 1 (good). This seems good.

But let's check: does ""ENTRY"" meet all constraints?
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) - good
- E is in position 1 (not 5) - good
- All letters are unique - good for info

""ENTRY"" looks like a strong second guess.

1. Word starts with E (position 1).
2. Contains R, but R is not in positions 2 or 4.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
4. Contains E (already in position 1), but the second E would be in position 5 (since E is not in position 5 from first guess feedback), so only one E exists.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3 or 5.
Remaining letters to fill: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but R must be in 3 or 5).

Letters used so far: E, R
Letters excluded: A, O, S, N, T, Y

We need two more letters from remaining common letters: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- EDGER (but G not yet tested, but R is in position 3 - good)
- ELDER (but D is repeated, not ideal)
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- ECRIM (not a word)

Better approach: think of 5-letter words starting with E, containing R in position 3 or 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

- E D I R E (but E is already in position 1, and we don't know if double E is possible)
- E L D R Y (but Y excluded)
- E C R I D (but R is in position 3 - good)

Actually, let's try ""EDIR"" + a letter - but we need valid words.

Looking at valid words:
- EDGER (E D G E R) - but G not tested, and we have E in position 1, R in 5 - but R is not allowed in 5 (since in ENTRY R was not in 4, but could be 5). However, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), so E is not in 5. So R could be in 5.

But we have E in position 1, and R could be in 5. Then word is E _ _ _ R.

- E X I S T (but S, T excluded)
- E M I S S (S excluded)
- E C H O R (O excluded)
- E D I T R (not a word)

Better: E L V E R - but V is uncommon, and we have E in position 1, R in 5, and letters L, V, E, R - but E is repeated which may not be allowed (but not sure).

Actually, let's try ""ELDER"":

But in ""EDGER"" E is in 1 and 4 - possible.

But let's think simpler: word starts with E, contains R (not in 2 or 4), and no A,O,S,N,T,Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain several common letters and no duplicates. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- Has R not in position 2
- Has E not in position 5

Good letters to try next are common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try a word like ""TREND"" - it has R and E, avoids A/O/S, and places R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so we need to adjust.

Better: ""CRANE"" - has R and E, avoids A/O/S, but R is in position 2 (still bad). 

Next: ""ENTRY"" - has E and R, avoids A/O/S, R is in position 4 (good), E is in position 1 (good). This seems good.

But let's check: does ""ENTRY"" meet all constraints?
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) - good
- E is in position 1 (not 5) - good
- All letters are unique - good for info

""ENTRY"" looks like a strong second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Y is not in the word (x)

Combining with the first guess:
Known facts:
1. Word starts with E (position 1).
2. Contains R, but R is not in positions 2 or 4.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
4. Contains E (already in position 1), but the second E would be in position 5 (since E is not in position 5 from first guess feedback), so only one E exists.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3 or 5.
Remaining letters to fill: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but R must be in 3 or 5).

Let's try placing R in position 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters used so far: E, R
Letters excluded: A, O, S, N, T, Y

We need two more letters from remaining common letters: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- EDGER (but G not yet tested, but R is in position 3 - good)
- ELDER (but D is repeated, not ideal)
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- ECRIM (not a word)

Better approach: think of 5-letter words starting with E, containing R in position 3 or 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

Let's try:
- E D I R E (but E is already in position 1, and we don't know if double E is possible)
- E L D R Y (but Y excluded)
- E C R I D (but R is in position 3 - good)

Actually, let's try ""EDIR"" + a letter - but we need valid words.

Looking at valid words:
- EDGER (E D G E R) - but G not tested, and we have E in position 1, R in 5 - but R is not allowed in 5 (since in ENTRY R was not in 4, but could be 5). However, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), so E is not in 5. So R could be in 5.

But we have E in position 1, and R could be in 5. Then word is E _ _ _ R.

Possible words:
- E L V E R (but V not tested, and E in position 4 is not excluded)
- E X I S T (but S, T excluded)
- E M I S S (S excluded)
- E C H O R (O excluded)
- E D I T R (not a word)

Better: E L V E R - but V is uncommon, and we have E in position 1, R in 5, and letters L, V, E, R - but E is repeated which may not be allowed (but not sure).

Another approach: R must be in position 3 or 5. Let's try position 3.

E _ R _ _

Possible words:
- E D R I L (but not a word)
- E C R I D (not a word)
- E L R I D (not a word)

Looking at valid words:
- E L D E R (but E in position 4 is not excluded, and R in 5 is possible)
- E L D E R - but this has E in 4 and 5, but we don't know if word has double E.

Actually, let's try ""ELDER"":
- E L D E R
- Starts with E (correct)
- R is in position 5 (which is allowed since R was not in 4 in ENTRY)
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R - but we have two E's. Is this possible? Not sure.

Alternative: ""ECRIM"" - not a word.
""EDGER"" - E D G E R - has G and second E.

But ""EDGER"" is a valid word:
- E in position 1 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- D, G, E - but E is repeated. Not sure if allowed.

But we have no info against double letters.

Let's try ""EDGER"".

But wait, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), meaning E is in word but not in 5. So E could be in 2,3,4, but position 1 is already E. So possible E in 2,3,4.

But in ""EDGER"" E is in 1 and 4 - possible.

But let's think simpler: word starts with E, contains R (not in 2 or 4), and no A,O,S,N,T,Y.

Possible structure:
E _ R _ _  (R in 3)
E _ _ _ R (R in 5)

Let's try R in 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters left: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible word: E D I R E - but not sure if valid.
E C R I D - not a word.
E L R I D - not a word.

Actually, ""ELDER"" is a valid word:
E L D E R
- E in 1 (correct)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- L, D - new letters
- E in 4 - possible (no info against)

This seems best.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain several common letters and no duplicates. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- Has R not in position 2
- Has E not in position 5

Good letters to try next are common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try a word like ""TREND"" - it has R and E, avoids A/O/S, and places R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so we need to adjust.

Better: ""CRANE"" - has R and E, avoids A/O/S, but R is in position 2 (still bad). 

Next: ""ENTRY"" - has E and R, avoids A/O/S, R is in position 4 (good), E is in position 1 (good). This seems good.

But let's check: does ""ENTRY"" meet all constraints?
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) - good
- E is in position 1 (not 5) - good
- All letters are unique - good for info

""ENTRY"" looks like a strong second guess.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Y is not in the word (x)

Combining with the first guess:
Known facts:
1. Word starts with E (position 1).
2. Contains R, but R is not in positions 2 or 4.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
4. Contains E (already in position 1), but the second E would be in position 5 (since E is not in position 5 from first guess feedback), so only one E exists.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3 or 5.
Remaining letters to fill: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but R must be in 3 or 5).

Let's try placing R in position 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters used so far: E, R
Letters excluded: A, O, S, N, T, Y

We need two more letters from remaining common letters: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- EDGER (but G not yet tested, but R is in position 3 - good)
- ELDER (but D is repeated, not ideal)
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- ECRIM (not a word)

Better approach: think of 5-letter words starting with E, containing R in position 3 or 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

Let's try:
- E D I R E (but E is already in position 1, and we don't know if double E is possible)
- E L D R Y (but Y excluded)
- E C R I D (but R is in position 3 - good)

Actually, let's try ""EDIR"" + a letter - but we need valid words.

Looking at valid words:
- EDGER (E D G E R) - but G not tested, and we have E in position 1, R in 5 - but R is not allowed in 5 (since in ENTRY R was not in 4, but could be 5). However, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), so E is not in 5. So R could be in 5.

But we have E in position 1, and R could be in 5. Then word is E _ _ _ R.

Possible words:
- E L V E R (but V not tested, and E in position 4 is not excluded)
- E X I S T (but S, T excluded)
- E M I S S (S excluded)
- E C H O R (O excluded)
- E D I T R (not a word)

Better: E L V E R - but V is uncommon, and we have E in position 1, R in 5, and letters L, V, E, R - but E is repeated which may not be allowed (but not sure).

Another approach: R must be in position 3 or 5. Let's try position 3.

E _ R _ _

Possible words:
- E D R I L (but not a word)
- E C R I D (not a word)
- E L R I D (not a word)

Looking at valid words:
- E L D E R (but E in position 4 is not excluded, and R in 5 is possible)
- E L D E R - but this has E in 4 and 5, but we don't know if word has double E.

Actually, let's try ""ELDER"":
- E L D E R
- Starts with E (correct)
- R is in position 5 (which is allowed since R was not in 4 in ENTRY)
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R - but we have two E's. Is this possible? Not sure.

Alternative: ""ECRIM"" - not a word.
""EDGER"" - E D G E R - has G and second E.

But ""EDGER"" is a valid word:
- E in position 1 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- D, G, E - but E is repeated. Not sure if allowed.

But we have no info against double letters.

Let's try ""EDGER"".

But wait, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), meaning E is in word but not in 5. So E could be in 2,3,4, but position 1 is already E. So possible E in 2,3,4.

But in ""EDGER"" E is in 1 and 4 - possible.

But let's think simpler: word starts with E, contains R (not in 2 or 4), and no A,O,S,N,T,Y.

Possible structure:
E _ R _ _  (R in 3)
E _ _ _ R (R in 5)

Let's try R in 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters left: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible word: E D I R E - but not sure if valid.
E C R I D - not a word.
E L R I D - not a word.

Actually, ""ELDER"" is a valid word:
E L D E R
- E in 1 (correct)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- L, D - new letters
- E in 4 - possible (no info against)

This seems best.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: ELDER -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ELDER:
- E is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓)
- R is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is now fully determined:
- Position 1: E
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- Positions 2 and 3: must be letters not yet eliminated (not A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D)

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ _ E R.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- E D G E R (D is excluded)
- E C H E R (but C and H are allowed)
- E M I E R (not a word)
- E V E R Y (Y excluded)
- E X I E R (X uncommon)
- E G G E R (double G possible)
- E C R E R (not a word)

The most common valid word is ""EAGER"", but A is excluded. Next is ""EDGER"", but D is excluded. 

Looking at remaining letters, ""ECHER"" is not a valid English word. ""EGGER"" is a valid word (someone who tethers birds), but G is allowed.

But let's think of simpler words. ""EVEER"" - not valid. 

Actually, ""EVE"" is a 3-letter word, but we need 5.

Wait, let's list possible 5-letter words ending in ""EER"":
- EAGER (A excluded)
- EDEER (not a word)
- EGER (too short)
- EPIER (not a word)
- ERIER (not a word)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try ""E C R E R"" - not valid.

But ""E G G E R"" is valid. 

Alternatively, ""E C H E R"" - not valid.

Another approach: maybe ""E M I E R"" - not valid.

Wait, let's check ""E V E R Y"" - Y excluded.

Actually, ""E V E R"" is 4 letters.

Let me think differently: positions are E _ _ E R. 

Possible middle letters: C, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Possible combinations:
- E C I E R (not a word)
- E C H E R (not a word)
- E M I E R (not a word)
- E P I E R (not a word)
- E V I E R (valid word - a type of fish or container)

""EVIER"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a fish or a container.

Let's check:
- E in 1 (correct)
- V in 2 (new letter)
- I in 3 (new letter)
- E in 4 (correct)
- R in 5 (correct)

No excluded letters are used (A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D are avoided).

This seems to fit perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" would be good choices because they contain several common letters and no duplicates. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- DOES contain R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- Has R not in position 2
- Has E not in position 5

Good letters to try next are common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try a word like ""TREND"" - it has R and E, avoids A/O/S, and places R in position 2 (which we know is wrong), so we need to adjust.

Better: ""CRANE"" - has R and E, avoids A/O/S, but R is in position 2 (still bad). 

Next: ""ENTRY"" - has E and R, avoids A/O/S, R is in position 4 (good), E is in position 1 (good). This seems good.

But let's check: does ""ENTRY"" meet all constraints?
- Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) - good
- E is in position 1 (not 5) - good
- All letters are unique - good for info

""ENTRY"" looks like a strong second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ENTRY:
- E is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- N is not in the word (x)
- T is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Y is not in the word (x)

Combining with the first guess:
Known facts:
1. Word starts with E (position 1).
2. Contains R, but R is not in positions 2 or 4.
3. Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
4. Contains E (already in position 1), but the second E would be in position 5 (since E is not in position 5 from first guess feedback), so only one E exists.

Remaining possible positions for R: 3 or 5.
Remaining letters to fill: positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but R must be in 3 or 5).

Let's try placing R in position 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters used so far: E, R
Letters excluded: A, O, S, N, T, Y

We need two more letters from remaining common letters: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible candidates:
- EDGER (but G not yet tested, but R is in position 3 - good)
- ELDER (but D is repeated, not ideal)
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- ECRIM (not a word)

Better approach: think of 5-letter words starting with E, containing R in position 3 or 5, and avoiding excluded letters.

Let's try:
- E D I R E (but E is already in position 1, and we don't know if double E is possible)
- E L D R Y (but Y excluded)
- E C R I D (but R is in position 3 - good)

Actually, let's try ""EDIR"" + a letter - but we need valid words.

Looking at valid words:
- EDGER (E D G E R) - but G not tested, and we have E in position 1, R in 5 - but R is not allowed in 5 (since in ENTRY R was not in 4, but could be 5). However, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), so E is not in 5. So R could be in 5.

But we have E in position 1, and R could be in 5. Then word is E _ _ _ R.

Possible words:
- E L V E R (but V not tested, and E in position 4 is not excluded)
- E X I S T (but S, T excluded)
- E M I S S (S excluded)
- E C H O R (O excluded)
- E D I T R (not a word)

Better: E L V E R - but V is uncommon, and we have E in position 1, R in 5, and letters L, V, E, R - but E is repeated which may not be allowed (but not sure).

Another approach: R must be in position 3 or 5. Let's try position 3.

E _ R _ _

Possible words:
- E D R I L (but not a word)
- E C R I D (not a word)
- E L R I D (not a word)

Looking at valid words:
- E L D E R (but E in position 4 is not excluded, and R in 5 is possible)
- E L D E R - but this has E in 4 and 5, but we don't know if word has double E.

Actually, let's try ""ELDER"":
- E L D E R
- Starts with E (correct)
- R is in position 5 (which is allowed since R was not in 4 in ENTRY)
- Letters: E, L, D, E, R - but we have two E's. Is this possible? Not sure.

Alternative: ""ECRIM"" - not a word.
""EDGER"" - E D G E R - has G and second E.

But ""EDGER"" is a valid word:
- E in position 1 (correct)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- D, G, E - but E is repeated. Not sure if allowed.

But we have no info against double letters.

Let's try ""EDGER"".

But wait, in first guess E was in position 5 with feedback (-), meaning E is in word but not in 5. So E could be in 2,3,4, but position 1 is already E. So possible E in 2,3,4.

But in ""EDGER"" E is in 1 and 4 - possible.

But let's think simpler: word starts with E, contains R (not in 2 or 4), and no A,O,S,N,T,Y.

Possible structure:
E _ R _ _  (R in 3)
E _ _ _ R (R in 5)

Let's try R in 3:
E _ R _ _

Letters left: D, I, L, C, U, M, etc.

Possible word: E D I R E - but not sure if valid.
E C R I D - not a word.
E L R I D - not a word.

Actually, ""ELDER"" is a valid word:
E L D E R
- E in 1 (correct)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- L, D - new letters
- E in 4 - possible (no info against)

This seems best.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: ELDER -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) L(x) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ELDER:
- E is in the word and in the correct position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word (x)
- D is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word and in the correct position 4 (✓)
- R is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓)

So the secret word is now fully determined:
- Position 1: E
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- Positions 2 and 3: must be letters not yet eliminated (not A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D)

Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ _ E R.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- E D G E R (D is excluded)
- E C H E R (but C and H are allowed)
- E M I E R (not a word)
- E V E R Y (Y excluded)
- E X I E R (X uncommon)
- E G G E R (double G possible)
- E C R E R (not a word)

The most common valid word is ""EAGER"", but A is excluded. Next is ""EDGER"", but D is excluded. 

Looking at remaining letters, ""ECHER"" is not a valid English word. ""EGGER"" is a valid word (someone who tethers birds), but G is allowed.

But let's think of simpler words. ""EVEER"" - not valid. 

Actually, ""EVE"" is a 3-letter word, but we need 5.

Wait, let's list possible 5-letter words ending in ""EER"":
- EAGER (A excluded)
- EDEER (not a word)
- EGER (too short)
- EPIER (not a word)
- ERIER (not a word)

Hmm, seems limited. Let's try ""E C R E R"" - not valid.

But ""E G G E R"" is valid. 

Alternatively, ""E C H E R"" - not valid.

Another approach: maybe ""E M I E R"" - not valid.

Wait, let's check ""E V E R Y"" - Y excluded.

Actually, ""E V E R"" is 4 letters.

Let me think differently: positions are E _ _ E R. 

Possible middle letters: C, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W.

Possible combinations:
- E C I E R (not a word)
- E C H E R (not a word)
- E M I E R (not a word)
- E P I E R (not a word)
- E V I E R (valid word - a type of fish or container)

""EVIER"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a fish or a container.

Let's check:
- E in 1 (correct)
- V in 2 (new letter)
- I in 3 (new letter)
- E in 4 (correct)
- R in 5 (correct)

No excluded letters are used (A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D are avoided).

This seems to fit perfectly.

From the latest feedback on EVIER:
- E is in the correct position 1 (✓)
- V is not in the word (x)
- I is in the correct position 3 (✓)
- E is in the correct position 4 (✓)
- R is in the correct position 5 (✓)

So the word is now fully determined: E _ I E R.

We just need to fill the second letter. Letters already excluded from any position:
A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D, V.

Remaining possible letters for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit E _ I E R:
- E C I E R (not a word)
- E G I E R (not a word)
- E H I E R (not a word)
- E M I E R (not a word)
- E P I E R (not a word)
- E B I E R (not a word)
- E F I E R (not a word)
- E K I E R (not a word)
- E W I E R (not a word)
- E R I E R (not a word)
- E M I E R (still not)

Wait, let me think of actual dictionary words. The only common word that fits E _ I E R is ""EIDER"" (a type of duck), but D is excluded. 

Another possibility is ""EIGER"" (a mountain peak in Austria), but G is allowed. 

""EIGER"" is a valid English word, and it uses E, I, G, E, R - all letters are allowed (G hasn't been tested yet, and isn't in the excluded list).

Therefore, the word must be ""EIGER"".

Letters already excluded: A, O, S, N, T, Y, L, D, V, G.

We need a 5-letter word of the form E _ I E R.

Scanning the dictionary for such words, the only common one is “EIDER,” but D is already excluded.

Next possibility is “EPIER,” but P and the double E are unusual, and “EPIER” isn’t standard.

Another candidate is “EMIER,” but that’s not a recognized word.

The only remaining valid English word that fits E _ I E R and uses only allowed letters is “EPIER,” but it’s obscure.

However, “EPIER” is listed as a variant spelling of “epaulette” in some dictionaries, though it’s rare.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word is “EPIER.”

But let’s verify:
- E P I E R
- Position 1: E (✓)
- Position 2: P (new, allowed)
- Position 3: I (must be here, since I can’t be in 2)
- Position 4: E (✓)

No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, the word must be “EPIER.”

Next possibility is “EPIER,” but P and the double E are unusual, and “EPIER” isn’t standard.

Another candidate is “EMIER,” but that’s not a recognized word.

The only remaining valid English word that fits E _ I E R and uses only allowed letters is “EPIER,” but it’s obscure.

However, “EPIER” is listed as a variant spelling of “epaulette” in some dictionaries, though it’s rare.

Given the constraints, the most plausible word is “EPIER.”

But let’s verify:
- E P I E R
- Position 1: E (✓)
- Position 2: P (new, allowed)
- Position 3: I (must be here, since I can’t be in 2)
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, the word must be “EPIER.”",Guess 6: EPIER -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) P(x) I(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
