### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular choices among players include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

- N and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

- DOES contain N and E, but neither is in the 4th or 5th positions respectively

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Avoids C, R, A

3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good remaining common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let's try a word that places N and E in different positions and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters
- N is in position 2 (was in position 4)
- E is in position 5 (was in position 5 - but this is the same position, so this is bad)

Let's synthesize what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: N, E, I  
Positions we have ruled out for these letters:

- N cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or position 2 (from INSET) – so N ≠ 2  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from INSET) – so E ≠ 4, 5  
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INSET) – so I ≠ 1  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N, E, I  
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, S, T  
3. Places N somewhere other than position 2  
4. Places E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5  
5. Places I somewhere other than position 1  

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A promising pattern is _ _ _ _ _ with N, E, I distributed appropriately.

Consider the word “BLIND”:
- Contains B, L, I, N, D  
- Contains I, N (but not E) – misses E, so invalid.

Consider “UNION”:
- Contains U, N, I, O – misses E, so invalid.

Consider “MINEY”:
- Contains M, I, N, E, Y  
  - I is in position 2 (allowed)  
  - N is in position 3 (allowed)  
  - E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4) – invalid.

Consider “PINEY”:
- P, I, N, E, Y  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 (invalid again) – same problem.

We need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try “ENEMY”:
- E, N, E, M, Y  
- Contains E twice – acceptable, but only one N – misses I, so invalid.

Try “INLET”:
- Contains T (forbidden) – invalid.

Try “ULNIE”:
- Not a valid English word.

Try “LINED”:
- L, I, N, E, D  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 (invalid) – again E in 4.

Try “BINGE”:
- B, I, N, G, E  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 5 (invalid) – E in 5 is forbidden.

Try “DINGE”:
- D, I, N, G, E – same issue as above.

Try “HINNE”:
- Not a valid word.

Try “KNEEL”:
- K, N, E, E, L – misses I.

Try “ELGIN”:
- E, L, G, I, N  
  - E in 1 (allowed)  
  - I in 4 (allowed)  
  - N in 5 (allowed)  
  - Letters used: E, L, G, I, N – none of C, R, A, S, T  
This looks valid.

Let’s check:
- Contains N, E, I  
- N not in 2 (it’s in 5) – ok  
- E not in 4 or 5 (it’s in 1) – ok  
- I not in 1 (it’s in 4) – ok

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular choices among players include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

2. Includes N and E somewhere other than positions 4 and 5
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good remaining common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let's try a word that places N and E in different positions and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- S, T, O are new letters
- N is in position 2 (was in position 4)
- E is in position 5 (was in position 5 - but this is the same position, so this is bad)

Oops, E can't stay in position 5. Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E
- N is in position 2 (was 4)
- E is in position 5 (still 5 - same problem)

Try ""INSET"":
- I, N, S, E, T
- N is position 2 (was 4)
- E is position 4 (was 5)
- This looks good

Let's go with INSET.

Let's synthesize what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, S, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: N, E, I  
Positions we have ruled out for these letters:

- N cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE) or position 2 (from INSET) – so N ≠ 2  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from INSET) – so E ≠ 4, 5  
- I cannot be in position 1 (from INSET) – so I ≠ 1  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N, E, I  
2. Does NOT contain C, R, A, S, T  
3. Places N somewhere other than position 2  
4. Places E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5  
5. Places I somewhere other than position 1  

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, O, U, M, P, B, G, H, K, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A promising pattern is _ _ _ _ _ with N, E, I distributed appropriately.

Consider the word “BLIND”:
- Contains B, L, I, N, D  
- Contains I, N (but not E) – misses E, so invalid.

Consider “UNION”:
- Contains U, N, I, O – misses E, so invalid.

Consider “MINEY”:
- Contains M, I, N, E, Y  
  - I is in position 2 (allowed)  
  - N is in position 3 (allowed)  
  - E is in position 4 (but E cannot be in 4) – invalid.

Consider “PINEY”:
- P, I, N, E, Y  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 (invalid again) – same problem.

We need E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try “ENEMY”:
- E, N, E, M, Y  
- Contains E twice – acceptable, but only one N – misses I, so invalid.

Try “INLET”:
- Contains T (forbidden) – invalid.

Try “ULNIE”:
- Not a valid English word.

Try “LINED”:
- L, I, N, E, D  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 (invalid) – again E in 4.

Try “BINGE”:
- B, I, N, G, E  
  - I in 2, N in 3, E in 5 (invalid) – E in 5 is forbidden.

Try “DINGE”:
- D, I, N, G, E – same issue as above.

Try “HINNE”:
- Not a valid word.

Try “KNEEL”:
- K, N, E, E, L – misses I.

Try “ELGIN”:
- E, L, G, I, N  
  - E in 1 (allowed)  
  - I in 4 (allowed)  
  - N in 5 (allowed)  
  - Letters used: E, L, G, I, N – none of C, R, A, S, T  
This looks valid.

Let’s check:
- Contains N, E, I  
- N not in 2 (it’s in 5) – ok  
- E not in 4 or 5 (it’s in 1) – ok  
- I not in 1 (it’s in 4) – ok  
- No C, R, A, S, T – ok  

Therefore, ELGIN is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on ELGIN:

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(✓) – L is correct in position 2  
G(x) – G is NOT in the word  
I(✓) – I is correct in position 4  
N(✓) – N is correct in position 5  

So the secret word is:
- 5 letters long  
- Pattern: _ L _ I N  
- Must contain E somewhere other than position 1  
- Cannot contain C, R, A, S, T, G  

We need a letter for position 3 that:
- is a valid English word when combined with _ L _ I N  
- is not any of the forbidden letters  
- the remaining letter (position 1) must be a valid letter that allows the whole word to be valid  

Possible position 3 letters: common remaining consonants like B, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid English words fitting _ L _ I N:

- BLAIN – not common  
- CLING – contains C (forbidden)  
- FLING – contains F, but G is forbidden, so no  
- PLAIN – contains A (forbidden)  
- SLAIN – contains S (forbidden)  
- ULNIN – not a word  
- ULTIM – not a word  
- ULVIN – not a word  
- ULNID – not a word  

Wait, let’s systematically check:

We have: ? L ? I N

Possible letters for position 3 (middle letter) that are allowed: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Try B: _ L B I N → BLBIN – not a word  
Try D: _ L D I N → LDLIN – not a word  
Try F: _ L F I N → FLFIN – not a word  
Try H: _ L H I N → HLHIN – not a word  
Try K: _ L K I N → KLKIN – not a word  
Try M: _ L M I N → LLMIN – not a word  
Try P: _ L P I N → LLPIN – not a word  
Try U: _ L U I N → L U I N – but that’s 4 letters  
Wait, we need a 5-letter word: ? L U I N – like FLUIN? No.  
Try Y: _ L Y I N → LYIN_ – not a word  

Hmm, let’s think differently: maybe the middle letter is E? But E is already known to be in the word and can’t be in position 1, but could it be in position 3?

So pattern: ? L E I N  
We need a valid 5-letter word: ? L E I N  

Possible first letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Check:
- BL E I N → BLEIN – not a word  
- CL E I N → CLEIN – not a word (but C is forbidden)  
- FL E I N → FLEIN – not a word  
- PL E I N → PLEIN – yes, “plein” is an English word (archaic but accepted)  
- SL E I N – S is forbidden  
- UL E I N – not a word  

So the only viable candidate is PLEIN.

Let’s verify:
- Pattern: P L E I N  
- Contains E in position 3 (allowed)  
- Contains L in 2, I in 4, N in 5 – matches feedback  
- No C, R, A, S, T, G – matches constraints  
- P is a new letter to test – acceptable  

Therefore, PLEIN is the correct next guess.
