For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words contain common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid word and covers a good range of possibilities

This should give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Common vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already in).

A good next word should incorporate O in a different position and use new common letters. ""POINT"" is a strong candidate:
- P, I, N, T are all common and haven't been tested yet.
- O is moved to position 2 (previously position 3).
- No A, R, S, E are used.

Other options like ""CLOUD"", ""MOUNT"", ""BUILT"" are also possible, but ""POINT"" seems balanced with common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)

   – I and N are now known to be in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – P and T are not in the word at all.

Known facts so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, I, N  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

- Contains O, I, N  
- Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- Places I somewhere other than position 3  
- Places N somewhere other than position 4  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, T)

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N.

A good next probe is “IONIC”:
- Contains I, O, N (all required).  
- O is in position 2 – but we already know O is not in position 2 from POINT. So “IONIC” is invalid.

Next try “COBNI” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.  
- O is in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “DINOS” – but S is ruled out.

Try “MOUND”:
- Contains M, O, U, N, D.  
- Has O (position 2 – invalid again).

We need O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s build a word with O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _  
We need I and N in the remaining slots (1,2,3,5), avoiding their forbidden positions:
  – I cannot be in position 3.  
  – N cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied).

A valid word: “UNION” – but it has two N’s, and we don’t know if the word has duplicates.

Another: “MINOR” – but R is ruled out.

Another: “MOUND” – O in position 2, invalid.

Another: “DONIC” – O in position 2, invalid.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words contain common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid word and covers a good range of possibilities

This should give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – O is again marked “-” (wrong position), so it is not in position 2 either.  
   – I and N are now known to be in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – P and T are not in the word at all.

Known facts so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, I, N  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, I, N  
- Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- Places I somewhere other than position 3  
- Places N somewhere other than position 4  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, T)

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N.

A good next probe is “IONIC”:
- Contains I, O, N (all required).  
- O is in position 2 – but we already know O is not in position 2 from POINT. So “IONIC” is invalid.

Next try “COBNI” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.  
- O is in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “DINOS” – but S is ruled out.

Try “MOUND”:
- Contains M, O, U, N, D.  
- Has O (position 2 – invalid again).

We need O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s build a word with O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _  
We need I and N in the remaining slots (1,2,3,5), avoiding their forbidden positions:
  – I cannot be in position 3.  
  – N cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied).

A valid word: “UNION” – but it has two N’s, and we don’t know if the word has duplicates.

Another: “MINOR” – but R is ruled out.

Another: “MOUND” – O in position 2, invalid.

Another: “DONIC” – O in position 2, invalid.

Another: “BINGO” – O in position 5, I in position 2, N in position 3.  
Check constraints:
  – O is in position 5 (allowed).  
  – I is in position 2 (allowed).  
  – N is in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Letters used: B, I, N, G, O – none of A, R, S, E, P, T.  
  – “BINGO” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, “BINGO” is a good next guess.

   – O is now fixed in position 5.  
   – G is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).  
   – B is not in the word.

So the secret word has the form:
- Position 1: unknown  
- Position 2: I (✓)  
- Position 3: N (✓)  
- Position 4: must be G (since G is in the word but not in position 4, and all other letters are ruled out)  
- Position 5: O (✓)

Thus the word must be: _ I N G O

The only common 5-letter English word that fits is “INGOT”.

Let’s verify:
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  
- G is in position 4 (but feedback said G is in the word but not in position 4).  
  – Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Re-examining Guess 3 (BINGO):
- B(x) – B is not in the word.  
- I(✓) – I is in the correct position (position 2).  
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position (position 3).  
- G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 4.  
- O(✓) – O is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word must be: _ I N _ O  
And G must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (but not 4, since it was marked “-” in position 4). Therefore G must be in position 1.

Hence the word is G I N G O.

“GINGO” is a valid 5-letter English word (a variant spelling of “jingling” or a game). However, it’s less common. The more common word is “INGOT”, but that would require G in position 4, which was ruled out.

Therefore the only possible word is “GINGO”.

But let me double-check: is there another word that fits _ I N _ O with G somewhere else?  
No, because G must be in position 1 (the only remaining spot), giving “GINGO”.

Thus, the next guess should be “GINGO”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words contain common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid word and covers a good range of possibilities

This should give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common remaining consonants: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Common vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already in).

A good next word should incorporate O in a different position and use new common letters. ""POINT"" is a strong candidate:
- P, I, N, T are all common and haven't been tested yet.
- O is moved to position 2 (previously position 3).
- No A, R, S, E are used.

Other options like ""CLOUD"", ""MOUNT"", ""BUILT"" are also possible, but ""POINT"" seems balanced with common letters.

From Guess 4 (GINGO) we now have:

N(✓) – N is correct in position 3.  
G(-) – G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (which we already knew).  
O(✓) – O is correct in position 5.

So the word is now fully determined: G I N _ O.

The only letter left is position 4.  
We know from earlier that G is already used in position 1, and we have ruled out A, R, S, E, P, T, B, and now position 4 cannot be G (because the second G in GINGO was marked “-”).  
Other letters already excluded: A, R, S, E, P, T, B.

Valid remaining letters for position 4 (from the alphabet minus all excluded letters): C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English 5-letter word that fits G I N _ O is “GINGO”, but we already tried that and got “-” for the second G.  
Next possible word: “GINKO” – a valid brand name / variant spelling, but not standard.

Wait – let me re-examine the exclusions carefully.

Letters we have ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, T, B.  
Letters we know must be present: G (position 1), I (position 2), N (position 3), O (position 5).  
Therefore position 4 must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out.  
The only common word left is “GINKO”, but it’s not in most dictionaries.

Rechecking: is there any other standard word?  
“GINKO” is actually recognized by some dictionaries as a variant of “gingko” (the tree).  
Given the constraints, “GINKO” is the only possible word left.

But let me think again – perhaps I missed a letter.  
Looking at the alphabet: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The only one that forms a valid word is “GINKO”.

Therefore, the next guess must be “GINKO”.

However, since we have only one guess left (this is Guess 5), and the word must be G I N _ O, and the only valid word fitting is “GINKO”, we must guess it.

But wait – let me confirm “GINKO” is acceptable. Yes, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of “gingko” (the tree). Given the constraints, this is the only possible word left.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. These words contain common vowels and consonants.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid word and covers a good range of possibilities

This should give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes O (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common remaining consonants: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, H, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Common vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already in).

A good next word should incorporate O in a different position and use new common letters. ""POINT"" is a strong candidate:
- P, I, N, T are all common and haven't been tested yet.
- O is moved to position 2 (previously position 3).
- No A, R, S, E are used.

Other options like ""CLOUD"", ""MOUNT"", ""BUILT"" are also possible, but ""POINT"" seems balanced with common letters.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – O is again marked “-” (wrong position), so it is not in position 2 either.  
   – I and N are now known to be in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – P and T are not in the word at all.

Known facts so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, I, N  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.  
- I cannot be in position 3.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains O, I, N  
- Places O in positions 1, 4, or 5  
- Places I somewhere other than position 3  
- Places N somewhere other than position 4  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, E, P, T)

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known O, I, N.

A good next probe is “IONIC”:
- Contains I, O, N (all required).  
- O is in position 2 – but we already know O is not in position 2 from POINT. So “IONIC” is invalid.

Next try “COBNI” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.  
- O is in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “DINOS” – but S is ruled out.

Try “MOUND”:
- Contains M, O, U, N, D.  
- Has O (position 2 – invalid again).

We need O in position 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s build a word with O in position 4:
- _ _ _ O _  
We need I and N in the remaining slots (1,2,3,5), avoiding their forbidden positions:
  – I cannot be in position 3.  
  – N cannot be in position 4 (already satisfied).

A valid word: “UNION” – but it has two N’s, and we don’t know if the word has duplicates.

Another: “MINOR” – but R is ruled out.

Another: “MOUND” – O in position 2, invalid.

Another: “DONIC” – O in position 2, invalid.

Another: “BINGO” – O in position 5, I in position 2, N in position 3.  
Check constraints:
  – O is in position 5 (allowed).  
  – I is in position 2 (allowed).  
  – N is in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Letters used: B, I, N, G, O – none of A, R, S, E, P, T.  
  – “BINGO” is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, “BINGO” is a good next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) T(x)  
   – O is again marked “-”, so it is not in position 2 either.  
   – I and N are now known to be in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – P and T are not in the word at all.

3. BINGO → B(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(-) O(✓)  
   – I is now fixed in position 2.  
   – N is now fixed in position 3.  
   – O is now fixed in position 5.  
   – G is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).  
   – B is not in the word.

So the secret word has the form:
- Position 1: unknown  
- Position 2: I (✓)  
- Position 3: N (✓)  
- Position 4: must be G (since G is in the word but not in position 4, and all other letters are ruled out)  
- Position 5: O (✓)

Thus the word must be: _ I N G O

The only common 5-letter English word that fits is “INGOT”.

Let’s verify:
- I is in position 2 (✓)  
- N is in position 3 (✓)  
- G is in position 4 (but feedback said G is in the word but not in position 4).  
  – Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Re-examining Guess 3 (BINGO):
- B(x) – B is not in the word.  
- I(✓) – I is in the correct position (position 2).  
- N(✓) – N is in the correct position (position 3).  
- G(-) – G is in the word but not in position 4.  
- O(✓) – O is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word must be: _ I N _ O  
And G must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (but not 4, since it was marked “-” in position 4). Therefore G must be in position 1.

Hence the word is G I N G O.

“GINGO” is a valid 5-letter English word (a variant spelling of “jingling” or a game). However, it’s less common. The more common word is “INGOT”, but that would require G in position 4, which was ruled out.

Therefore the only possible word is “GINGO”.

But let me double-check: is there another word that fits _ I N _ O with G somewhere else?  
No, because G must be in position 1 (the only remaining spot), giving “GINGO”.

Thus, the next guess should be “GINGO”.

The only letter left is position 4.  
We know from earlier that G is already used in position 1, and we have ruled out A, R, S, E, P, T, B, and now position 4 cannot be G (because the second G in GINGO was marked “-”).  
Other letters already excluded: A, R, S, E, P, T, B.

Valid remaining letters for position 4 (from the alphabet minus all excluded letters): C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English 5-letter word that fits G I N _ O is “GINGO”, but we already tried that and got “-” for the second G.  
Next possible word: “GINKO” – a valid brand name / variant spelling, but not standard.  
Another: “GINDO” – not a word.  
“GINCO” – not standard.  
“GINHO” – not a word.  
“GINVO” – not a word.  
“GINFO” – not a word.  
“GINDO” – not a word.  
“GINKO” is the only remotely plausible non-standard variant.

However, the standard English word that fits is actually “INGOT”, but that would have G in position 4, which was ruled out.  
Wait – let me re-examine the exclusions carefully.

Letters we have ruled out so far: A, R, S, E, P, T, B.  
Letters we know must be present: G (position 1), I (position 2), N (position 3), O (position 5).  
Therefore position 4 must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out.  
The only common word left is “GINKO”, but it’s not in most dictionaries.

Rechecking: is there any other standard word?  
“GINKO” is actually recognized by some dictionaries as a variant of “gingko” (the tree).  
Given the constraints, “GINKO” is the only possible word left.

But let me think again – perhaps I missed a letter.  
Looking at the alphabet: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The only one that forms a valid word is “GINKO”.

Therefore, the next guess must be “GINKO”.

However, since we have only one guess left (this is Guess 5), and the word must be G I N _ O, and the only valid word fitting is “GINKO”, we must guess it.

But wait – let me confirm “GINKO” is acceptable. Yes, it’s listed in some dictionaries as a variant spelling of “gingko” (the tree). Given the constraints, this is the only possible word left.

Therefore, the final guess is:

<guess>GINKO</guess>
