For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses slightly different letters that might give better initial coverage.

So my first guess is AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s aim for a word with common remaining letters. “SLIMY” uses S, L, I, M, Y – none of which are ruled out, and S is in the 1st position (safe). Another candidate is “STUMP” (S, T, U, M, P) but U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet. “SLANT” has an A which is ruled out. “SLIMY” seems solid.

I’ll go with SLIMY.

Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 3: BUSTS  
Feedback: B(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- B is NOT in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so far it has appeared in positions 3 and 5, both marked “-”, meaning those positions are wrong for S).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- The final S (position 5) is marked “✓”, which is contradictory because earlier S’s were marked “-”.  
  However, the feedback format says each letter gets its own symbol, so the two S’s in BUSTS receive separate symbols.  
  Therefore:
  – Position 3 S: “-” → S is not in position 3.  
  – Position 5 S: “✓” → S is in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ U _ T S
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, B
- Letters confirmed in word: U (pos 2), T (pos 4), S (pos 5)
- Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven’t ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ U _ T S that uses only allowed letters in positions 1 and 3.

- G U N T S – “GUNTS” (valid but less common)
- J U N T S – “JUNTS” (rare)
- P U N T S – “PUNTS” (valid)

Among these, “DUNTS” and “HUNTS” are the most common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses slightly different letters that might give better initial coverage.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s aim for a word with common remaining letters. “SLIMY” uses S, L, I, M, Y – none of which are ruled out, and S is in the 1st position (safe). Another candidate is “STUMP” (S, T, U, M, P) but U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet. “SLANT” has an A which is ruled out. “SLIMY” seems solid.

I’ll go with SLIMY.

So far we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4 or 5.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L, I, M, Y are not in the word at all.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S (but not in positions 1, 4, or 5).

Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left).  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).  
- Contains only the allowed letters above.  
- Uses U as its vowel (since A, O, E, I are out).

A quick scan of common words fitting this pattern:  
- “BUSTS” – uses B, U, S, T, S. S appears twice and is in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
- “DUSTS” – similar to BUSTS.  
- “GUSTS” – G, U, S, T, S.  
- “HUSTS” – H, U, S, T, S.

All of these are valid. I’ll pick BUSTS because B is a common starting consonant and we haven’t tested it yet.

Therefore, the next guess is BUSTS.

- H is NOT in the word.
- U is correct in position 2.

- T is correct in position 4.
- S is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ U _ T S, and the letters we know are NOT in the word include: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, B, H, N.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: C, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? U ? T S using only these allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- C U T T S – invalid (double T)
- C U F T S – not a word
- C U P T S – not a word
- D U C T S – “DUCTS” (valid word, D U C T S)

- G U C T S – not a word
- J U C T S – not a word
- P U C T S – not a word
- V U C T S – not a word
- W U C T S – not a word

The only valid word fitting the pattern and using allowed letters is “DUCts” (but that’s not a word). Wait, let me double-check:

Actually, “DUCts” is not valid. Let me think again.

Valid 5-letter words ending in U_T_S:
- DUCTS – but DUCTS is D U C T S, which fits _ U _ T S. However, the third letter C is allowed, and D is allowed. So DUCTS is valid.

But let me confirm: D, U, C, T, S – none of these letters are ruled out. So DUCTS is a valid candidate.

Another possible word: “P U C T S” – not valid. “F U C T S” – not valid. “G U C T S” – not valid. “J U C T S” – not valid. “K U C T S” – not valid. “V U C T S” – not valid. “W U C T S” – not valid. “Z U C T S” – not valid.

Thus, the only valid word left is DUCTS.

- G U C T S – not a word
- J U C T S – not a word
- P U C T S – not a word
- V U C T S – not a word
- W U C T S – not a word

The only valid word fitting the pattern and using allowed letters is “DUCts” (but that’s not a word). Wait, let me double-check:

Actually, “DUCts” is not valid. Let me think again.

Valid 5-letter words ending in U_T_S:
- DUCTS – but DUCTS is D U C T S, which fits _ U _ T S. However, the third letter C is allowed, and D is allowed. So DUCTS is valid.

But let me confirm: D, U, C, T, S – none of these letters are ruled out. So DUCTS is a valid candidate.

Another possible word: “P U C T S” – not valid. “F U C T S” – not valid. “G U C T S” – not valid. “J U C T S” – not valid. “K U C T S” – not valid. “V U C T S” – not valid. “W U C T S” – not valid. “Z U C T S” – not valid.

Thus, the only valid word left is DUCTS.

Therefore, the next guess is DUCTS.",Guess 5: DUCTS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) C(x) T(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid word. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses slightly different letters that might give better initial coverage.

So my first guess is AROSE.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
1. The word contains an S, but not in the 5th position.
2. The word does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 1, 2, 3, or 4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, Q, J
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are out)

Let’s aim for a word with common remaining letters. “SLIMY” uses S, L, I, M, Y – none of which are ruled out, and S is in the 1st position (safe). Another candidate is “STUMP” (S, T, U, M, P) but U is a vowel we haven’t tested yet. “SLANT” has an A which is ruled out. “SLIMY” seems solid.

I’ll go with SLIMY.

Guess 2: SLIMY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4 or 5.

2. SLIMY → S(-) L(x) I(x) M(x) Y(x)  
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – L, I, M, Y are not in the word at all.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y.

Letters we know ARE in the word: S (but not in positions 1, 4, or 5).

Remaining vowels: U (only vowel left).  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S in position 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).  
- Contains only the allowed letters above.  
- Uses U as its vowel (since A, O, E, I are out).

A quick scan of common words fitting this pattern:  
- “BUSTS” – uses B, U, S, T, S. S appears twice and is in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
- “DUSTS” – similar to BUSTS.  
- “GUSTS” – G, U, S, T, S.  
- “HUSTS” – H, U, S, T, S.

All of these are valid. I’ll pick BUSTS because B is a common starting consonant and we haven’t tested it yet.

Therefore, the next guess is BUSTS.

Guess 3: BUSTS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the new feedback carefully.

Guess 3: BUSTS  
Feedback: B(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- B is NOT in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so far it has appeared in positions 3 and 5, both marked “-”, meaning those positions are wrong for S).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- The final S (position 5) is marked “✓”, which is contradictory because earlier S’s were marked “-”.  
  However, the feedback format says each letter gets its own symbol, so the two S’s in BUSTS receive separate symbols.  
  Therefore:
  – Position 3 S: “-” → S is not in position 3.  
  – Position 5 S: “✓” → S is in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: _ U _ T S
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, B
- Letters confirmed in word: U (pos 2), T (pos 4), S (pos 5)
- Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any we haven’t ruled out)

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ U _ T S that uses only allowed letters in positions 1 and 3.

Possible candidates:
- F U T T S – invalid (double T)
- C U N T S – “COUNTS” but O is ruled out.
- D U N T S – “DUNTS” (valid word, D U N T S)
- H U N T S – “HUNTS” (valid word, H U N T S)
- G U N T S – “GUNTS” (valid but less common)
- J U N T S – “JUNTS” (rare)
- P U N T S – “PUNTS” (valid)

Among these, “DUNTS” and “HUNTS” are the most common.  
“HUNTS” uses H, U, N, T, S – all allowed letters and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is HUNTS.

- H is NOT in the word.
- U is correct in position 2.

- T is correct in position 4.
- S is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ U _ T S, and the letters we know are NOT in the word include: A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, B, H, N.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: C, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? U ? T S using only these allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- C U T T S – invalid (double T)
- C U F T S – not a word
- C U P T S – not a word

Looking through a dictionary, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S and uses allowed letters is:

- J U S T S – but S is already in position 5, so this would have S in position 3 and 5, which might be allowed, but the word is ""J U S T S"".
- K U S T S – but this is not a valid word.
- P U S T S – but this is not a valid word.
- V U S T S – not a word.
- W U S T S – not a word.

However, ""JUSTS"" is not a valid English word. The valid word is ""JUICY"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible combinations.

Looking again, the only valid word that fits is ""JUSTS"" but it's not valid. It seems like we might have missed a possibility.

But actually, the word ""P U S T S"" is not valid. The word ""V U S T S"" is not valid. The word ""W U S T S"" is not valid.

Upon closer inspection, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S with the remaining letters is:

- F U S T S – but this is not a word.
- G U S T S – ""GUSTS"" is a valid word (G U S T S).

Let me check if G is allowed. Yes, G has not been eliminated.

""GUSTS"" uses G, U, S, T, S. The pattern is G U S T S, which matches _ U _ T S (position 3 is S, position 4 is T, position 5 is S).

Thus, the correct word must be ""GUSTS"".

The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S and uses allowed letters is GUSTS.

<guess>GUSTS</guess>",GUSTS,"From the feedback on DUCTS:

D(x) U(✓) C(x) T(✓) S(✓)

- D is NOT in the word.
- U is correct in position 2.
- C is NOT in the word.
- T is correct in position 4.
- S is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is still: _ U _ T S, and now we have eliminated D and C from consideration for position 3.

Letters we know are NOT in the word so far:
A, R, O, E, L, I, M, Y, B, H, N, D, C.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? U ? T S using only these letters.

Looking through a dictionary, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S and uses allowed letters is:

- J U S T S – but S is already in position 5, so this would have S in position 3 and 5, which might be allowed, but the word is ""J U S T S"".
- K U S T S – but this is not a valid word.
- P U S T S – but this is not a valid word.
- V U S T S – not a word.
- W U S T S – not a word.

However, ""JUSTS"" is not a valid English word. The valid word is ""JUICY"" but that doesn't fit the pattern.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters and possible combinations.

Looking again, the only valid word that fits is ""JUSTS"" but it's not valid. It seems like we might have missed a possibility.

But actually, the word ""P U S T S"" is not valid. The word ""V U S T S"" is not valid. The word ""W U S T S"" is not valid.

Upon closer inspection, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S with the remaining letters is:

- F U S T S – but this is not a word.
- G U S T S – ""GUSTS"" is a valid word (G U S T S).

Let me check if G is allowed. Yes, G has not been eliminated.

""GUSTS"" uses G, U, S, T, S. The pattern is G U S T S, which matches _ U _ T S (position 3 is S, position 4 is T, position 5 is S).

Thus, the correct word must be ""GUSTS"".The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ U _ T S and uses allowed letters is GUSTS.",Guess 6: GUSTS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) S(-) T(✓) S(✓),FAIL
