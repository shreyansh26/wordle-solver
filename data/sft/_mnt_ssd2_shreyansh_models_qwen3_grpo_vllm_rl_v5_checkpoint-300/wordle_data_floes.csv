For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, O, N, and L. 

Some popular strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, I, or R.
- S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, I, R.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and uses O or U as the other vowel. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 5 – but the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STOLE is invalid.

Next candidate: “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- S is in position 4 – but feedback says S is not in position 4. Invalid.

Next: “SPOKE”:
- S, P, O, K, E.
- S is in position 1 (valid), E in position 5 (invalid). 

Next: “SLOPE”:
- S, L, O, P, E.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “SNOUT”:
- S, N, O, U, T.
- No E, so invalid (we know E is in the word).

Next: “SLOES”:
- S, L, O, E, S.
- E in position 4 (valid), S in position 1 and 5 (position 5 S is valid since feedback only ruled out position 4 for S). But double S might be unlikely.

A better word: “SPORE” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SHOVE”:
- S, H, O, V, E.
- S in 1 (valid), E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SHONE”:
- S, H, O, N, E.
- E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SLOPE” already considered.

Next: “SLOBS” – no E.

Next: “SLEET”:
- S, L, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4 (valid), S in 1 (valid). This seems good, but double E might be less likely.

Next: “SHEET”:
- S, H, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4, S in 1. Valid.

But let’s try a word with S in position 2: “POSED” – no S.

“POSED” is invalid (no S).

“POSES”:
- P, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. S in 3 is valid (not position 4), E in 4 is valid (not position 5). This seems good.

But let’s check: “POSES” has S in positions 3 and 5. The feedback only ruled out S in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. So S in 3 or 5 is fine. E is in 4 (not 5) – fine.

Another option: “NOSES”:
- N, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. Same as above.

Between “POSES” and “NOSES”, “NOSES” is more common.

So I’ll go with “NOSES”.

Let’s digest the new feedback on NOSES:

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word ends in …E S.  
- O appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- R, A, I, N are completely absent.  
- S is only in positions 4 and 5 (but position 4 is already E).  
  Therefore the two S’s in NOSES were telling us:
  – S is in position 5.  
  – There is exactly one more S in the word, and it cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1 or 2).

We still need to place O and the remaining letters.  
Good consonants left to try: T, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U (A, I, E already handled).

Because we know the word ends in E S, we only need to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
We also know O is somewhere among 1, 2, 3 (but not 2, from the feedback).  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O _ _ E S  
Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  

But we also know there is exactly one more S in the word (besides position 5).  
That S must be in position 1 or 2.

Try pattern 1 with S in position 1: S O _ E S → impossible (double S).  
Try pattern 1 with S in position 2: O S _ E S → O S _ E S.

The blank must be a consonant we haven’t ruled out.  
Let’s pick T: O S T E S → “OSTES” – not a valid English word.  
Pick L: O S L E S – not valid.  
Pick D: O S D E S – not valid.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 3.  
Position 1: S O _ E S → S O _ E S.  
We need a consonant in position 3.  
Try S O T E S – “SOTES” – not valid.  
Try S O L E S – “SOLVES” – too long.  
Actually, “SOLVES” is 6 letters.  
“SOL ES” – no.  
“SOGES” – not valid.  
“SONES” – not valid.

Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 2.  
Position 1: S _ O E S → S _ O E S.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Position 2: _ S O E S.  
We need a consonant in position 1.  
Try T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
Try B S O E S – “BSOES” – not valid.  
Try C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.

Let’s step back and use the information that O must be in 1 or 3 and S must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
We also know the word must be 5 letters ending in E S.

Let’s list possible words ending in E S with O somewhere and no R, A, I, N:

- “HOUSE” – H, O, U, S, E. Ends in E S? No, ends in E.  
- “POISE” – P, O, I, S, E. I is excluded.  
- “COVES” – C, O, V, E, S. I is excluded, V is allowed.  
  Check: C, O, V, E, S.  
  – Contains O (not in 2) – yes, O is in 2? No, O is in 2 in COVES, but feedback says O is not in 2. So COVES is invalid.  
- “DOVES” – D, O, V, E, S. O is in 2 – invalid.  
- “LOVES” – L, O, V, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “MOSES” – M, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “TOLES” – T, O, L, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “BOSES” – B, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.

Hmm, all these have O in 2.  
We need O not in 2.  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try O in 1: O _ _ E S  
We need one S in 2 or 3.  
But S cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2.  
Thus: O S _ E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet used.  
Try O S T E S – “OSTES” – not valid.  
Try O S L E S – “OSLES” – not valid.  
Try O S K E S – “OSKES” – not valid.  
Try O S B E S – “OSBES” – not valid.

Try O in 3: _ _ O E S  
We need S in 1 or 2.  
S _ O E S – S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
_ S O E S – T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.  
P S O E S – “PSOES” – not valid.

Wait, let’s think of actual English words ending in E S with O not in 2:

- “OCEAN” – ends in AN.  
- “OCHER” – ends in ER.  
- “OPENS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, P, E, N, S.  
  – O is in 1 – valid.  
  – P, E, N, S – E is in 4, S in 5 – matches.  
  – No R, A, I, N – N is excluded. So “OPENS” is invalid because N is excluded.  
- “OFTEN” – ends in N.  
- “OLIVE” – ends in E.  
- “ONSET” – ends in T.  
- “OUSTS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, S, T, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – S in 3 and 5 – S is allowed in 3 (feedback only ruled out 4), and 5.  
  – E is supposed to be in 4, but “OUSTS” has no E. So invalid.  
- “OUTER” – ends in R.  
- “OUTES” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, T, E, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – E in 4 – matches.  
  – S in 5 – matches.  
  – U is allowed.  
  – No R, A, I, N – good.  
  “OUTES” is a valid English word (variant spelling of “outwears” in some contexts, but more importantly, it’s accepted in Scrabble lists).

Another candidate: “OUTES”.

Let’s verify:

O U T E S  
- O in 1 – allowed (not in 2).  
- U – allowed.  
- T – allowed.  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- S in 5 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- S is also in 5, and we know S is in 5 – that’s fine.  
- The extra S from NOSES feedback is satisfied (S appears twice: once in 5 and once in 3, but wait – in NOSES, S was in 3 and 5, and feedback said S is in 5 and not in 3 – so the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S, not in 3. So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  

Oops! I missed that.  
From NOSES feedback:  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
So the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  
Therefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  
Thus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.

So patterns are:
1. S _ _ E S  
2. _ S _ E S  

Let’s try pattern 1: S _ _ E S  
We need O somewhere in 2 or 3.  
O cannot be in 2 (from NOSES feedback O(-)), so O must be in 3.  
Thus: S _ O E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet excluded.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Try S C O E S – “SCOES” – not valid.  
Try S L O E S – “SLOES” – valid (variant of “sloshes”).  
Check: S, L, O, E, S.  
– S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S requirement.  
– O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
– E in 4 – matches.  
– No R, A, I, N – good.  

Pattern 2: _ S _ E S  
O must be in 1 or 3.  
If O is in 1: O S _ E S – but then we need another S in 3, but S cannot be in 3 (from NOSES feedback).  
If O is in 3: _ S O E S – then first letter must be S (to have second S).  
Thus: _ S O E S becomes S S O E S – “SSOES” – not valid.  

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOES”.

Let’s confirm “SLOES”:
S L O E S  
- S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S (one in 5, one not in 3).  
- O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- Valid 5-letter word (variant of “sloshes”).

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word ends in …E S.  
- O appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- R, A, I, N are completely absent.  
- S is only in positions 4 and 5 (but position 4 is already E).  
  Therefore the two S’s in NOSES were telling us:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, O, N, and L. 

Some popular strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, I, or R.
- S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, I, R.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and uses O or U as the other vowel. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 5 – but the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STOLE is invalid.

Next candidate: “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- S is in position 4 – but feedback says S is not in position 4. Invalid.

Next: “SPOKE”:
- S, P, O, K, E.
- S is in position 1 (valid), E in position 5 (invalid). 

Next: “SLOPE”:
- S, L, O, P, E.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “SNOUT”:
- S, N, O, U, T.
- No E, so invalid (we know E is in the word).

Next: “SLOES”:
- S, L, O, E, S.
- E in position 4 (valid), S in position 1 and 5 (position 5 S is valid since feedback only ruled out position 4 for S). But double S might be unlikely.

A better word: “SPORE” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SHOVE”:
- S, H, O, V, E.
- S in 1 (valid), E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SHONE”:
- S, H, O, N, E.
- E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SLOPE” already considered.

Next: “SLOBS” – no E.

Next: “SLEET”:
- S, L, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4 (valid), S in 1 (valid). This seems good, but double E might be less likely.

Next: “SHEET”:
- S, H, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4, S in 1. Valid.

But let’s try a word with S in position 2: “POSED” – no S.

“POSED” is invalid (no S).

“POSES”:
- P, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. S in 3 is valid (not position 4), E in 4 is valid (not position 5). This seems good.

But let’s check: “POSES” has S in positions 3 and 5. The feedback only ruled out S in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. So S in 3 or 5 is fine. E is in 4 (not 5) – fine.

Another option: “NOSES”:
- N, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. Same as above.

Between “POSES” and “NOSES”, “NOSES” is more common.

So I’ll go with “NOSES”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on NOSES:

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word ends in …E S.  
- O appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- R, A, I, N are completely absent.  
- S is only in positions 4 and 5 (but position 4 is already E).  
  Therefore the two S’s in NOSES were telling us:
  – S is in position 5.  
  – There is exactly one more S in the word, and it cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1 or 2).

We still need to place O and the remaining letters.  
Good consonants left to try: T, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U (A, I, E already handled).

Because we know the word ends in E S, we only need to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
We also know O is somewhere among 1, 2, 3 (but not 2, from the feedback).  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O _ _ E S  
Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  

But we also know there is exactly one more S in the word (besides position 5).  
That S must be in position 1 or 2.

Try pattern 1 with S in position 1: S O _ E S → impossible (double S).  
Try pattern 1 with S in position 2: O S _ E S → O S _ E S.

The blank must be a consonant we haven’t ruled out.  
Let’s pick T: O S T E S → “OSTES” – not a valid English word.  
Pick L: O S L E S – not valid.  
Pick D: O S D E S – not valid.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 3.  
Position 1: S O _ E S → S O _ E S.  
We need a consonant in position 3.  
Try S O T E S – “SOTES” – not valid.  
Try S O L E S – “SOLVES” – too long.  
Actually, “SOLVES” is 6 letters.  
“SOL ES” – no.  
“SOGES” – not valid.  
“SONES” – not valid.

Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 2.  
Position 1: S _ O E S → S _ O E S.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Position 2: _ S O E S.  
We need a consonant in position 1.  
Try T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
Try B S O E S – “BSOES” – not valid.  
Try C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.

Let’s step back and use the information that O must be in 1 or 3 and S must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
We also know the word must be 5 letters ending in E S.

Let’s list possible words ending in E S with O somewhere and no R, A, I, N:

- “HOUSE” – H, O, U, S, E. Ends in E S? No, ends in E.  
- “POISE” – P, O, I, S, E. I is excluded.  
- “COVES” – C, O, V, E, S. I is excluded, V is allowed.  
  Check: C, O, V, E, S.  
  – Contains O (not in 2) – yes, O is in 2? No, O is in 2 in COVES, but feedback says O is not in 2. So COVES is invalid.  
- “DOVES” – D, O, V, E, S. O is in 2 – invalid.  
- “LOVES” – L, O, V, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “MOSES” – M, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “TOLES” – T, O, L, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “BOSES” – B, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.

Hmm, all these have O in 2.  
We need O not in 2.  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try O in 1: O _ _ E S  
We need one S in 2 or 3.  
But S cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2.  
Thus: O S _ E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet used.  
Try O S T E S – “OSTES” – not valid.  
Try O S L E S – “OSLES” – not valid.  
Try O S K E S – “OSKES” – not valid.  
Try O S B E S – “OSBES” – not valid.

Try O in 3: _ _ O E S  
We need S in 1 or 2.  
S _ O E S – S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
_ S O E S – T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.  
P S O E S – “PSOES” – not valid.

Wait, let’s think of actual English words ending in E S with O not in 2:

- “OCEAN” – ends in AN.  
- “OCHER” – ends in ER.  
- “OPENS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, P, E, N, S.  
  – O is in 1 – valid.  
  – P, E, N, S – E is in 4, S in 5 – matches.  
  – No R, A, I, N – N is excluded. So “OPENS” is invalid because N is excluded.  
- “OFTEN” – ends in N.  
- “OLIVE” – ends in E.  
- “ONSET” – ends in T.  
- “OUSTS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, S, T, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – S in 3 and 5 – S is allowed in 3 (feedback only ruled out 4), and 5.  
  – E is supposed to be in 4, but “OUSTS” has no E. So invalid.  
- “OUTER” – ends in R.  
- “OUTES” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, T, E, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – E in 4 – matches.  
  – S in 5 – matches.  
  – U is allowed.  
  – No R, A, I, N – good.  
  “OUTES” is a valid English word (variant spelling of “outwears” in some contexts, but more importantly, it’s accepted in Scrabble lists).

Another candidate: “OUTES”.

Let’s verify:

O U T E S  
- O in 1 – allowed (not in 2).  
- U – allowed.  
- T – allowed.  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- S in 5 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- S is also in 5, and we know S is in 5 – that’s fine.  
- The extra S from NOSES feedback is satisfied (S appears twice: once in 5 and once in 3, but wait – in NOSES, S was in 3 and 5, and feedback said S is in 5 and not in 3 – so the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S, not in 3. So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  

Oops! I missed that.  
From NOSES feedback:  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
So the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  
Therefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  
Thus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.

So patterns are:
1. S _ _ E S  
2. _ S _ E S  

Let’s try pattern 1: S _ _ E S  
We need O somewhere in 2 or 3.  
O cannot be in 2 (from NOSES feedback O(-)), so O must be in 3.  
Thus: S _ O E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet excluded.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Try S C O E S – “SCOES” – not valid.  
Try S L O E S – “SLOES” – valid (variant of “sloshes”).  
Check: S, L, O, E, S.  
– S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S requirement.  
– O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
– E in 4 – matches.  
– No R, A, I, N – good.  

Pattern 2: _ S _ E S  
O must be in 1 or 3.  
If O is in 1: O S _ E S – but then we need another S in 3, but S cannot be in 3 (from NOSES feedback).  
If O is in 3: _ S O E S – then first letter must be S (to have second S).  
Thus: _ S O E S becomes S S O E S – “SSOES” – not valid.  

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOES”.

Let’s confirm “SLOES”:
S L O E S  
- S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S (one in 5, one not in 3).  
- O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- Valid 5-letter word (variant of “sloshes”).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, O, N, and L. 

Some popular strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, I, or R.
- S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, I, R.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and uses O or U as the other vowel. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 5 – but the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STOLE is invalid.

Next candidate: “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- S is in position 4 – but feedback says S is not in position 4. Invalid.

Next: “SPOKE”:
- S, P, O, K, E.
- S is in position 1 (valid), E in position 5 (invalid). 

Next: “SLOPE”:
- S, L, O, P, E.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “SNOUT”:
- S, N, O, U, T.
- No E, so invalid (we know E is in the word).

Next: “SLOES”:
- S, L, O, E, S.
- E in position 4 (valid), S in position 1 and 5 (position 5 S is valid since feedback only ruled out position 4 for S). But double S might be unlikely.

A better word: “SPORE” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SHOVE”:
- S, H, O, V, E.
- S in 1 (valid), E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SHONE”:
- S, H, O, N, E.
- E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SLOPE” already considered.

Next: “SLOBS” – no E.

Next: “SLEET”:
- S, L, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4 (valid), S in 1 (valid). This seems good, but double E might be less likely.

Next: “SHEET”:
- S, H, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4, S in 1. Valid.

But let’s try a word with S in position 2: “POSED” – no S.

“POSED” is invalid (no S).

“POSES”:
- P, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. S in 3 is valid (not position 4), E in 4 is valid (not position 5). This seems good.

But let’s check: “POSES” has S in positions 3 and 5. The feedback only ruled out S in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. So S in 3 or 5 is fine. E is in 4 (not 5) – fine.

Another option: “NOSES”:
- N, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. Same as above.

Between “POSES” and “NOSES”, “NOSES” is more common.

So I’ll go with “NOSES”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on NOSES:

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word ends in …E S.  
- O appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- R, A, I, N are completely absent.  
- S is only in positions 4 and 5 (but position 4 is already E).  
  Therefore the two S’s in NOSES were telling us:
  – S is in position 5.  
  – There is exactly one more S in the word, and it cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1 or 2).

We still need to place O and the remaining letters.  
Good consonants left to try: T, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U (A, I, E already handled).

Because we know the word ends in E S, we only need to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
We also know O is somewhere among 1, 2, 3 (but not 2, from the feedback).  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O _ _ E S  
Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  

But we also know there is exactly one more S in the word (besides position 5).  
That S must be in position 1 or 2.

Try pattern 1 with S in position 1: S O _ E S → impossible (double S).  
Try pattern 1 with S in position 2: O S _ E S → O S _ E S.

The blank must be a consonant we haven’t ruled out.  
Let’s pick T: O S T E S → “OSTES” – not a valid English word.  
Pick L: O S L E S – not valid.  
Pick D: O S D E S – not valid.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 3.  
Position 1: S O _ E S → S O _ E S.  
We need a consonant in position 3.  
Try S O T E S – “SOTES” – not valid.  
Try S O L E S – “SOLVES” – too long.  
Actually, “SOLVES” is 6 letters.  
“SOL ES” – no.  
“SOGES” – not valid.  
“SONES” – not valid.

Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 2.  
Position 1: S _ O E S → S _ O E S.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Position 2: _ S O E S.  
We need a consonant in position 1.  
Try T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
Try B S O E S – “BSOES” – not valid.  
Try C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.

Let’s step back and use the information that O must be in 1 or 3 and S must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
We also know the word must be 5 letters ending in E S.

Let’s list possible words ending in E S with O somewhere and no R, A, I, N:

- “HOUSE” – H, O, U, S, E. Ends in E S? No, ends in E.  
- “POISE” – P, O, I, S, E. I is excluded.  
- “COVES” – C, O, V, E, S. I is excluded, V is allowed.  
  Check: C, O, V, E, S.  
  – Contains O (not in 2) – yes, O is in 2? No, O is in 2 in COVES, but feedback says O is not in 2. So COVES is invalid.  
- “DOVES” – D, O, V, E, S. O is in 2 – invalid.  
- “LOVES” – L, O, V, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “MOSES” – M, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “TOLES” – T, O, L, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “BOSES” – B, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.

Hmm, all these have O in 2.  
We need O not in 2.  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try O in 1: O _ _ E S  
We need one S in 2 or 3.  
But S cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2.  
Thus: O S _ E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet used.  
Try O S T E S – “OSTES” – not valid.  
Try O S L E S – “OSLES” – not valid.  
Try O S K E S – “OSKES” – not valid.  
Try O S B E S – “OSBES” – not valid.

Try O in 3: _ _ O E S  
We need S in 1 or 2.  
S _ O E S – S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
_ S O E S – T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.  
P S O E S – “PSOES” – not valid.

Wait, let’s think of actual English words ending in E S with O not in 2:

- “OCEAN” – ends in AN.  
- “OCHER” – ends in ER.  
- “OPENS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, P, E, N, S.  
  – O is in 1 – valid.  
  – P, E, N, S – E is in 4, S in 5 – matches.  
  – No R, A, I, N – N is excluded. So “OPENS” is invalid because N is excluded.  
- “OFTEN” – ends in N.  
- “OLIVE” – ends in E.  
- “ONSET” – ends in T.  
- “OUSTS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, S, T, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – S in 3 and 5 – S is allowed in 3 (feedback only ruled out 4), and 5.  
  – E is supposed to be in 4, but “OUSTS” has no E. So invalid.  
- “OUTER” – ends in R.  
- “OUTES” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, T, E, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – E in 4 – matches.  
  – S in 5 – matches.  
  – U is allowed.  
  – No R, A, I, N – good.  
  “OUTES” is a valid English word (variant spelling of “outwears” in some contexts, but more importantly, it’s accepted in Scrabble lists).

Another candidate: “OUTES”.

Let’s verify:

O U T E S  
- O in 1 – allowed (not in 2).  
- U – allowed.  
- T – allowed.  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- S in 5 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- S is also in 5, and we know S is in 5 – that’s fine.  
- The extra S from NOSES feedback is satisfied (S appears twice: once in 5 and once in 3, but wait – in NOSES, S was in 3 and 5, and feedback said S is in 5 and not in 3 – so the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S, not in 3. So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  

Oops! I missed that.  
From NOSES feedback:  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
So the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  
Therefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  
Thus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.

So patterns are:
1. S _ _ E S  
2. _ S _ E S  

Let’s try pattern 1: S _ _ E S  
We need O somewhere in 2 or 3.  
O cannot be in 2 (from NOSES feedback O(-)), so O must be in 3.  
Thus: S _ O E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet excluded.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Try S C O E S – “SCOES” – not valid.  
Try S L O E S – “SLOES” – valid (variant of “sloshes”).  
Check: S, L, O, E, S.  
– S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S requirement.  
– O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
– E in 4 – matches.  
– No R, A, I, N – good.  

Pattern 2: _ S _ E S  
O must be in 1 or 3.  
If O is in 1: O S _ E S – but then we need another S in 3, but S cannot be in 3 (from NOSES feedback).  
If O is in 3: _ S O E S – then first letter must be S (to have second S).  
Thus: _ S O E S becomes S S O E S – “SSOES” – not valid.  

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOES”.

Let’s confirm “SLOES”:
S L O E S  
- S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S (one in 5, one not in 3).  
- O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- Valid 5-letter word (variant of “sloshes”).

Guess 3: SLOES -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) O(✓) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s decode the new feedback on SLOES:

S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
L(✓) – L is in position 2.  
O(✓) – O is in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So the word is now fully determined except for the first letter:

_ L O E S

We know:
- Letters already placed: L, O, E, S.  
- Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, N, S (for position 1).  
- The first letter must be a consonant not yet used and must not be S (since S is only in position 5).  
- Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in LOES:

The most common word is “CLOSE” – but C is allowed and fits.

Check constraints:
C, L, O, S, E  
- C not yet excluded.  
- L, O, E, S positions match.  
- No R, A, I, N.  
- S only in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word must be “CLOSE”.

So “OPENS” is invalid because N is excluded.  \n- “OFTEN” – ends in N.  \n- “OLIVE” – ends in E.  \n- “ONSET” – ends in T.  \n- “OUSTS” – ends in S.  \n  Check O, U, S, T, S.  \n  – O in 1 – valid.  \n  – S in 3 and 5 – S is allowed in 3 (feedback only ruled out 4), and 5.  \n  – E is supposed to be in 4, but “OUSTS” has no E. So invalid.  \n- “OUTER” – ends in R.  \n- “OUTES” – ends in S.  \n  Check O, U, T, E, S.  \n  – O in 1 – valid.  \n  – E in 4 – matches.  \n  – S in 5 – matches.  \n  – U is allowed.  \n  – No R, A, I, N – good.  \n  “OUTES” is a valid English word (variant spelling of “outwears” in some contexts, but more importantly, it’s accepted in Scrabble lists).\n\nAnother candidate: “OUTES”.\n\nLet’s verify:\n\nO U T E S  \n- O in 1 – allowed (not in 2).  \n- U – allowed.  \n- T – allowed.  \n- E in 4 – matches.  \n- S in 5 – matches.  \n- No R, A, I, N – good.  \n- S is also in 5, and we know S is in 5 – that’s fine.  \n- The extra S from NOSES feedback is satisfied (S appears twice: once in 5 and once in 3, but wait – in NOSES, S was in 3 and 5, and feedback said S is in 5 and not in 3 – so the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S, not in 3. So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  \n\nOops! I missed that.  \nFrom NOSES feedback:  \n- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  \n- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  \nSo the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  \nTherefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  \nThus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.\n\nSo patterns are:\n1.

Let’s update what we know after the four guesses.

Known positions (✓):
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S   (from Guess 2 and 3, but now Guess 4 shows S is NOT in position 5)

Wait! Guess 4 feedback for S is (-) instead of (✓).  
That means:  
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

But earlier feedback (Guess 2: S(✓) and Guess 3: S(✓)) said S is in position 5.  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback for Guess 4 was misread.

Rechecking Guess 4: CLOSE -> C(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(-)

Ah! The last two symbols are (-) for both S and E, meaning:
- L is correct in position 2.  
- O is correct in position 3.  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

This overrules the earlier (✓) marks for S in positions 4 and 5.  
So we must reinterpret:

From Guess 2 (NOSES):  
- E(✓) means E is in position 4.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  

From Guess 3 (SLOES):  
- E(✓) again confirms E in position 4.  
- S(✓) again confirms S in position 5.  

From Guess 4 (CLOSE):  
- L(✓) confirms L in position 2.  
- O(✓) confirms O in position 3.  
- S(-) and E(-) now say S is NOT in position 5 and E is NOT in position 4.  

This is impossible unless there was a typo.  
Assuming the latest feedback is authoritative, we must accept:
- E is NOT in position 4.  
- S is NOT in position 5.

Therefore, the word pattern is:
_ L O _ _

with letters still to place: S and E, and one more consonant.

Possible positions:
- S must be in 1 or 4 (not 5, and 2,3 taken).  
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2,3 taken), so 1 or 5.  

We also know:
- Letters used so far: L, O, S, E.  
- Ruled out: R, A, I, N, C.  

Remaining consonants for position 1 or 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible words:

  - L in 2 – matches.  
  - O in 3 – matches.  
  - P in 4 – not ruled out.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, I, O, N, and L. 

Some popular strategic starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly strong because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal multiple letters in the secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

<guess>RAISE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- I(x) – I is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not A, I, or R.
- S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, I, R.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, etc.
Vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out).

Let’s try a word that places S in a different spot and uses O or U as the other vowel. A good candidate is “STOLE”:
- S is in position 1 (not 4) – satisfies the feedback.
- E is in position 5 – but the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STOLE is invalid.

Next candidate: “HOUSE”:
- H, O, U, S, E.
- S is in position 4 – but feedback says S is not in position 4. Invalid.

Next: “SPOKE”:
- S, P, O, K, E.
- S is in position 1 (valid), E in position 5 (invalid). 

Next: “SLOPE”:
- S, L, O, P, E.
- E in position 5 (invalid).

Next: “SNOUT”:
- S, N, O, U, T.
- No E, so invalid (we know E is in the word).

Next: “SLOES”:
- S, L, O, E, S.
- E in position 4 (valid), S in position 1 and 5 (position 5 S is valid since feedback only ruled out position 4 for S). But double S might be unlikely.

A better word: “SPORE” – but R is excluded.

Next: “SHOVE”:
- S, H, O, V, E.
- S in 1 (valid), E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SHONE”:
- S, H, O, N, E.
- E in 5 (invalid).

Next: “SLOPE” already considered.

Next: “SLOBS” – no E.

Next: “SLEET”:
- S, L, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4 (valid), S in 1 (valid). This seems good, but double E might be less likely.

Next: “SHEET”:
- S, H, E, E, T.
- E in 3 and 4, S in 1. Valid.

But let’s try a word with S in position 2: “POSED” – no S.

“POSED” is invalid (no S).

“POSES”:
- P, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. S in 3 is valid (not position 4), E in 4 is valid (not position 5). This seems good.

But let’s check: “POSES” has S in positions 3 and 5. The feedback only ruled out S in position 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are possible. So S in 3 or 5 is fine. E is in 4 (not 5) – fine.

Another option: “NOSES”:
- N, O, S, E, S.
- S in 3 and 5, E in 4. Same as above.

Between “POSES” and “NOSES”, “NOSES” is more common.

So I’ll go with “NOSES”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on NOSES:

N(x) – N is not in the word.  
O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word ends in …E S.  
- O appears somewhere, but not in position 2.  
- R, A, I, N are completely absent.  
- S is only in positions 4 and 5 (but position 4 is already E).  
  Therefore the two S’s in NOSES were telling us:
  – S is in position 5.  
  – There is exactly one more S in the word, and it cannot be in position 3 (so it must be in 1 or 2).

We still need to place O and the remaining letters.  
Good consonants left to try: T, L, C, D, B, G, M, P, H, K, etc.  
Vowels left: O, U (A, I, E already handled).

Because we know the word ends in E S, we only need to fill positions 1, 2, 3.  
We also know O is somewhere among 1, 2, 3 (but not 2, from the feedback).  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O _ _ E S  
Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  

But we also know there is exactly one more S in the word (besides position 5).  
That S must be in position 1 or 2.

Try pattern 1 with S in position 1: S O _ E S → impossible (double S).  
Try pattern 1 with S in position 2: O S _ E S → O S _ E S.

The blank must be a consonant we haven’t ruled out.  
Let’s pick T: O S T E S → “OSTES” – not a valid English word.  
Pick L: O S L E S – not valid.  
Pick D: O S D E S – not valid.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 3.  
Position 1: S O _ E S → S O _ E S.  
We need a consonant in position 3.  
Try S O T E S – “SOTES” – not valid.  
Try S O L E S – “SOLVES” – too long.  
Actually, “SOLVES” is 6 letters.  
“SOL ES” – no.  
“SOGES” – not valid.  
“SONES” – not valid.

Pattern 3: _ _ O E S  
The S must be in position 1 or 2.  
Position 1: S _ O E S → S _ O E S.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Position 2: _ S O E S.  
We need a consonant in position 1.  
Try T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
Try B S O E S – “BSOES” – not valid.  
Try C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.

Let’s step back and use the information that O must be in 1 or 3 and S must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
We also know the word must be 5 letters ending in E S.

Let’s list possible words ending in E S with O somewhere and no R, A, I, N:

- “HOUSE” – H, O, U, S, E. Ends in E S? No, ends in E.  
- “POISE” – P, O, I, S, E. I is excluded.  
- “COVES” – C, O, V, E, S. I is excluded, V is allowed.  
  Check: C, O, V, E, S.  
  – Contains O (not in 2) – yes, O is in 2? No, O is in 2 in COVES, but feedback says O is not in 2. So COVES is invalid.  
- “DOVES” – D, O, V, E, S. O is in 2 – invalid.  
- “LOVES” – L, O, V, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “MOSES” – M, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “TOLES” – T, O, L, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.  
- “BOSES” – B, O, S, E, S. O in 2 – invalid.

Hmm, all these have O in 2.  
We need O not in 2.  
So O must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try O in 1: O _ _ E S  
We need one S in 2 or 3.  
But S cannot be in 3 (from feedback), so S must be in 2.  
Thus: O S _ E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet used.  
Try O S T E S – “OSTES” – not valid.  
Try O S L E S – “OSLES” – not valid.  
Try O S K E S – “OSKES” – not valid.  
Try O S B E S – “OSBES” – not valid.

Try O in 3: _ _ O E S  
We need S in 1 or 2.  
S _ O E S – S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
_ S O E S – T S O E S – “TSOES” – not valid.  
C S O E S – “CSOES” – not valid.  
P S O E S – “PSOES” – not valid.

Wait, let’s think of actual English words ending in E S with O not in 2:

- “OCEAN” – ends in AN.  
- “OCHER” – ends in ER.  
- “OPENS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, P, E, N, S.  
  – O is in 1 – valid.  
  – P, E, N, S – E is in 4, S in 5 – matches.  
  – No R, A, I, N – N is excluded. So “OPENS” is invalid because N is excluded.  
- “OFTEN” – ends in N.  
- “OLIVE” – ends in E.  
- “ONSET” – ends in T.  
- “OUSTS” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, S, T, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – S in 3 and 5 – S is allowed in 3 (feedback only ruled out 4), and 5.  
  – E is supposed to be in 4, but “OUSTS” has no E. So invalid.  
- “OUTER” – ends in R.  
- “OUTES” – ends in S.  
  Check O, U, T, E, S.  
  – O in 1 – valid.  
  – E in 4 – matches.  
  – S in 5 – matches.  
  – U is allowed.  
  – No R, A, I, N – good.  
  “OUTES” is a valid English word (variant spelling of “outwears” in some contexts, but more importantly, it’s accepted in Scrabble lists).

Another candidate: “OUTES”.

Let’s verify:

O U T E S  
- O in 1 – allowed (not in 2).  
- U – allowed.  
- T – allowed.  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- S in 5 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- S is also in 5, and we know S is in 5 – that’s fine.  
- The extra S from NOSES feedback is satisfied (S appears twice: once in 5 and once in 3, but wait – in NOSES, S was in 3 and 5, and feedback said S is in 5 and not in 3 – so the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S, not in 3. So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  

Oops! I missed that.  
From NOSES feedback:  
- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
So the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  
Therefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  
Thus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.

So patterns are:
1. S _ _ E S  
2. _ S _ E S  

Let’s try pattern 1: S _ _ E S  
We need O somewhere in 2 or 3.  
O cannot be in 2 (from NOSES feedback O(-)), so O must be in 3.  
Thus: S _ O E S.  
The blank must be a consonant not yet excluded.  
Try S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  
Try S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  
Try S C O E S – “SCOES” – not valid.  
Try S L O E S – “SLOES” – valid (variant of “sloshes”).  
Check: S, L, O, E, S.  
– S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S requirement.  
– O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
– E in 4 – matches.  
– No R, A, I, N – good.  

Pattern 2: _ S _ E S  
O must be in 1 or 3.  
If O is in 1: O S _ E S – but then we need another S in 3, but S cannot be in 3 (from NOSES feedback).  
If O is in 3: _ S O E S – then first letter must be S (to have second S).  
Thus: _ S O E S becomes S S O E S – “SSOES” – not valid.  

Therefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOES”.

Let’s confirm “SLOES”:
S L O E S  
- S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S (one in 5, one not in 3).  
- O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  
- E in 4 – matches.  
- No R, A, I, N – good.  
- Valid 5-letter word (variant of “sloshes”).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 3: SLOES -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) O(✓) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s decode the new feedback on SLOES:

S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1.  
L(✓) – L is in position 2.  
O(✓) – O is in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in position 4.  
S(✓) – S is in position 5.

So the word is now fully determined except for the first letter:

_ L O E S

We know:
- Letters already placed: L, O, E, S.  
- Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, N, S (for position 1).  
- The first letter must be a consonant not yet used and must not be S (since S is only in position 5).  
- Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in LOES:

The most common word is “CLOSE” – but C is allowed and fits.

Check constraints:
C, L, O, S, E  
- C not yet excluded.  
- L, O, E, S positions match.  
- No R, A, I, N.  
- S only in position 5, which is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word must be “CLOSE”.

Let’s update what we know after the four guesses.

Known positions (✓):
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S   (from Guess 2 and 3, but now Guess 4 shows S is NOT in position 5)

Wait! Guess 4 feedback for S is (-) instead of (✓).  
That means:  
- S is in the word, but NOT in position 5.

But earlier feedback (Guess 2: S(✓) and Guess 3: S(✓)) said S is in position 5.  
This is a contradiction unless the feedback for Guess 4 was misread.

Rechecking Guess 4: CLOSE -> C(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(-)

Ah! The last two symbols are (-) for both S and E, meaning:
- L is correct in position 2.  
- O is correct in position 3.  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

This overrules the earlier (✓) marks for S in positions 4 and 5.  
So we must reinterpret:

From Guess 2 (NOSES):  
- E(✓) means E is in position 4.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  

From Guess 3 (SLOES):  
- E(✓) again confirms E in position 4.  
- S(✓) again confirms S in position 5.  

From Guess 4 (CLOSE):  
- L(✓) confirms L in position 2.  
- O(✓) confirms O in position 3.  
- S(-) and E(-) now say S is NOT in position 5 and E is NOT in position 4.  

This is impossible unless there was a typo.  
Assuming the latest feedback is authoritative, we must accept:
- E is NOT in position 4.  
- S is NOT in position 5.

Therefore, the word pattern is:
_ L O _ _

with letters still to place: S and E, and one more consonant.

Possible positions:
- S must be in 1 or 4 (not 5, and 2,3 taken).  
- E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 2,3 taken), so 1 or 5.  

We also know:
- Letters used so far: L, O, S, E.  
- Ruled out: R, A, I, N, C.  

Remaining consonants for position 1 or 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y.

Let’s list possible words:

Pattern _ L O _ _ with S and E to place.

Option 1: S in 4, E in 1 or 5  
- E L O S _ → ELOSE – invalid.  
- _ L O S E → must have S in 4, E in 5: _ L O S E.  
  First letter: must be consonant not used yet.  
  Try B: BLOSE – not a word.  
  Try D: DLOSE – not a word.  
  Try F: FLOSE – not a word.  
  Try G: GLOSE – not a word.  
  Try H: HLOSE – not a word.  
  Try K: KLOSE – not a word.  
  Try M: MLOSE – not a word.  
  Try P: PLOSE – not a word.  
  Try T: TLOSE – not a word.  
  Try V: VLOSE – not a word.  
  Try W: WLOSE – not a word.  
  Try Y: YLOSE – not a word.  

Option 2: E in 1, S in 4  
- E L O S _ – same issue, no valid 5-letter word.  

Option 3: S in 1, E in 5  
- S L O _ E  
  Fourth letter: must be consonant not used yet.  
  Try B: SLOBE – not a word.  
  Try D: SLODE – not a word.  
  Try F: SLOFE – not a word.  
  Try G: SLOGE – not a word.  
  Try H: SLOHE – not a word.  
  Try K: SLOKE – not a word.  
  Try M: SLOME – not a word.  
  Try P: SLOPE – valid word!  
  Check constraints:  
  - S in 1 – allowed (not ruled out).  
  - L in 2 – matches.  
  - O in 3 – matches.  
  - P in 4 – not ruled out.  
  - E in 5 – allowed (only ruled out for position 4).  

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOPE”.

So the other S must be in 1 or 2. In “OUTES” there is only one S in 5 – so this doesn’t satisfy the double-S requirement.  \n\nOops! I missed that.  \nFrom NOSES feedback:  \n- S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 3.  \n- S(✓) means S is in position 5.  \nSo the word must have S in 5 and exactly one more S elsewhere (since NOSES had two S’s and only one was marked ✓).  \nTherefore the word must contain two S’s: one in 5 and one elsewhere (not 3).  \nThus the word must have two S’s: one in 5 and one in 1 or 2.\n\nSo patterns are:\n1. S _ _ E S  \n2. _ S _ E S  \n\nLet’s try pattern 1: S _ _ E S  \nWe need O somewhere in 2 or 3.  \nO cannot be in 2 (from NOSES feedback O(-)), so O must be in 3.  \nThus: S _ O E S.  \nThe blank must be a consonant not yet excluded.  \nTry S T O E S – “STOES” – not valid.  \nTry S P O E S – “POES” – too short.  \nTry S C O E S – “SCOES” – not valid.  \nTry S L O E S – “SLOES” – valid (variant of “sloshes”).  \nCheck: S, L, O, E, S.  \n– S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S requirement.  \n– O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  \n– E in 4 – matches.  \n– No R, A, I, N – good.  \n\nPattern 2: _ S _ E S  \nO must be in 1 or 3.  \nIf O is in 1: O S _ E S – but then we need another S in 3, but S cannot be in 3 (from NOSES feedback).  \nIf O is in 3: _ S O E S – then first letter must be S (to have second S).  \nThus: _ S O E S becomes S S O E S – “SSOES” – not valid.  \n\nTherefore the only valid word fitting all constraints is “SLOES”.\n\nLet’s confirm “SLOES”:\nS L O E S  \n- S in 1 and 5 – satisfies double-S (one in 5, one not in 3).  \n- O in 3 – allowed (not in 2).  \n- E in 4 – matches.  \n- No R, A, I, N – good.  \n- Valid 5-letter word (variant of “sloshes”).\n\n<guess>SLOES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 3: SLOES -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) O(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s decode the new feedback on SLOES:\n\nS(-) – S is in the word but not in position 1.  \nL(✓) – L is in position 2.  \nO(✓) – O is in position 3.  \nE(✓) – E is in position 4.  \nS(✓) – S is in position 5.\n\nSo the word is now fully determined except for the first letter:\n\n_ L O E S\n\nWe know:\n- Letters already placed: L, O, E, S.  \n- Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, N, S (for position 1).  \n- The first letter must be a consonant not yet used and must not be S (since S is only in position 5).  \n- Valid remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words ending in LOES:\n\nThe most common word is “CLOSE” – but C is allowed and fits.\n\nCheck constraints:\nC, L, O, S, E  \n- C not yet excluded.  \n- L, O, E, S positions match.  \n- No R, A, I, N.  \n- S only in position 5, which is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be “CLOSE”.\n\n<guess>CLOSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: NOSES -> FEEDBACK: N(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 3: SLOES -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(✓) O(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: CLOSE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s update what we know after the four guesses.\n\nKnown positions (✓):\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: O\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: S   (from Guess 2 and 3, but now Guess 4 shows S is NOT in position 5)\n\nWait!

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Positions that are locked:
   - 2 = L
   - 3 = O

2. Letters that are definitely in the word (and not yet placed):
   - S
   - E

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (from all guesses):
   - R, A, I, N, C, P

4. Position constraints:
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from feedback S(-) in every appearance so far).  
     That leaves only position 2 for S, but position 2 is already L.  
     This is impossible unless S appears twice and one instance is counted in another position.

   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5.  
     So E must be in position 1 or 3.  
     Position 3 is O, so E must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be:
E L O _ _

The only remaining letter to place is S, and the only remaining position is 4.

Hence the word is E L O S _.

We need a 5-letter word matching E L O S _.  
The only valid English word is “ELOSE”, but that is not in standard dictionaries.  
Rechecking: there is no common 5-letter word “ELOSE”.

This contradiction implies our earlier interpretation must be wrong.  
Re-examining Guess 4 and 5:

Guess 4: CLOSE → C(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(-)  
- L(✓) and O(✓) are correct.  
- S(-) means S is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Guess 5: SLOPE → S(-) L(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(-)  
- S(-) means S is NOT in position 1.  
- E(-) means E is NOT in position 5.

Combining all S placements:
- S must be in position 1 or 4 (from earlier guesses) but:
  - Not 1 (from SLOPE feedback)  
  - Not 4 (from CLOSE feedback)  
Thus S has nowhere left but position 5.

But Guess 4 showed S(-) which contradicts S(✓) from earlier.  
The only resolution is that S is in position 5 and the earlier S(-) in Guess 4 refers to it not being in position 4.

Therefore the word must be:
_ L O E S

We need a first letter that:
- Has not been ruled out: allowed letters are B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding already excluded R, A, I, N, C, P).  
- Forms a valid 5-letter word.

Common words fitting _ L O E S:  
- BLOES – not standard  
- DLOES – not standard  
- FLOES – valid (plural of “floe”)  
- GLOES – not standard  
- HLOES – not standard  
- KLOES – not standard  
- MLOES – not standard  
- TLOES – not standard  

The only valid dictionary word is “FLOES”.

Thus the secret word is FLOES.
