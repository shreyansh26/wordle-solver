For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and S somewhere.
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, Y) to test new letters.

Good candidates: ""DRIPS"", ""CRISP"", ""TRUST"", ""FIRST"", ""GRIST"", etc.
""DRIPS"" looks good because it:

Let's update what we know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, S (positions 2 and 4 respectively)

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - Letters NOT in the word: D, P
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the correct position (position 5)

3. FIRST → F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: F, T
   - I is in the correct position (position 2)
   - R is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know from guess 2 that S is in position 5)

So far we have:
- Word pattern: _ I _ _ S
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), R (somewhere except positions 2, 3), S (position 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, D, P, F, T
- Letters still available: B, C, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since I is locked in position 2 and S is locked in position 5, we need to place R in positions 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 3).

Possible patterns:
- R I _ _ S
- _ I _ R S

Looking for common words:
- R I _ _ S: ""RISE"" is 4 letters, ""RIVYS"" (not a word), ""RINSE"" (5 letters but E is out)
- _ I _ R S: ""MINOR"" (but O is out), ""WINCH"" (but H is not tested), ""LINER"" (but E is out), ""WINDS"" (but D is out)

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need 5-letter words ending in S, with I in position 2, and R in position 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- R I _ _ S: ""RIVRS"" (invalid), ""RINCS"" (not a word), ""RIBRS"" (invalid)
- _ I _ R S: ""WINRS"" (invalid), ""MINRS"" (invalid), ""LINRS"" (invalid)

Hmm, maybe I missed some. Let's think of actual words:
- ""RINSE"" - but E is out
- ""RIVYS"" - not a word
- ""RIGGS"" - but G is not confirmed
- ""RILLS"" - but L is not confirmed

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 4:
- _ I _ R S: ""MINOR"" - but O is out
- ""WINCH"" - but H is not confirmed
- ""LINER"" - but E is out
- ""QUIDS"" - but Q is not confirmed
- ""WISPS"" - but S is already in position 5

Actually, let's think of ""R"" in position 1:
- R I _ _ S: ""RIGID"" - but D is out
- ""RINSE"" - E is out
- ""RIVET"" - but T is out

This seems tricky. Maybe ""RIVRS"" is not a word. Let me think of actual valid words:
- ""RINSE"" - invalid (E)
- ""RIGGS"" - possible
- ""RILLS"" - possible
- ""RINCS"" - not a word

Looking at ""RILLS"":
- R I L L S
- Letters: R, I, L, L, S
- All letters are allowed (no A, O, E, D, P, F, T)
- R is in position 1 (not 2 or 3, so allowed)
- I is in position 2 (correct)
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- L is new but allowed

This seems valid. Another option is ""RIGGS"":
- R I G G S
- G is new but allowed
- But double G might be less likely

I'll go with ""RILLS"" as it uses common letters and fits all constraints.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ I _ _ S
- It must contain R and I (with I in position 2)
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S is in position 5
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, D, P, F, T

The word ""RILLS"" fits:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and S somewhere.
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, Y) to test new letters.

Good candidates: ""DRIPS"", ""CRISP"", ""TRUST"", ""FIRST"", ""GRIST"", etc.
""DRIPS"" looks good because it:
- Includes R and S (in new positions 3 and 5).
- Introduces D, I, P (new letters).
- Avoids A, O, E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, S (positions 2 and 4 respectively)

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - Letters not in the word: D, P
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the correct position (position 5)

So we now know:
- The word ends with S: _ _ _ _ S
- It contains R and I, but R is not in position 2 and I is not in position 3
- It does NOT contain A, O, E, D, P

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since A, O, E are out)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with R and I somewhere in the first four positions, and no forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- R _ I _ S
- R _ _ I S
- _ R I _ S
- _ R _ I S
- I _ R _ S
- I _ _ R S
- _ I R _ S
- _ I _ R S
- _ _ R I S
- _ _ I R S

Looking for common words:
- TRIPS: but P is out
- CRISP: P is out
- GRIST: G, R, I, S, T - all allowed
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K - all allowed
- FIRST: F, I, R, S, T - all allowed
- WRIST: W, R, I, S, T - all allowed
- GRITS: G, R, I, T, S - all allowed

""FIRST"" seems like a strong candidate because it:
- Ends with S
- Contains R and I
- R is in position 3 (not position 2, so allowed)
- I is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed)
- Uses F and T which are new letters to test

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- R and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R and S somewhere.
- Avoids A, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, Y) to test new letters.

Good candidates: ""DRIPS"", ""CRISP"", ""TRUST"", ""FIRST"", ""GRIST"", etc.
""DRIPS"" looks good because it:
- Includes R and S (in new positions 3 and 5).
- Introduces D, I, P (new letters).
- Avoids A, O, E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, S (positions 2 and 4 respectively)

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - Letters not in the word: D, P
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the correct position (position 5)

So we now know:
- The word ends with S: _ _ _ _ S
- It contains R and I, but R is not in position 2 and I is not in position 3
- It does NOT contain A, O, E, D, P

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels left: I, U, Y (since A, O, E are out)

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with R and I somewhere in the first four positions, and no forbidden letters.

Possible patterns:
- R _ I _ S
- R _ _ I S
- _ R I _ S
- _ R _ I S
- I _ R _ S
- I _ _ R S
- _ I R _ S
- _ I _ R S
- _ _ R I S
- _ _ I R S

Looking for common words:
- TRIPS: but P is out
- CRISP: P is out
- GRIST: G, R, I, S, T - all allowed
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K - all allowed
- FIRST: F, I, R, S, T - all allowed
- WRIST: W, R, I, S, T - all allowed
- GRITS: G, R, I, T, S - all allowed

""FIRST"" seems like a strong candidate because it:
- Ends with S
- Contains R and I
- R is in position 3 (not position 2, so allowed)
- I is in position 2 (not position 3, so allowed)
- Uses F and T which are new letters to test

Let's update what we know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E
   - Letters in the word but wrong place: R, S (positions 2 and 4 respectively)

2. DRIPS → D(x) R(-) I(-) P(x) S(✓)
   - Letters NOT in the word: D, P
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the correct position (position 5)

3. FIRST → F(x) I(✓) R(-) S(-) T(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: F, T
   - I is in the correct position (position 2)
   - R is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know from guess 2 that S is in position 5)

So far we have:
- Word pattern: _ I _ _ S
- Letters in the word: I (position 2), R (somewhere except positions 2, 3), S (position 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, D, P, F, T
- Letters still available: B, C, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Since I is locked in position 2 and S is locked in position 5, we need to place R in positions 1 or 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 3).

Possible patterns:
- R I _ _ S
- _ I _ R S

Looking for common words:
- R I _ _ S: ""RISE"" is 4 letters, ""RIVYS"" (not a word), ""RINSE"" (5 letters but E is out)
- _ I _ R S: ""MINOR"" (but O is out), ""WINCH"" (but H is not tested), ""LINER"" (but E is out), ""WINDS"" (but D is out)

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need 5-letter words ending in S, with I in position 2, and R in position 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- R I _ _ S: ""RIVRS"" (invalid), ""RINCS"" (not a word), ""RIBRS"" (invalid)
- _ I _ R S: ""WINRS"" (invalid), ""MINRS"" (invalid), ""LINRS"" (invalid)

Hmm, maybe I missed some. Let's think of actual words:
- ""RINSE"" - but E is out
- ""RIVYS"" - not a word
- ""RIGGS"" - but G is not confirmed
- ""RILLS"" - but L is not confirmed

Wait, let's think of words with R in position 4:
- _ I _ R S: ""MINOR"" - but O is out
- ""WINCH"" - but H is not confirmed
- ""LINER"" - but E is out
- ""QUIDS"" - but Q is not confirmed
- ""WISPS"" - but S is already in position 5

Actually, let's think of ""R"" in position 1:
- R I _ _ S: ""RIGID"" - but D is out
- ""RINSE"" - E is out
- ""RIVET"" - but T is out

This seems tricky. Maybe ""RIVRS"" is not a word. Let me think of actual valid words:
- ""RINSE"" - invalid (E)
- ""RIGGS"" - possible
- ""RILLS"" - possible
- ""RINCS"" - not a word

Looking at ""RILLS"":
- R I L L S
- Letters: R, I, L, L, S
- All letters are allowed (no A, O, E, D, P, F, T)
- R is in position 1 (not 2 or 3, so allowed)
- I is in position 2 (correct)
- S is in position 5 (correct)
- L is new but allowed

This seems valid. Another option is ""RIGGS"":
- R I G G S
- G is new but allowed
- But double G might be less likely

I'll go with ""RILLS"" as it uses common letters and fits all constraints.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has the pattern _ I _ _ S
- It must contain R and I (with I in position 2)
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- S is in position 5
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, D, P, F, T

The word ""RILLS"" fits:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (correct)
- L and L in positions 3 and 4 (new letters, allowed)
- S in position 5 (correct)
