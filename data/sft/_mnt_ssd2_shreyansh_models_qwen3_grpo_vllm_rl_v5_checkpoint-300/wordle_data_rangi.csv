For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,4,5 could be A or R, but A not first, R not second.

A strong next guess is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 - so this is bad).

Oops, ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 which we know is wrong. Let's avoid that.

Next try ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

Try ""RADIO"" - O is excluded.

- I(-): I is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).

So we now know:
1. The word starts with ""RA"".
2. The word contains I, but I is not in position 4.
3. The word does NOT contain O, S, E, B, or D.

Remaining letters to consider: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""RA"" that:
- Contains I (but not in position 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, B, or D.

Possible positions for I: 3 or 5.

Let's think of words starting with ""RA"" and containing I:
- RAIL? - but we need 5 letters.
- RATIO - contains O (invalid).
- RAJIN - possible.
- RAKIN - possible.
- RALIF - possible.
- RAMIN - possible.
- RAVIN - possible.

Looking for common words:
- RAVIN - ""ravin"" is a valid word (means to erode or wear away).
- RAKIN - less common.
- RAMIN - less common.
- RAVEN - contains E (invalid).
- RAINS - contains S (invalid).

""RAVIN"" seems like the best next guess as it fits all constraints:
- Starts with RA.
- Contains I (in position 3, not 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, B, or D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,4,5 could be A or R, but A not first, R not second.

A strong next guess is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 - so this is bad).

Oops, ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 which we know is wrong. Let's avoid that.

Next try ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

Try ""RADIO"" - O is excluded.

Try ""RAILS"" - S is excluded.

Try ""RANCH"" - good, but let's see.

Better: ""RATIO"" is out (O), ""RANCH"" is possible but let's try ""RADIO"" is out (O).

Let's try ""RATIO"" again - no, O is out.

Let's try ""RAILS"" - S is out.

Let's try ""RABID"":
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 1 (not 2) - this fits.

""RABID"" seems good.

Alternatively ""RACON"" - but O is out.

""RADIO"" - O is out.

""RAILS"" - S is out.

""RABID"" seems best.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains five very common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. However, another strong option is ""SLATE"" which also covers common letters. After considering these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, D, C, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

Possible structure: positions 1,3,4,5 could be A or R, but A not first, R not second.

A strong next guess is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 4 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 - so this is bad).

Oops, ""TRAIN"" has R in position 2 which we know is wrong. Let's avoid that.

Next try ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

Try ""RADIO"" - O is excluded.

Try ""RAILS"" - S is excluded.

Try ""RANCH"" - good, but let's see.

Better: ""RATIO"" is out (O), ""RANCH"" is possible but let's try ""RADIO"" is out (O).

Let's try ""RATIO"" again - no, O is out.

Let's try ""RAILS"" - S is out.

Let's try ""RABID"":
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 1 (not 2) - this fits.

""RABID"" seems good.

Alternatively ""RACON"" - but O is out.

""RADIO"" - O is out.

""RAILS"" - S is out.

""RABID"" seems best.

From the new feedback on RABID:
- R(✓): R is in position 1 (exact match).
- A(✓): A is in position 2 (exact match).
- B(x), D(x): B and D are NOT in the word.
- I(-): I is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).

So we now know:
1. The word starts with ""RA"".
2. The word contains I, but I is not in position 4.
3. The word does NOT contain O, S, E, B, or D.

Remaining letters to consider: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with ""RA"" that:
- Contains I (but not in position 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, B, or D.

Possible positions for I: 3 or 5.

Let's think of words starting with ""RA"" and containing I:
- RAIL? - but we need 5 letters.
- RATIO - contains O (invalid).
- RAJIN - possible.
- RAKIN - possible.
- RALIF - possible.
- RAMIN - possible.
- RAVIN - possible.

Looking for common words:
- RAVIN - ""ravin"" is a valid word (means to erode or wear away).
- RAKIN - less common.
- RAMIN - less common.
- RAVEN - contains E (invalid).
- RAINS - contains S (invalid).

""RAVIN"" seems like the best next guess as it fits all constraints:
- Starts with RA.
- Contains I (in position 3, not 4).
- Does not contain O, S, E, B, or D.

Current knowledge:

   - A is fixed in position 2
   - I is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 4 from guess 2 and 3)
   - N is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
3. Letters eliminated: O, S, E, B, D, V
4. Remaining letters to try: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

From the feedback on RAVIN:
- I(-): I is in the word but not in position 4
- N(-): N is in the word but not in position 5

So possible positions:
- I must be in position 3 or 5
- N must be in position 3 or 4

Possible combinations:
Case 1: I in position 3
   Then N must be in position 4
   Word: R A I N _

Case 2: I in position 5
   Then N must be in position 3 or 4
   Word: R A _ N I or R A _ _ N I (but second is impossible as 5-letter)

So possible words:
- RAIN? - needs 5 letters
- RAIN_ - last letter must be from remaining letters (C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z)

Looking at RAIN?, possible 5-letter words:
- RAINS - but S is eliminated
- RAINY - Y is possible
- RAIND - but D is eliminated
- RAINB - B is eliminated

""RAINY"" seems valid:
- R A I N Y
- Contains all required letters (R,A,I,N,Y)

- Fits all positional constraints
