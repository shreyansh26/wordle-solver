For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes both O and S.
- Excludes A, R, E.
- Places O and S in different positions than before.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves O and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters.

But we need to check: does SOUND have any of the excluded letters? No A, R, E. Good.

However, SOUND has O in position 2, which is a new position from original position 3. S is in position 1, new from position 4. This seems valid.

But let me think of another: ""SLOTH"" has S and O, but also T, L, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""SOLID"" - S, O, L, I, D. But this has O in position 2 again.

""SPOIL"" - S, P, O, I, L. O in position 3 again, which was original position of O (wrong), so this is bad.

""STONY"" - S, T, O, N, Y. O in position 3 again, bad.

""STOIC"" - S, T, O, I, C. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SOILY"" - S, O, I, L, Y. O in position 2, S in position 1. This seems good.

But ""SOILY"" is less common. 

""STOKE"" - but E is excluded.

""STOCK"" - C is okay, but K is less common.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOOP"" - double O, but O is okay, but P is less common.

""SOUND"" seems better, even if less common.

Wait, ""SOUND"" is valid and meets all criteria.

But let me try ""SOUTH"" - S, O, U, T, H. O in position 2, S in position 1. No excluded letters. H is acceptable.

But ""SOUTH"" is good.

Another: ""SULKY"" - S, U, L, K, Y. No O, so bad.

""SUING"" - S, U, I, N, G. No O, bad.

""STONY"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOOP"" - O in 3, bad.

""STORM"" - R excluded.

""STOUP"" - P okay, but uncommon.

""SOUND"" seems the best among options.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" again - S, L, O, T, H. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T. O in position 3, bad.

""STOUP"" - S, T, O, U, P. O in position 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - same.

So seems like O is often in position 3 in common words. Need to move it elsewhere.

""SOCKO"" - slang, but valid. O in 5, S in 1. No excluded letters. Good.

""SOCKO"" is valid.

""SOCKO"" - S(1), O(5), C(2), K(3), O(4). But double O.

""SOCKO"" is acceptable.

But let me try ""SULKY"" - no O.

""SUING"" - no O.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOIC"" - O in 3.

""STOOP"" - O in 3.

""STOUP"" - O in 3.

""SOUND"" - O in 2, S in 1. This seems best.

""SOUTH"" - O in 2, S in 1.

""SOUND"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""SOUND"".

Based on the feedback:
- A, R, E are not in the word.
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (O not in position 3, S not in position 4).

A good next guess is ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters to test.
- No A, R, E are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes both O and S.
- Excludes A, R, E.
- Places O and S in different positions than before.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves O and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters.

But we need to check: does SOUND have any of the excluded letters? No A, R, E. Good.

However, SOUND has O in position 2, which is a new position from original position 3. S is in position 1, new from position 4. This seems valid.

But let me think of another: ""SLOTH"" has S and O, but also T, L, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""SOLID"" - S, O, L, I, D. But this has O in position 2 again.

""SPOIL"" - S, P, O, I, L. O in position 3 again, which was original position of O (wrong), so this is bad.

""STONY"" - S, T, O, N, Y. O in position 3 again, bad.

""STOIC"" - S, T, O, I, C. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SOILY"" - S, O, I, L, Y. O in position 2, S in position 1. This seems good.

But ""SOILY"" is less common. 

""STOKE"" - but E is excluded.

""STOCK"" - C is okay, but K is less common.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOOP"" - double O, but O is okay, but P is less common.

""SOUND"" seems better, even if less common.

Wait, ""SOUND"" is valid and meets all criteria.

But let me try ""SOUTH"" - S, O, U, T, H. O in position 2, S in position 1. No excluded letters. H is acceptable.

But ""SOUTH"" is good.

Another: ""SULKY"" - S, U, L, K, Y. No O, so bad.

""SUING"" - S, U, I, N, G. No O, bad.

""STONY"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOOP"" - O in 3, bad.

""STORM"" - R excluded.

""STOUP"" - P okay, but uncommon.

""SOUND"" seems the best among options.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" again - S, L, O, T, H. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T. O in position 3, bad.

""STOUP"" - S, T, O, U, P. O in position 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - same.

So seems like O is often in position 3 in common words. Need to move it elsewhere.

""SOCKO"" - slang, but valid. O in 5, S in 1. No excluded letters. Good.

""SOCKO"" is valid.

""SOCKO"" - S(1), O(5), C(2), K(3), O(4). But double O.

""SOCKO"" is acceptable.

But let me try ""SULKY"" - no O.

""SUING"" - no O.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOIC"" - O in 3.

""STOOP"" - O in 3.

""STOUP"" - O in 3.

""SOUND"" - O in 2, S in 1. This seems best.

""SOUTH"" - O in 2, S in 1.

""SOUND"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""SOUND"".Based on the feedback:
- A, R, E are not in the word.
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (O not in position 3, S not in position 4).

A good next guess is ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters to test.
- No A, R, E are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes both O and S.
- Excludes A, R, E.
- Places O and S in different positions than before.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves O and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters.

But we need to check: does SOUND have any of the excluded letters? No A, R, E. Good.

However, SOUND has O in position 2, which is a new position from original position 3. S is in position 1, new from position 4. This seems valid.

But let me think of another: ""SLOTH"" has S and O, but also T, L, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""SOLID"" - S, O, L, I, D. But this has O in position 2 again.

""SPOIL"" - S, P, O, I, L. O in position 3 again, which was original position of O (wrong), so this is bad.

""STONY"" - S, T, O, N, Y. O in position 3 again, bad.

""STOIC"" - S, T, O, I, C. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SOILY"" - S, O, I, L, Y. O in position 2, S in position 1. This seems good.

But ""SOILY"" is less common. 

""STOKE"" - but E is excluded.

""STOCK"" - C is okay, but K is less common.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOOP"" - double O, but O is okay, but P is less common.

""SOUND"" seems better, even if less common.

Wait, ""SOUND"" is valid and meets all criteria.

But let me try ""SOUTH"" - S, O, U, T, H. O in position 2, S in position 1. No excluded letters. H is acceptable.

But ""SOUTH"" is good.

Another: ""SULKY"" - S, U, L, K, Y. No O, so bad.

""SUING"" - S, U, I, N, G. No O, bad.

""STONY"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOOP"" - O in 3, bad.

""STORM"" - R excluded.

""STOUP"" - P okay, but uncommon.

""SOUND"" seems the best among options.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" again - S, L, O, T, H. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T. O in position 3, bad.

""STOUP"" - S, T, O, U, P. O in position 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - same.

So seems like O is often in position 3 in common words. Need to move it elsewhere.

""SOCKO"" - slang, but valid. O in 5, S in 1. No excluded letters. Good.

""SOCKO"" is valid.

""SOCKO"" - S(1), O(5), C(2), K(3), O(4). But double O.

""SOCKO"" is acceptable.

But let me try ""SULKY"" - no O.

""SUING"" - no O.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOIC"" - O in 3.

""STOOP"" - O in 3.

""STOUP"" - O in 3.

""SOUND"" - O in 2, S in 1. This seems best.

""SOUTH"" - O in 2, S in 1.

""SOUND"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""SOUND"".Based on the feedback:
- A, R, E are not in the word.
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (O not in position 3, S not in position 4).

A good next guess is ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters to test.
- No A, R, E are used.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, E are not in the word.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O is in position 2 (✓) → so the word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
   – U and D are not in the word.
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

Known facts so far:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), S, N
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, D
- S is not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
- N is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, N, or another consonant (since N could be first)
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and N somewhere else
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, E, U, D)

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place S and N:
- If S is in position 3: _ O S _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ _ S
- N could then be in remaining valid positions.

Candidate words:
- S O N _ _ → SONIC (but C is okay, I is okay)
- _ O N S _ → CONSC (invalid)
- _ O S N _ → possible: TONSS (invalid), PONDS (D excluded)
- _ O _ S N → possible: BONSN (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words matching _ O _ _ _ with S and N, no excluded letters.

Examples:
- SONIC: S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in 1) → invalid
- SONAR: A excluded → invalid
- SONDE: D, E excluded → invalid
- SONGS: S in 1 (invalid), G okay
- SONS: too short
- TONIC: T, O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is missing → invalid
- CONIC: C, O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is missing → invalid
- PONCY: C, Y okay, but no S → invalid
- SONGO: G okay, but S in 1 (invalid)
- SONS: too short
- SONS: invalid
- SONS: invalid

Wait, let me think differently: S must be in 3 or 5, N must be in 1,3,5.

Try:
- N O S _ _: N(1), O(2), S(3), _ , _
   – Possible: NOSKY (K,Y okay), NOSIL (I,L okay), NOSUM (U excluded)
   – NOSKY: N, O, S, K, Y → valid
- _ O S N _: 
   – Possible: TOSN_ (invalid), LOSN_ (invalid)
- _ O _ S N:
   – Possible: B O I S N (invalid), M O T S N (invalid)

Best candidate seems NOSKY:
- N O S K Y
   – O in 2 (✓)
   – S in 3 (allowed, since S is not in 1 or 4)
   – N in 1 (allowed, since N is not in 4)
   – No excluded letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains O and S.
2. O is not in position 3.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes both O and S.
- Excludes A, R, E.
- Places O and S in different positions than before.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try a word that moves O and S to new positions and adds new common letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters.

But we need to check: does SOUND have any of the excluded letters? No A, R, E. Good.

However, SOUND has O in position 2, which is a new position from original position 3. S is in position 1, new from position 4. This seems valid.

But let me think of another: ""SLOTH"" has S and O, but also T, L, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""SOLID"" - S, O, L, I, D. But this has O in position 2 again.

""SPOIL"" - S, P, O, I, L. O in position 3 again, which was original position of O (wrong), so this is bad.

""STONY"" - S, T, O, N, Y. O in position 3 again, bad.

""STOIC"" - S, T, O, I, C. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SOILY"" - S, O, I, L, Y. O in position 2, S in position 1. This seems good.

But ""SOILY"" is less common. 

""STOKE"" - but E is excluded.

""STOCK"" - C is okay, but K is less common.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOOP"" - double O, but O is okay, but P is less common.

""SOUND"" seems better, even if less common.

Wait, ""SOUND"" is valid and meets all criteria.

But let me try ""SOUTH"" - S, O, U, T, H. O in position 2, S in position 1. No excluded letters. H is acceptable.

But ""SOUTH"" is good.

Another: ""SULKY"" - S, U, L, K, Y. No O, so bad.

""SUING"" - S, U, I, N, G. No O, bad.

""STONY"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - O in 3, bad.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOOP"" - O in 3, bad.

""STORM"" - R excluded.

""STOUP"" - P okay, but uncommon.

""SOUND"" seems the best among options.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" again - S, L, O, T, H. O in position 3 again, bad.

""SNOUT"" - S, N, O, U, T. O in position 3, bad.

""STOUP"" - S, T, O, U, P. O in position 3, bad.

""STOIC"" - same.

So seems like O is often in position 3 in common words. Need to move it elsewhere.

""SOCKO"" - slang, but valid. O in 5, S in 1. No excluded letters. Good.

""SOCKO"" is valid.

""SOCKO"" - S(1), O(5), C(2), K(3), O(4). But double O.

""SOCKO"" is acceptable.

But let me try ""SULKY"" - no O.

""SUING"" - no O.

""STUMP"" - no O.

""STOKE"" - E excluded.

""STOCK"" - C okay.

""STOIC"" - O in 3.

""STOOP"" - O in 3.

""STOUP"" - O in 3.

""SOUND"" - O in 2, S in 1. This seems best.

""SOUTH"" - O in 2, S in 1.

""SOUND"" is more common.

Thus, I'll go with ""SOUND"".Based on the feedback:
- A, R, E are not in the word.
- O and S are in the word but in the wrong positions (O not in position 3, S not in position 4).

A good next guess is ""SOUND"":
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- O is in position 2 (new position).
- U, N, D are new letters to test.
- No A, R, E are used.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, E are not in the word.
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(x)
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.
   – O is in position 2 (✓) → so the word has the pattern _ O _ _ _
   – U and D are not in the word.
   – N is in the word but not in position 4.

Known facts so far:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), S, N
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, U, D
- S is not in positions 1 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
- N is not in position 4 → possible positions: 1, 3, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, N, or another consonant (since N could be first)
- Has O in position 2
- Contains S and N somewhere else
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, E, U, D)

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place S and N:
- If S is in position 3: _ O S _ _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ _ S
- N could then be in remaining valid positions.

Candidate words:
- S O N _ _ → SONIC (but C is okay, I is okay)
- _ O N S _ → CONSC (invalid)
- _ O S N _ → possible: TONSS (invalid), PONDS (D excluded)
- _ O _ S N → possible: BONSN (invalid)

Better approach: look for common words matching _ O _ _ _ with S and N, no excluded letters.

Examples:
- SONIC: S(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is in position 1 (but feedback says S is not in 1) → invalid
- SONAR: A excluded → invalid
- SONDE: D, E excluded → invalid
- SONGS: S in 1 (invalid), G okay
- SONS: too short
- TONIC: T, O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is missing → invalid
- CONIC: C, O(2), N(3), I(4), C(5)
   – S is missing → invalid
- PONCY: C, Y okay, but no S → invalid
- SONGO: G okay, but S in 1 (invalid)
- SONS: too short
- SONS: invalid
- SONS: invalid

Wait, let me think differently: S must be in 3 or 5, N must be in 1,3,5.

Try:
- N O S _ _: N(1), O(2), S(3), _ , _
   – Possible: NOSKY (K,Y okay), NOSIL (I,L okay), NOSUM (U excluded)
   – NOSKY: N, O, S, K, Y → valid
- _ O S N _: 
   – Possible: TOSN_ (invalid), LOSN_ (invalid)
- _ O _ S N:
   – Possible: B O I S N (invalid), M O T S N (invalid)

Best candidate seems NOSKY:
- N O S K Y
   – O in 2 (✓)
   – S in 3 (allowed, since S is not in 1 or 4)
   – N in 1 (allowed, since N is not in 4)
   – No excluded letters

Let's consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, E, U, D, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - so far):
- O – locked in position 2 (✓)
- S – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 (from NOSKY feedback S(-) in position 3 and from SOUND S(-) in position 1, and from AROSE S(-) in position 4). Therefore S must be in position 5.
- N – in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4 (from SOUND N(-) in position 4 and from NOSKY N(-) in position 1). Therefore N must be in position 3.
- K – in the word (✓) but position unknown so far.

Current pattern:
_ O N _ S   (because N must be in 3 and S must be in 5)

Letters still allowed: any letters not yet ruled out (basically everything except A, R, E, U, D, Y).

We also know K is somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since positions 2,3,5 are taken by O, N, S).

So possible words:
- K O N _ S
- _ O N K S

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- KONIS – not a word
- KONKS – not a word
- KONOS – not common
- BONUS – B, O, N, U, S – but U is excluded
- CONES – E excluded
- FONDS – D excluded
- TONKS – T, O, N, K, S – valid word!

TONKS:

We now know the pattern is: _ O N K S

Looking at the English alphabet, the only remaining single letter that forms a valid 5-letter word beginning with that letter and matching the pattern is:

C O N K S → “CONKS”

All other candidates (F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) either do not form recognized words or are not common.

Therefore, the secret word must be CONKS.
