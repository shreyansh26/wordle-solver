For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include: A, E, T, R, S, N, L, I, O, C. 

A strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good starting point to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x)
- O, S, E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, E
2. Does NOT contain A or R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Contains S, T, O, N, E
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- E moves from position 5 to 5 (but this is the same as before, so this is bad)

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- Contains S, P, O, K, E
- S at 1, O at 3, E at 5 (same as AROSE, so E and O are still in wrong positions)

Try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D
- O at 2, S at 3, E at 4
- This moves all three letters to new positions (O-2, S-3, E-4) compared to AROSE (O-3, S-4, E-5)
- Also introduces new letters P and D which haven't been tested yet

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for O, S, E and adds two new letters.

- _ O _ E S: ""TOLES"" – but L hasn't been tested, T is common
- _ O _ E S: ""HOSES"" – but H hasn't been tested, and we have double S
- _ O _ E S: ""MOSES"" – M is possible, but double S again
- _ O _ E S: ""WOES"" – too short
- _ O _ E S: ""GOES"" – but we need 5 letters

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include: A, E, T, R, S, N, L, I, O, C. 

A strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good starting point to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x)
- O, S, E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, E
2. Does NOT contain A or R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Contains S, T, O, N, E
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- E moves from position 5 to 5 (but this is the same as before, so this is bad)

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- Contains S, P, O, K, E
- S at 1, O at 3, E at 5 (same as AROSE, so E and O are still in wrong positions)

Try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D
- O at 2, S at 3, E at 4
- This moves all three letters to new positions (O-2, S-3, E-4) compared to AROSE (O-3, S-4, E-5)
- Also introduces new letters P and D which haven't been tested yet

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for O, S, E and adds two new letters.

Guess 2: POSED -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) S(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POSED:
- P and D are NOT in the word (x)
- O is now in the CORRECT position (✓) – position 2
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5
- E is in the CORRECT position (✓) – position 4

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D
- Remaining possible positions for S: 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is already ruled out by POSED feedback, so 1 or 5)
- Other letters to consider: common consonants like T, N, L, C, K, M, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2
2. Has E in position 4
3. Has S in position 1 or 5
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D)

Let’s try ""S O _ E _"":
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

Let’s think of valid words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOBER"" – but B hasn't been tested, and R is ruled out
- _ O _ E S: ""TOLES"" – but L hasn't been tested, T is common
- _ O _ E S: ""HOSES"" – but H hasn't been tested, and we have double S
- _ O _ E S: ""MOSES"" – M is possible, but double S again
- _ O _ E S: ""WOES"" – too short
- _ O _ E S: ""GOES"" – but we need 5 letters

Wait, let me think better:
Actually, the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and S somewhere else (1 or 5).

Possible structures:
1. S O _ E _
2. _ O _ E S

Looking at structure 1: S O _ E _
Possible letters for position 3: common ones like T, N, L, C, K, M
Possible letters for position 5: same

Let’s try ""SONIC"" – but C is possible, but we need E in position 4, so ""SONEC"" is invalid
Wait, structure is S O _ E _, so position 3 and 5 are free
Let me think of words fitting S O _ E _:
- ""SONIC"" – no, E is in 4, so ""SON_E""
- ""SOLER"" – but R is ruled out
- ""SOWER"" – R is ruled out
- ""SOYEL"" – but Y is possible, L is possible
But this seems forced.

Looking at structure 2: _ O _ E S
Possible letters for position 1: common ones like T, N, L, C, M
Possible letters for position 3: same

Let’s try ""TOLES"" – but is this a valid word? It means ""a coin"" but might be obscure
""NOVES"" – not a common word
""LOVES"" – this is a valid word, and L hasn't been tested, V hasn't been tested, but we have S in position 5, O in 2, E in 4
Check letters: L, O, V, E, S – none are ruled out except V hasn't been tested
But we have S in position 5, which is allowed (was in position 3 before, now moving to 5)

Let me verify:
- L: not ruled out
- O: correct position 2
- V: not ruled out
- E: correct position 4
- S: moving from position 3 to 5, which is allowed

This seems valid.

Alternatively, ""COVES"" – but C is possible, but we have V
""MOVES"" – M is possible, V is possible
But ""LOVES"" seems more common.

Let me choose ""LOVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- E is correctly placed in position 4
- S must be placed in position 1 or 5 (currently in 3)
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D

The word ""LOVES"" fits:

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
_  O  _  E  S

Letters already ruled out: A, R, P, D, L, V

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2
2. Has E in position 4
3. Has S in position 5
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D, L, V)

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: common consonants like T, N, C, K, M, etc.

Possible structures:
- T or N or C or K or M in position 1
- Any remaining letter (not ruled out) in position 3

Let me think of valid words fitting this pattern:
- T O _ E S: ""TOUES"" – not a word
- T O N E S – ""TONES"" – valid word, N not ruled out
- C O _ E S: ""COVES"" – V is ruled out
- C O N E S – ""CONES"" – valid, N not ruled out
- M O _ E S: ""MOSES"" – but S is already in position 5, double S
- M O N E S – ""MONES"" – not common
- T O K E S – ""TOKES"" – valid, K not ruled out
- N O T E S – ""NOTES"" – valid, T not ruled out

The most common and likely word fitting this pattern is ""NOTES"":
- N in position 1
- O in position 2
- T in position 3
- E in position 4
- S in position 5

Let me verify:
- N: not ruled out
- O: correct position 2
- T: not ruled out
- E: correct position 4
- S: correct position 5

This seems perfect.Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ O _ E S with S in position 5, O in position 2, and E in position 4. The letters ruled out are A, R, P, D, L, V. The most common word fitting this pattern is ""NOTES"".

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps us quickly eliminate or confirm many possible letters. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels.

Common letters in 5-letter English words include: A, E, T, R, S, N, L, I, O, C. 

A strong first guess would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This provides a good starting point to gather information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A and R are NOT in the word (x)
- O, S, E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters O, S, and E, but none of them are in the positions they occupied in AROSE (positions 3, 4, 5 respectively).

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, S, E
2. Does NOT contain A or R
3. Places O, S, E in different positions than 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to place these letters in new positions and fill the remaining slots with other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is ""STONE"":
- Contains S, T, O, N, E
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- O moves from position 3 to 2
- E moves from position 5 to 5 (but this is the same as before, so this is bad)

Next try ""SPOKE"":
- Contains S, P, O, K, E
- S at 1, O at 3, E at 5 (same as AROSE, so E and O are still in wrong positions)

Try ""POSED"":
- Contains P, O, S, E, D
- O at 2, S at 3, E at 4
- This moves all three letters to new positions (O-2, S-3, E-4) compared to AROSE (O-3, S-4, E-5)
- Also introduces new letters P and D which haven't been tested yet

This seems optimal as it tests new positions for O, S, E and adds two new letters.

From the new feedback on POSED:
- P and D are NOT in the word (x)
- O is now in the CORRECT position (✓) – position 2
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 4, or 5
- E is in the CORRECT position (✓) – position 4

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere else)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, P, D
- Remaining possible positions for S: 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is already ruled out by POSED feedback, so 1 or 5)
- Other letters to consider: common consonants like T, N, L, C, K, M, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Has O in position 2
2. Has E in position 4
3. Has S in position 1 or 5
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, P, D)

Let’s try ""S O _ E _"":
- If S is in position 1: S O _ E _
- If S is in position 5: _ O _ E S

Let’s think of valid words:
- S O _ E _: ""SOBER"" – but B hasn't been tested, and R is ruled out
- _ O _ E S: ""TOLES"" – but L hasn't been tested, T is common
- _ O _ E S: ""HOSES"" – but H hasn't been tested, and we have double S
- _ O _ E S: ""MOSES"" – M is possible, but double S again
- _ O _ E S: ""WOES"" – too short
- _ O _ E S: ""GOES"" – but we need 5 letters

Wait, let me think better:
Actually, the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and S somewhere else (1 or 5).

Possible structures:
1. S O _ E _
2. _ O _ E S

Looking at structure 1: S O _ E _
Possible letters for position 3: common ones like T, N, L, C, K, M
Possible letters for position 5: same

Let’s try ""SONIC"" – but C is possible, but we need E in position 4, so ""SONEC"" is invalid
Wait, structure is S O _ E _, so position 3 and 5 are free
Let me think of words fitting S O _ E _:
- ""SONIC"" – no, E is in 4, so ""SON_E""
- ""SOLER"" – but R is ruled out
- ""SOWER"" – R is ruled out
- ""SOYEL"" – but Y is possible, L is possible
But this seems forced.

Looking at structure 2: _ O _ E S
Possible letters for position 1: common ones like T, N, L, C, M
Possible letters for position 3: same

Let’s try ""TOLES"" – but is this a valid word? It means ""a coin"" but might be obscure
""NOVES"" – not a common word
""LOVES"" – this is a valid word, and L hasn't been tested, V hasn't been tested, but we have S in position 5, O in 2, E in 4
Check letters: L, O, V, E, S – none are ruled out except V hasn't been tested
But we have S in position 5, which is allowed (was in position 3 before, now moving to 5)

Let me verify:
- L: not ruled out
- O: correct position 2
- V: not ruled out
- E: correct position 4
- S: moving from position 3 to 5, which is allowed

This seems valid.

Alternatively, ""COVES"" – but C is possible, but we have V
""MOVES"" – M is possible, V is possible
But ""LOVES"" seems more common.

Let me choose ""LOVES"" as the next guess.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- E is correctly placed in position 4
- S must be placed in position 1 or 5 (currently in 3)
- Letters not in the word: A, R, P, D

The word ""LOVES"" fits:
- L (new letter)
- O (correct position 2)
- V (new letter)

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: common consonants like T, N, C, K, M, etc.

Possible structures:

- Any remaining letter (not ruled out) in position 3

Let me think of valid words fitting this pattern:

- M O N E S – ""MONES"" – not common
- T O K E S – ""TOKES"" – valid, K not ruled out

Looking at the pattern _ O T E S, the valid English word is ""HOTES"" (but this isn't standard), ""BOTES"" (not valid), ""DOTES"" (D is ruled out), ""GOTES"" (not valid), ""MOTES"" (valid word), ""WOTES"" (not valid).

The valid word fitting this pattern is ""MOTES"":
- M in position 1 (not ruled out)
- O in position 2
- T in position 3
- E in position 4
- S in position 5The pattern is now _ O T E S. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""MOTES"".

The feedback from MOTES shows that M is NOT in the word, but the last four letters are locked in as O T E S.  
So the pattern is now simply: _ O T E S.

Letters already ruled out for the first position: A, R, P, D, L, V, N, M.

The only common English 5-letter word that fits _ O T E S and uses an allowed first letter is:

C O T E S → “COTES” (a valid variant spelling of “coats” in some contexts, but more importantly, the actual word “COTES” exists as a plural form of “cote” in Scots or as an archaic term).

However, the most straightforward and unambiguous valid word fitting this pattern is “COTES”.

Since no other obvious word remains, we make that guess.
