For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words are: SLATE, CRANE, STARE, ARISE, or CRISP. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are all not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S but NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess would:
1. Keep the S but move it to a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E).

Possible good candidates: 
- RISON (R, I, S, O, N) – uses S in position 3, and tests R, I, O, N.
- CRISP – but P is less common, and we already ruled out T and A.
- SNORT – but T is out.
- SORRY – but R is repeated.

RISON seems best: it tests S (moved to position 3), plus common letters R, I, O, N.

DICOS seems best: it uses S (position 3), I (position 2), O (position 5), plus new letters D and C.  
But wait – I cannot be in position 2 (from RISON feedback). So DICOS is invalid.

Next candidate:  
- CLOUD – but U is a vowel we haven't tested, and it introduces C, L (ruled out), O, U, D. L is out, so skip.  

- MISO? – too short.  

- PISO? – not a word.  

- CHOPS – C, H, O, P, S.  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - O is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - I is missing – we need to test I. So skip.  

- CHIPS – C, H, I, P, S.  
  - I is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - New letters C, H, P.  

This seems good: it tests I in position 3, S in position 5, and introduces C, H, P.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are IN the word and their positions:
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that are IN the word but whose positions are NOT yet fixed:
- None, because I and S are now locked in positions 3 and 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, R, N, C, H, P

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ S  
and it must use only letters that have NOT been ruled out.

Remaining common consonants to try: B, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels to try: U (since A, E ruled out, I and O already placed)

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 2, and position 4.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ S and use only allowed letters:

- B I D G S – not a valid word.
- B I G G S – “BIGGS” is a proper noun, not allowed.
- D I V O S – “DIVOS” is not a standard word.
- D I M P S – P is ruled out.
- F I V E S – E is ruled out.
- G I V E S – E is ruled out.
- K I V I S – “KIVIS” is not a word.
- M I K I S – “MIKIS” is not standard.
- V I D D S – not a word.
- W I D D S – not a word.
- D I O S – too short.
- B I O S – too short.

- G I O S – not a word.
- F I O S – not a word.
- D I U S – “DIUS” is not a word.
- M I U S – not a word.
- G I U S – not a word.
- K I U S – not a word.
- V I U S – not a word.
- B I U S – not a word.
- F I U S – not a word.
- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try common consonants in positions 1 and 2 and see if any valid word pops up:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I G G S – invalid.
- D I G G S – invalid.
- F I G G S – invalid.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe we need to try different consonants:

- B I G S – too short.
- B I S – too short.
- D I S – too short.
- F I S – too short.
- G I S – too short.
- K I S – too short.
- M I S – too short.
- V I S – too short.
- W I S – too short.

Wait, let’s think of 5-letter words ending in “I_S” with S in position 5 and I in position 3:

- B I D G E – E is out.
- B I G S – too short.
- B I V E S – E is out.
- D I V O S – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, so invalid.
- F I V E S – E is out.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to try “U” in position 4:

- B I U S – not a word.
- D I U S – not a word.
- F I U S – not a word.
- G I U S – not a word.
- K I U S – not a word.
- M I U S – not a word.
- V I U S – not a word.
- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try “B” in position 1 and “D” in position 2:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I D S – too short.
- B I D _ S – not working.

How about “F” in position 1 and “I” in position 2 – but I is already in position 3.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? I ? S

Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): B, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, O

Possible words:
- B O I D S – “BOIDS” is a biological term (a type of fish), but it’s uncommon.
- D O I L S – L is out.
- F O I D S – “FOIDS” is not a word.
- G O I D S – not a word.
- K O I S – too short.
- M O I S – not a word.
- V O I D S – “VOIDS” is a valid word!
- W O I D S – not a word.
- B U I L S – L is out.
- D U I L S – L is out.

- G U I L S – L is out.
- K U I L S – L is out.
- M U I L S – L is out.
- V U I L S – L is out.
- W U I L S – L is out.

“VOIDS” seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern _ _ I _ S with allowed letters.

Let’s check:
- V (position 1) – not ruled out.
- O (position 2) – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, but here O is in position 2 – allowed.
- I (position 3) – confirmed ✓.
- D (position 4) – not ruled out.
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓.

This fits perfectly.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words are: SLATE, CRANE, STARE, ARISE, or CRISP. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are all not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S but NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess would:
1. Keep the S but move it to a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E).

Possible good candidates: 
- RISON (R, I, S, O, N) – uses S in position 3, and tests R, I, O, N.
- CRISP – but P is less common, and we already ruled out T and A.
- SNORT – but T is out.
- SORRY – but R is repeated.

RISON seems best: it tests S (moved to position 3), plus common letters R, I, O, N.

- R and N are absent.  
- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- O is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know the word contains: S, I, O.  
Positions ruled out for them:  
- S cannot be 1 or 3.  
- I cannot be 2.  
- O cannot be 4.

Letters completely ruled out: L, A, T, E, R, N.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since we already have I, O, and A, E ruled out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (2, 4, or 5).  
2. Place I and O in new positions.  
3. Introduce new common letters (C, D, G, H, K, M, P, U).  
4. Avoid all ruled-out letters.

Candidate words:  
- DICOS – but C and D are good letters, and it places I, O, S in new spots.  
- SHOCK – but H and C are good, and it uses S in position 1 (ruled out).  
- COSMIC – too long.  
- DICOT – T is out.  
- SHOGI – G and H are good, but O is in position 4 (ruled out).  

DICOS seems best: it uses S (position 3), I (position 2), O (position 5), plus new letters D and C.  
But wait – I cannot be in position 2 (from RISON feedback). So DICOS is invalid.

Next candidate:  
- CLOUD – but U is a vowel we haven't tested, and it introduces C, L (ruled out), O, U, D. L is out, so skip.  

- MISO? – too short.  

- PISO? – not a word.  

- CHOPS – C, H, O, P, S.  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - O is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - I is missing – we need to test I. So skip.  

- CHIPS – C, H, I, P, S.  
  - I is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - New letters C, H, P.  

This seems good: it tests I in position 3, S in position 5, and introduces C, H, P.

- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try common consonants in positions 1 and 2 and see if any valid word pops up:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I G G S – invalid.
- D I G G S – invalid.
- F I G G S – invalid.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe we need to try different consonants:

- B I G S – too short.
- B I S – too short.
- D I S – too short.
- F I S – too short.
- G I S – too short.
- K I S – too short.
- M I S – too short.
- V I S – too short.
- W I S – too short.

Wait, let’s think of 5-letter words ending in “I_S” with S in position 5 and I in position 3:

- B I D G E – E is out.
- B I G S – too short.
- B I V E S – E is out.
- D I V O S – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, so invalid.
- F I V E S – E is out.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to try “U” in position 4:

- B I U S – not a word.
- D I U S – not a word.
- F I U S – not a word.
- G I U S – not a word.
- K I U S – not a word.
- M I U S – not a word.
- V I U S – not a word.
- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try “B” in position 1 and “D” in position 2:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I D S – too short.
- B I D _ S – not working.

How about “F” in position 1 and “I” in position 2 – but I is already in position 3.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? I ? S

Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): B, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, O

Possible words:
- B O I D S – “BOIDS” is a biological term (a type of fish), but it’s uncommon.
- D O I L S – L is out.
- F O I D S – “FOIDS” is not a word.
- G O I D S – not a word.
- K O I S – too short.
- M O I S – not a word.
- V O I D S – “VOIDS” is a valid word!
- W O I D S – not a word.
- B U I L S – L is out.
- D U I L S – L is out.
- F U I L S – L is out.
- G U I L S – L is out.
- K U I L S – L is out.
- M U I L S – L is out.
- V U I L S – L is out.
- W U I L S – L is out.

“VOIDS” seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern _ _ I _ S with allowed letters.

Let’s check:
- V (position 1) – not ruled out.
- O (position 2) – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, but here O is in position 2 – allowed.
- I (position 3) – confirmed ✓.
- D (position 4) – not ruled out.
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓.

This fits perfectly.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ S  
and it must contain O somewhere, but O cannot be in position 2.

Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4.  
But position 3 is already I, and position 5 is S, so O can only be in position 1 or 4.

Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out ones): B, F, G, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z, O, U

Let me try ""K"" in position 1, ""I"" in position 2 – but I is already in position 3, so this would duplicate I, which is allowed but may not form a word.

But we need valid words. Let me try ""K"" in position 1, ""U"" in position 2, ""I"" in position 3, ""O"" in position 4, ""S"" in position 5:

Let me try ""K"" in position 1, ""I"" in position 2 – but I is already in position 3, so this would duplicate I, which is allowed but may not form a word.

But we need valid words. Let me try ""K"" in position 1, ""U"" in position 2, ""I"" in position 3, ""O"" in position 4, ""S"" in position 5:

- K U I O S – this is a valid word!

Let me check:
- K (position 1) – not ruled out.
- U (position 2) – not ruled out.
- I (position 3) – confirmed ✓.
- O (position 4) – allowed, and O is in the word but not in position 2.
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓.

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants
2. Common vowels
3. No repeating letters to test more unique letters

Some excellent starting words are: SLATE, CRANE, STARE, ARISE, or CRISP. Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L, A, T, E are all not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains S but NOT in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain L, A, T, E.
- We still need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess would:
1. Keep the S but move it to a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (L, A, T, E).

Possible good candidates: 
- RISON (R, I, S, O, N) – uses S in position 3, and tests R, I, O, N.
- CRISP – but P is less common, and we already ruled out T and A.
- SNORT – but T is out.
- SORRY – but R is repeated.

RISON seems best: it tests S (moved to position 3), plus common letters R, I, O, N.

Guess 2: RISON -> FEEDBACK: R(x) I(-) S(-) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- Letters L, A, T, E are completely absent.

Round 2: RISON → R(x) I(-) S(-) O(-) N(x)  
- R and N are absent.  
- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- S is in the word but not in position 3.  
- O is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know the word contains: S, I, O.  
Positions ruled out for them:  
- S cannot be 1 or 3.  
- I cannot be 2.  
- O cannot be 4.

Letters completely ruled out: L, A, T, E, R, N.

Remaining common consonants to test: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since we already have I, O, and A, E ruled out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (2, 4, or 5).  
2. Place I and O in new positions.  
3. Introduce new common letters (C, D, G, H, K, M, P, U).  
4. Avoid all ruled-out letters.

Candidate words:  
- DICOS – but C and D are good letters, and it places I, O, S in new spots.  
- SHOCK – but H and C are good, and it uses S in position 1 (ruled out).  
- COSMIC – too long.  
- DICOT – T is out.  
- SHOGI – G and H are good, but O is in position 4 (ruled out).  

DICOS seems best: it uses S (position 3), I (position 2), O (position 5), plus new letters D and C.  
But wait – I cannot be in position 2 (from RISON feedback). So DICOS is invalid.

Next candidate:  
- CLOUD – but U is a vowel we haven't tested, and it introduces C, L (ruled out), O, U, D. L is out, so skip.  

- MISO? – too short.  

- PISO? – not a word.  

- CHOPS – C, H, O, P, S.  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - O is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - I is missing – we need to test I. So skip.  

- CHIPS – C, H, I, P, S.  
  - I is in position 3 (allowed).  
  - S is in position 5 (allowed).  
  - New letters C, H, P.  

This seems good: it tests I in position 3, S in position 5, and introduces C, H, P.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are IN the word and their positions:
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Letters that are IN the word but whose positions are NOT yet fixed:
- None, because I and S are now locked in positions 3 and 5.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, R, N, C, H, P

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ S  
and it must use only letters that have NOT been ruled out.

Remaining common consonants to try: B, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels to try: U (since A, E ruled out, I and O already placed)

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 2, and position 4.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ _ I _ S and use only allowed letters:

- B I D G S – not a valid word.
- B I G G S – “BIGGS” is a proper noun, not allowed.
- D I V O S – “DIVOS” is not a standard word.
- D I M P S – P is ruled out.
- F I V E S – E is ruled out.
- G I V E S – E is ruled out.
- K I V I S – “KIVIS” is not a word.
- M I K I S – “MIKIS” is not standard.
- V I D D S – not a word.
- W I D D S – not a word.
- D I O S – too short.
- B I O S – too short.
- M I O S – not a word.
- G I O S – not a word.
- F I O S – not a word.
- D I U S – “DIUS” is not a word.
- M I U S – not a word.
- G I U S – not a word.
- K I U S – not a word.
- V I U S – not a word.
- B I U S – not a word.
- F I U S – not a word.
- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try common consonants in positions 1 and 2 and see if any valid word pops up:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I G G S – invalid.
- D I G G S – invalid.
- F I G G S – invalid.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Maybe we need to try different consonants:

- B I G S – too short.
- B I S – too short.
- D I S – too short.
- F I S – too short.
- G I S – too short.
- K I S – too short.
- M I S – too short.
- V I S – too short.
- W I S – too short.

Wait, let’s think of 5-letter words ending in “I_S” with S in position 5 and I in position 3:

- B I D G E – E is out.
- B I G S – too short.
- B I V E S – E is out.
- D I V O S – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, so invalid.
- F I V E S – E is out.
- G I V E S – E is out.
- K I V E S – E is out.
- M I V E S – E is out.
- V I D D S – invalid.
- W I D D S – invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe we need to try “U” in position 4:

- B I U S – not a word.
- D I U S – not a word.
- F I U S – not a word.
- G I U S – not a word.
- K I U S – not a word.
- M I U S – not a word.
- V I U S – not a word.
- W I U S – not a word.

Let’s try “B” in position 1 and “D” in position 2:

- B I D G S – invalid.
- B I D S – too short.
- B I D _ S – not working.

How about “F” in position 1 and “I” in position 2 – but I is already in position 3.

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations systematically:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? I ? S

Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): B, D, F, G, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U, O

Possible words:
- B O I D S – “BOIDS” is a biological term (a type of fish), but it’s uncommon.
- D O I L S – L is out.
- F O I D S – “FOIDS” is not a word.
- G O I D S – not a word.
- K O I S – too short.
- M O I S – not a word.
- V O I D S – “VOIDS” is a valid word!
- W O I D S – not a word.
- B U I L S – L is out.
- D U I L S – L is out.
- F U I L S – L is out.
- G U I L S – L is out.
- K U I L S – L is out.
- M U I L S – L is out.
- V U I L S – L is out.
- W U I L S – L is out.

“VOIDS” seems to be the only valid word fitting the pattern _ _ I _ S with allowed letters.

Let’s check:
- V (position 1) – not ruled out.
- O (position 2) – O is in the word but position 4 is ruled out for O, but here O is in position 2 – allowed.
- I (position 3) – confirmed ✓.
- D (position 4) – not ruled out.
- S (position 5) – confirmed ✓.

This fits perfectly.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Positions locked:
   - Position 3: I (✓)
   - Position 5: S (✓)

2. Letters that are IN the word but whose positions are NOT yet fixed:
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from VOIDS feedback: O(-)).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   L, A, T, E, R, N, C, H, P, V, D

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ S  
and it must contain O somewhere, but O cannot be in position 2.

Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 4.  
But position 3 is already I, and position 5 is S, so O can only be in position 1 or 4.

Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out ones): B, F, G, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z, O, U

We need two more letters to fill positions 1, 2, and 4 (since O must be in 1 or 4).

Let’s consider the two cases:

Case 1: O in position 1  
Pattern: O _ I _ S  
We need a letter for position 2 and 4.  
From allowed letters: B, F, G, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z, U  
We need a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- O B I S _ – too short.
- O B I K S – not a word.
- O B I G S – not a word.
- O B I M S – not a word.
- O F I G S – not a word.
- O F I M S – not a word.
- O G I M S – not a word.
- O K I M S – not a word.
- O M I G S – not a word.
- O W I L S – L is out.
- O B I U S – not a word.
- O F I U S – not a word.
- O G I U S – not a word.
- O K I U S – not a word.
- O M I U S – not a word.
- O W I U S – not a word.

Case 2: O in position 4  
Pattern: _ _ I O S  
We need letters for positions 1 and 2.

Possible words:
- B I I O S – invalid (I repeated).
- F I I O S – invalid.
- G I I O S – invalid.
- K I I O S – invalid.
- M I I O S – invalid.
- B I O O S – invalid.
- F I O O S – invalid.
- G I O O S – invalid.
- K I O O S – invalid.
- M I O O S – invalid.
- B I O N S – N is out.
- F I O N S – N is out.
- G I O N S – N is out.
- K I O N S – N is out.
- M I O N S – N is out.
- B I O M S – M is allowed.
- F I O M S – not a word.
- G I O M S – not a word.
- K I O M S – not a word.
- M I O M S – not a word.
- B I O G S – not a word.
- F I O G S – not a word.
- G I O G S – not a word.

- K I O W S – not a word.
- M I O W S – not a word.
- W I O M S – not a word.
- Y I O M S – not a word.
- Z I O M S – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me try different combinations:

- B I G O S – not a word.
- F I G O S – not a word.
- G I F O S – not a word.
- K I F O S – not a word.
- M I F O S – not a word.

- F I Z O S – not a word.
- G I Z O S – not a word.
- K I Z O S – not a word.

From the five rounds we now have:

Positions locked:
- 3: I (✓)
- 5: S (✓)

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- I (position 3)
- S (position 5)
- O (somewhere, but NOT in positions 2 or 4)

Therefore O must be in position 1.

So the pattern is: O _ I _ S

Letters completely ruled out so far: L, A, T, E, R, N, C, H, P, V, D, K, U

Allowed letters left: B, F, G, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters from that set to fill positions 2 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- B and G → OBIGS (not a word)
- B and M → OBIMS (not a word)
- F and G → OFIGS (not a word)
- F and M → OFIMS (not a word)
- G and M → OIGMS (not a word)
- B and F → OBI F S (invalid)
- W and B → OBIW S (invalid)
- Y and B → OBIY S (invalid)
- G and B → OBI G S (invalid)

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words that match O _ I _ S and use only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Valid words:
- O B I S _ – too short
