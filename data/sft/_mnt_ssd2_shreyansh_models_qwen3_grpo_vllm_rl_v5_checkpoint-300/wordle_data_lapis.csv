### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

1. Include A and S in new positions.
2. Introduce other common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid R, O, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N  
Letters definitely IN the word: A, S, I  
Exact positions so far:
- I is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in the word but NOT positions 1 or 3.
- S is in the word but NOT positions 1 or 4.

We still need to place A and S in the remaining slots (positions 2 and 5) and fill the last slot with an unused common consonant.

Good untested consonants left: L, C, D, G, B, M, P, H, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps I in slot 4,
- puts A in slot 2 or 5,
- puts S in the remaining open slot,
- adds one fresh consonant.

A simple candidate is “CASSI” but that repeats S.  
Another candidate is “PLAIS” but A is already ruled out of slot 3.  
A valid arrangement: “C” + “A” + “S” + “I” + “S” again repeats S.  
Try “BASIC”:
- B (new letter),
- A (slot 2),
- S (slot 3),
- I (slot 4),
- C (new letter).

This satisfies all constraints so far.

Constraints:

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining pool, ensuring no repeats.

Good untested consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English

This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E.
- Letters definitely in the word (but positions unknown): A, S.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good next guess should:
1. Include A and S in new positions.
2. Introduce other common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid R, O, E.

Possible candidates: STAIN, SLANT, SAINT, STAND, etc.

""STAIN"" looks good because:
- S moves to position 1 (was position 4).
- A moves to position 2 (was position 1).
- Tests new letters T, I, N.
- Avoids R, O, E.

We still need to place A and S in the remaining slots (positions 2 and 5) and fill the last slot with an unused common consonant.

Let’s try a word that:
- keeps I in slot 4,
- puts A in slot 2 or 5,
- puts S in the remaining open slot,
- adds one fresh consonant.

A simple candidate is “CASSI” but that repeats S.  
Another candidate is “PLAIS” but A is already ruled out of slot 3.  
A valid arrangement: “C” + “A” + “S” + “I” + “S” again repeats S.  
Try “BASIC”:
- B (new letter),
- A (slot 2),
- S (slot 3),
- I (slot 4),
- C (new letter).

This satisfies all constraints so far.

We now have four pieces of feedback.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): R, O, E, T, N, B, C, H, D  
Letters definitely IN the word (✓): A, I, S  
Fixed positions from the latest feedback:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ A _ I S

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3: any consonants not yet ruled out (F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and A, I, S (but A, I, S are already placed).

We need two distinct consonants for positions 1 and 3. Common remaining consonants: F, G, L, M, P, V, W.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching _ A _ I S:

- F A K I S  → “FAKIS” – but “FAKIS” isn’t a valid English word.
- F A V I S  → “FAVIS” – not valid.
- L A G I S  → “LAGIS” – not valid.
- L A M I S  → “LAMIS” – not valid.
- M A G I S  → “MAGIS” – valid (short for magister or a type of degree).
- P A G I S  → “PAGIS” – not valid.
- V A L I S  → “VALIS” – valid (plural of valishea, though rare).
- W A L I S  → “WALIS” – valid (plural of walishee, also rare).

The most common English word fitting the pattern is “MAGIS”.

Let’s verify:
- M (new), A (pos 2 ✓), G (new), I (pos 4 ✓), S (pos 5 ✓).
- All letters are allowed and no repeats of excluded letters.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Another candidate is “PLAIS” but A is already ruled out of slot 3.  
A valid arrangement: “C” + “A” + “S” + “I” + “S” again repeats S.  
Try “BASIC”:
- B (new letter),
- A (slot 2),
- S (slot 3),
- I (slot 4),
- C (new letter).

This satisfies all constraints so far.

Current knowledge:

Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, B, C  
Letters definitely IN the word: A, S, I  
Exact positions known:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)

Remaining letters to determine: positions 1, 3, 5  
Letters still allowed: A, S, I plus any unused consonants (D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Constraints:
- S must be in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from earlier feedback).  
  Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
  But position 2 is already A, so S must be in position 5.

Thus:
- Position 5 = S

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining pool, ensuring no repeats.

Good untested consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- has A in position 2,
- has I in position 4,
- has S in position 5,
- uses two new consonants for positions 1 and 3.

Candidate: “HADIS”  
Check constraints:
- H (new), A (pos 2 ✓), D (new), I (pos 4 ✓), S (pos 5).  
All constraints satisfied and no repeats of excluded letters.

Another candidate: “LADIS” – same pattern.  
But “HADIS” uses H which is slightly more common.

Let’s go with “HADIS”.

We now have four pieces of feedback.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): R, O, E, T, N, B, C, H, D  
Letters definitely IN the word (✓): A, I, S  
Fixed positions from the latest feedback:
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is: _ A _ I S

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3: any consonants not yet ruled out (F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and A, I, S (but A, I, S are already placed).

We need two distinct consonants for positions 1 and 3. Common remaining consonants: F, G, L, M, P, V, W.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching _ A _ I S:

- F A K I S  → “FAKIS” – but “FAKIS” isn’t a valid English word.
- F A V I S  → “FAVIS” – not valid.
- L A G I S  → “LAGIS” – not valid.
- L A M I S  → “LAMIS” – not valid.
- M A G I S  → “MAGIS” – valid (short for magister or a type of degree).
- P A G I S  → “PAGIS” – not valid.
- V A L I S  → “VALIS” – valid (plural of valishea, though rare).
- W A L I S  → “WALIS” – valid (plural of walishee, also rare).

The most common English word fitting the pattern is “MAGIS”.

Let’s verify:
- M (new), A (pos 2 ✓), G (new), I (pos 4 ✓), S (pos 5 ✓).
- All letters are allowed and no repeats of excluded letters.

Therefore, “MAGIS” is the logical next guess.
