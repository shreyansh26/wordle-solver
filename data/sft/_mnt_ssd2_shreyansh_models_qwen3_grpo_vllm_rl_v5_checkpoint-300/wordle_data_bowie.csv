### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

- ""TOWER"" – has R (invalid)
- ""CLOVE"" – has O in position 2 and ends with E, no A/R/S

Actually, we need O in position 2. So:

- O could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Possible words: OCEAN (but has A), TONER (has R), LONER (has R), etc.

Looking for valid words:
- ""TOWER"" – has R (invalid)
- ""CLOVE"" – has O in position 2 and ends with E, no A/R/S
- ""CLOVE"" seems valid: C L O V E
- ""DOPEY"" – ends with Y, not E
- ""PHONE"" – has P, H, O, N, E – no A/R/S, O is in position 3 (invalid)
- ""VOICE"" – has O in position 2 and ends with E, no A/R/S
- ""VOICE"" is a good candidate.

Let me verify:
- V: valid letter
- O: in word, position 2 (not 3)
- I: valid letter
- C: valid letter
- E: correct position 5
No A, R, or S present. This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - A, R, S are excluded.

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(-) C(x) E(✓)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - V and C are excluded.
   - E is still fixed in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Must contain I (but not in position 3).
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, S, V, C).
- I must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible placements of I:
- Position 1: I O _ _ E
- Position 3: _ O I _ E
- Position 4: _ O _ I E

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

- I O _ _ E: ""IONIC"" (has C), ""ION"" too short, ""IOUE"" invalid.
- _ O I _ E: ""FOILE"" (obsolete), ""MOIST"" (has S), ""NOISE"" (has S), ""POISE"" (has S), ""DOING"" (ends G), ""TOILE"" (has T, but T is allowed).
- _ O _ I E: ""PHONE"" (has P, H, O, N, E – but O is in position 2, so P H O N E doesn’t fit because O is in position 3 here). Wait, ""PHONE"" has O in position 3 – invalid. Need O in position 2.

Actually, we need O in position 2. So:
- _ O _ _ E with I somewhere.

Let me list candidates:
- ""DOING"" – ends G, not E.
- ""TONER"" – has R.
- ""POISE"" – has S.
- ""MOIST"" – has S.
- ""NOISE"" – has S.
- ""BOGIE"" – has B, O, G, I, E – O in position 2, I in position 4, no excluded letters.
- ""BOGIE"" seems valid: B O G I E.

Check constraints:
- B, O, G, I, E – no A, R, S, V, C.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- I is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- E is in position 5 (✓).

""BOGIE"" is a valid English word meaning a railway car or a place name.

Another candidate: ""FOGIE"" (F O G I E) – same pattern, valid.

Between ""BOGIE"" and ""FOGIE"", both fit. I’ll choose ""BOGIE"".

From the new feedback on BOGIE:

- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is now:
B O _ I E

We only need to determine the third letter.  
Allowed letters (excluding A, R, S, V, C, G):
D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

Common consonants left: D, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T

Possible 5-letter words matching B O _ I E:
- B O D I E → “BODIE” (valid, though rare)
- B O F I E → “BOFIE” (not a word)
- B O H I E → “BOHIE” (not a word)
- B O K I E → “BOKIE” (not a word)
- B O L I E → “BOLIE” (not standard)
- B O M I E → “BOMIE” (valid; British for “person”)
- B O N I E → “BONIE” (variant spelling of Bonnie, sometimes accepted)
- B O P I E → “BOPIE” (not a word)
- B O T I E → “BOTIE” (valid; variant of botany term)

The safest, most common choice is “BOTIE” (used in some South African English contexts). However, a more universally recognized word fitting the pattern is “BONIE” (though it’s a name). 

Looking again, the clearest valid word is “BODIE” (a surname and Scots term for a “broad hill”). But the most straightforward valid word is actually “BOTIE” (used in “botie” fish). 

However, the most common and unambiguous valid word in English that fits B O _ I E is:

B O T I E → “BOTIE” (valid, though uncommon)
But let’s double-check: is there a more common word? 

Another candidate: “BONIE” (as in Bonnie & Clyde) – but it’s a proper noun. 

The best valid common word is “BOTIE”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O somewhere other than the third position.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains O (but not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.

Let me brainstorm possibilities:
- O could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Possible words: OCEAN (but has A), TONER (has R), LONER (has R), etc.

Current confirmed pattern:
B O _ I E

We know:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: unknown (but must be a letter not yet excluded)
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: E

Letters already excluded: A, R, S, V, C, G, T

So the third letter must come from: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common 5-letter English words that fit B O _ I E:
- B O D I E → ""BODIE"" (valid, but uncommon)
- B O K I E → ""BOKIE"" (not a word)
- B O L I E → ""BOLIE"" (not standard)
- B O M I E → ""BOMIE"" (valid, British for person)
- B O N I E → ""BONIE"" (valid, informal)
- B O P I E → ""BOPIE"" (not a word)
- B O W I E → ""BOWIE"" (valid, surname/brand)
- B O X I E → ""BOXIE"" (valid, diminutive of box)

Among these, ""BOWIE"" and ""BOXIE"" are the most common. ""BOWIE"" is a well-known surname and brand, while ""BOXIE"" is a diminutive. Both are valid, but ""BOWIE"" is slightly more recognized.

Therefore, the best next guess is ""BOWIE"".
