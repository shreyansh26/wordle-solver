### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in 5-letter words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained from the feedback

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

- It has O in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids A, R, S, E.
- It includes P, I, N, T – all common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

From the feedback so far:

Known facts
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, C, H
- Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:
  – N is in position 1
  – O is in position 2
  – T is in position 3

So the secret word has the fixed pattern:
N O T _ _

Remaining letters to determine: positions 4 and 5.

Constraints for positions 4 and 5
- Cannot use any of the already excluded letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, C, H.
- Must be valid 5-letter English words starting with NOT.

Common remaining consonants and vowels that fit:
Allowed pool: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels U (only vowel left).

We need two more letters from that pool to form a valid word.

Candidate endings
- NOTED → ends with E (excluded) → invalid
- NOTCH → already tried, ends with CH (both excluded)
- NOTAL → ends with AL (A excluded)
- NOTUM → ends with UM (letters allowed)
- NOTIF → ends with IF (I excluded)
- NOTGO → ends with GO (letters allowed)
- NOTED → ends with ED (E excluded)
- NOTAB → ends with AB (A excluded)
- NOTED → ends with ED (E excluded)
- NOTED → ends with ED (E excluded)

Valid candidates from above:
- NOTUM (ends with UM)
- NOTGO (ends with GO)

Between these, NOTUM is a valid English word meaning “a short burst of activity,” and it uses only allowed letters (U, M). Let’s choose NOTUM.
