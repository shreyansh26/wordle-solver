For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test as many as possible. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O
- Does NOT contain R, S, E
- A is not in position 1
- O is not in position 3

Letters left to test: T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.
I need a word that:
1. Uses A and O in new positions
2. Introduces new common consonants
3. Avoids R, S, E

A good candidate is ""ALOUD"":
- Uses A (position 2), O (position 3), and new letters L, U, D
- However, O is in position 3, which was already ruled out (- for O in position 3)

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"":
- A in position 1 (but A cannot be in position 1, ruled out by A(-))
- So A must be in positions 2-5

Candidate: ""ADOPT"":
- A (position 1, but A cannot be in position 1) → invalid

Candidate: ""PLAID"":
- A in position 3, O not present → but we know O is in the word, so invalid

Candidate: ""COBRA"":
- R is excluded → invalid

Candidate: ""ADOPT"" again invalid for A in position 1

Better candidate: ""PAINT"":
- A in position 2, O not present → but O must be somewhere

Wait, let's try ""PLANT"":
- A in position 2, O not present → but O must be in word

We must include A and O, and avoid R/S/E.

Let's try ""ADION"" (but not a valid word)

Valid word: ""ADION"" no, ""PLAID"" no O

Wait, ""PLAID"" has A and O? No, ""PLAID"" has A and I, D.

Valid word with A and O: ""ALOUD"" but O in position 3 is invalid.

Next: ""OCEAN"" but E is excluded.

Valid word: ""ACORN"" but R is excluded.

Valid word: ""COAST"" but S is excluded.

Valid word: ""ABOUT"" but A in position 1 is invalid.

Valid word: ""ACORN"" invalid R.

Valid word: ""PLAID"" no O.

- C, U, L, D are new letters
- No R, S, E
- A is missing → but we know A is in word, so invalid

Valid word: ""ALOUD"" is best but O position 3 invalid.

Next: ""ACORN"" invalid R.

Valid word: ""COBIA"" (A, O, but rare)

Valid word: ""COBIA"" has C, O, B, I, A:
- A in position 5
- O in position 2
- No R, S, E
- A not in position 1 (OK, it's in 5)
- O not in position 3 (OK, it's in 2)

This seems valid.

But ""COBIA"" is a type of fish, might be obscure.

Better: ""COBRA"" invalid R.

Valid word: ""COBIA"" seems acceptable.

But let's try ""ALOUD"" with O in position 3 invalid.

Alternative: ""PAINT"" no O.

Valid word: ""PLAID"" no O.

Valid word: ""COULD"" no A.

Valid word: ""ACORN"" invalid R.

Valid word: ""COBIA"" has A and O in new positions.

Thus, ""COBIA"" is a reasonable next guess.

Based on the feedback that A and O are in the word but not in their original positions (1 and 3 respectively), and that R, S, E are not in the word, I'll try a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

From the new feedback on COBIA:
- C(✓)  → C is correct in position 1
- O(✓)  → O is correct in position 2
- B(-)  → B is in the word but not in position 3
- I(x)  → I is not in the word
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word now looks like:
C  O  _  _  _
with additional constraints:
- A must appear somewhere in positions 3-4-5 (but not 1,2,5)
- B must appear somewhere (but not in position 3)
- No R, S, E, I
- No letters already ruled out: R, S, E, I

Letters left to use: A, B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place A and B in the remaining three positions (3,4,5) with A not in 5.

Possible arrangements:
- Position 3: A or B
- Position 4: A or B or other
- Position 5: A or B

But A must be in 3,4 or 5 (but not 5 according to A(-) in guess 1, but that was position 5 in AROSE, and in COBIA it's position 5 with A(-), so A cannot be in 5. So A must be in 3 or 4.

B must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be in 3).

So possible combinations:
1. A in 3, B in 4 or 5
2. A in 4, B in 5

Let's try:
- C O A B _
- C O A _ B
- C O _ A B
- C O B A _

But B cannot be in 3, so C O _ A B is invalid (B in 5 is OK).

Valid options:
- C O A B _ → need 5th letter, but we have only letters left: A,B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. A and B are used, C and O are fixed. So 5th letter must be new.
- C O A _ B → same issue
- C O _ A B → same issue
- C O B _ A → but A must not be in 5 (from COBIA feedback), so this is invalid (A in 5)

Wait, in COBIA, A was in position 5 with feedback (-), so A cannot be in 5. So C O B _ A is invalid.

Alternative: C O _ B A → but A in 5 is invalid.

Thus, possible valid patterns:
1. C O A B X (X new letter)
2. C O A X B (X new letter)
3. C O X A B (X new letter)
4. C O B A X (A in 4 is OK, B in 2 is OK, but O is in 2, so B in 3 is invalid)
Wait, positions:
1: C
2: O
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

So:
- C O A B X → positions 3:A, 4:B, 5:X → but B cannot be in 4 (no restriction), but we have no info on B position except not 3.
- C O A X B → positions 3:A, 4:X, 5:B → OK
- C O X A B → positions 3:X, 4:A, 5:B → OK
- C O B X A → positions 3:B, but B cannot be in 3 (from COBIA feedback B(-)), so invalid.

Thus, valid patterns are:
- C O A B _
- C O A _ B
- C O _ A B

Now, we need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns, using only allowed letters (no R,S,E,I).

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with CO, with A and B in remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- COBRA → has R (invalid)
- COBIA → already tried
- COBALT → too long
- COBRA → invalid
- COAST → has S (invalid)
- COBIA → already tried
- COBALT → too long
- COBRA → invalid
- COBIA → already tried
- COBRA → invalid

Looking at the patterns:
- C O A B _ → COAB_ → no common word
- C O A _ B → COA_B → COAB is not a word
- C O _ A B → CO_A_B → possible words: COBAB (no), COGAB (no), COMAB (no), COPAB (no), COVAB (no), COLAB (no), COGAB (no), COXAB (no)

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word is C O A B X, but no common word.

Alternatively, maybe C O A _ B → COA_B → COADB (no), COABD (no), COACB (no), COAEB (invalid E), COAFB (no), COAGB (no), COAHB (no), COAIB (invalid I), COAKB (no), COALB (no), COAMB (no), COANB (no), COAPB (no), COAQB (no), COARB (invalid R), COASB (invalid S), COATB (no), COAUB (no), COAVB (no), COAWB (no), COAXB (no), COAYB (no), COAZB (no)

None seem valid.

Next pattern: C O _ A B → CO_A_B
Possible words:
- COMAB (no)
- COGAB (no)
- COBAN (but N is allowed)
- COBAS (invalid S)
- COBAT (no)
- COBEL (no)
- COBEM (no)
- COBET (no)
- COBEZ (no)
- COBIA (already tried)
- COBOL (no)
- COBOT (no)
- COBRA (invalid R)
- COBUT (no)
- COBZA (no)

Hmm, none obvious.

Wait, let's think of C O A B X → COABX → need a valid word.

Looking up, ""COBAX"" is not a common word.

""COBIA"" already tried.

""COBRA"" invalid.

""COAST"" invalid S.

""COBET"" no.

""COBAN"" is a word (type of tree), but is it common? Maybe.

But let's think of other possibilities.

Alternative: Maybe the word is C O A B X with X being a letter we haven't used yet.

But no common word.

Alternative: Maybe the word is C O B A X → but A in 4 is OK, B in 3 is invalid (from COBIA feedback B(-)).

Thus, only possible pattern seems C O A _ B → COA_B

Looking for valid words: ""COADB"" no, ""COABD"" no...

Wait, ""COBIA"" is already tried.

""COBRA"" invalid.

""COAST"" invalid S.

""COBET"" no.

""COBAN"" is a word (tree), but is it valid in Wordle? Possibly.

Alternatively, ""COBIA"" already tried.

""COBRA"" invalid.

""COBET"" no.

""COBAN"" seems the closest, but let's check:

""COBAN"" - letters C,O,B,A,N
- C in 1 ✓
- O in 2 ✓
- B in 3 → but from COBIA feedback B(-) means B is in word but not in position 3 → so B cannot be in 3 → thus COBAN is invalid.

Thus, no valid words fitting patterns?

Wait, let's re-examine patterns:

Actually, from COBIA feedback:
- C(✓) O(✓) _ _ _
- B is in word but not in position 3
- A is in word but not in position 5
- So A must be in 3 or 4
- B must be in 4 or 5 (cannot be in 3)

Thus possible patterns:
1. C O A B _ (A in 3, B in 4)
2. C O A _ B (A in 3, B in 5)
3. C O _ A B (A in 4, B in 5)

Now, looking for words:

1. C O A B _ → COAB_ → ""COAB"" is not a word
2. C O A _ B → COA_B → ""COADB"" no, ""COABD"" no, ""COACB"" no, ""COAEB"" invalid E, ""COAFB"" no, ""COAGB"" no, ""COAHB"" no, ""COAIB"" invalid I, ""COAKB"" no, ""COALB"" no, ""COAMB"" no, ""COANB"" no, ""COAPB"" no, ""COAQB"" no, ""COARB"" invalid R, ""COASB"" invalid S, ""COATB"" no, ""COAUB"" no, ""COAVB"" no, ""COAWB"" no, ""COAXB"" no, ""COAYB"" no, ""COAZB"" no
3. C O _ A B → CO_A_B → ""COMAB"" no, ""COGAB"" no, ""COBAN"" but B in 3 invalid, ""COBEL"" no, ""COBEM"" no, ""COBET"" no, ""COBEZ"" no, ""COBIA"" already tried, ""COBOL"" no, ""COBOT"" no, ""COBRA"" invalid R, ""COBUT"" no, ""COBZA"" no, ""COGAB"" no, ""COHAB"" no, ""COJAB"" no, ""COLAB"" no, ""COMAB"" no, ""CONAB"" no, ""COOAB"" no, ""COQAB"" no, ""COTAB"" no, ""COVAB"" no, ""COXAB"" no, ""COYAB"" no, ""COZAB"" no

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think of ""COBIA"" already tried, but maybe the word is ""COBIA"" with different positions? No, already tried.

Alternative: Maybe the word is ""COBRA"" but invalid R.

""COAST"" invalid S.

""COBET"" no.

""COBAN"" but B in 3 invalid.

""COGAB"" no.

""COHAB"" is a word (as in ""cohabitate""), but is it valid? Let's check:

""COHAB"" - letters C,O,H,A,B
- C in 1 ✓
- O in 2 ✓
- H new
- A in 4 (OK, not 5)
- B in 5 (OK, not 3)
- No R,S,E,I
This fits all constraints!

Thus, ""COHAB"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- C O H A B
- C(✓) O(✓) H(?) A(?) B(?)
From feedback:
- C and O are correct in positions 1 and 2
- A is in word but not in position 5 (here in 4) ✓
- B is in word but not in position 3 (here in 5) ✓
- H is new letter to test
- No R,S,E,I

Thus, ""COHAB"" is a valid next guess.

Based on the updated constraints:
- C is fixed in position 1
- O is fixed in position 2
- A must appear in positions 3, 4 (not 5)
- B must appear in positions 4, 5 (not 3)
- No R, S, E, I

The word ""COHAB"" fits perfectly:
