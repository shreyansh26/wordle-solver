### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter positioning to test multiple positions

This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are present and their possible positions in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- DOES contain A, but not in position 1.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (and places it somewhere other than position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be ""ADMIT"":
- Uses A in position 2 (different from position 1).
- Uses new consonants D, M, T.
- Uses new vowel I.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, I, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A (but A is never in the first position)

So the secret word:
- Contains A exactly once.
- Does NOT contain any of R, O, S, E, D, M, I, T.
- May contain any of the remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A).

We still need to test several common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we haven’t tested yet is U, and common consonants left include N, L, C, H, K, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

A strong candidate is “PLANK”:
- Uses A in position 3 (new position).
- Introduces P, L, N, K (all new letters).
- Avoids every eliminated letter.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

Current knowledge:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters and different vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- Good letter positioning to test multiple positions

This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are present and their possible positions in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- DOES contain A, but not in position 1.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses A (and places it somewhere other than position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters not yet tested.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be ""ADMIT"":
- Uses A in position 2 (different from position 1).
- Uses new consonants D, M, T.
- Uses new vowel I.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.

Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) M(x) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, D, M, I, T  
Letters that ARE in the word: A (but A is never in the first position)

So the secret word:
- Contains A exactly once.
- Does NOT contain any of R, O, S, E, D, M, I, T.
- May contain any of the remaining letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A).

We still need to test several common consonants and vowels. The only vowel we haven’t tested yet is U, and common consonants left include N, L, C, H, K, etc.

A good third guess should:
1. Place A in a new position (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce as many new, high-frequency letters as possible.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters.

A strong candidate is “PLANK”:
- Uses A in position 3 (new position).
- Introduces P, L, N, K (all new letters).
- Avoids every eliminated letter.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.
