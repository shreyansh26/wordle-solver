### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters in English. The best starting words typically use common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""RAISE"", etc. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters and covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 consonants (S, L, T). This seems like an excellent first guess to gather information about the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
1. The word starts with S.
2. It contains both A and T, but A is not in the 3rd position and T is not in the 4th position.
3. It does not contain L or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A and T, without L or E, and with A not in position 3 and T not in position 4.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for T: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 1 is already S, so 2, 3, 5)

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 and T in position 3:  
S A T _ _

But we need a 5-letter word, so let’s think of valid words. ""SATIN"" comes to mind, but it has an I and N. Let me check:

- S A T I N: positions 1-5.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not position 3).
- T is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 4).
- No L or E.
- Valid word.

Another option could be ""STAMP"", but P is less common, and we might prefer to test more common letters. ""SATIN"" seems good.

But let me think of another word that might give more information. ""SATCH"" is possible, but C and H are less common. ""SATYR"" has Y, which is uncommon. 

""SAINT"" is another option:
- S A I N T
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 5 (allowed).
- No L or E.
- Common letters I, N.

Between ""SATIN"" and ""SAINT"", ""SAINT"" uses more common letters (I, N) and might give better information. Let’s go with ""SAINT"".

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

2. It contains A, T, and I (all marked “-” so they are in the word but in wrong positions).
3. It does NOT contain L, E, N (from the “x” marks).
4. Position constraints so far:
   - A is not in position 2 (from SAINT) and not in position 3 (from SLATE) ⇒ A must be in 1, 4, or 5. But 1 is already S, so A must be in 4 or 5.
   - T is not in position 4 (from SLATE) and not in position 5 (from SAINT) ⇒ T must be in 2 or 3.
   - I is not in position 3 (from SAINT) ⇒ I must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A, T, I in the remaining positions (A in 4 or 5, T in 2 or 3, I in 2,4,5).
- Uses only letters not excluded (no L, E, N).

Let’s try to place the letters:
- If T is in position 2, then I must be in 4 or 5 and A must be in 4 or 5. But 4 and 5 can only hold one of them, so this is impossible (we’d need two letters in one spot).
- Therefore T must be in position 3.
- Then positions 2, 4, 5 must contain A and I, with A in 4 or 5 and I in 2,4,5.
