For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels in the word
- Two common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words
This gives us good coverage of common letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(✓): R is in the word and in position 2
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is not in the word at all
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters present: A, O, R, E
- Letters absent: S

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has E in position 5
3. Contains A and O somewhere (but not in their previous positions)
4. Does not contain S

Possible positions for A and O: positions 1, 3, 4 (but not 1 for A, 3 for O)
Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ E with these constraints.

Good candidates:
- BREAD: B R E A D - but this has E in position 3, not 5
- GRADE: G R A D E - E is in position 5, A is in position 3 (allowed), O is missing
- PROBE: P R O B E - O in position 3 (but feedback says O is not in position 3), so invalid
- CRORE: C R O R E - O in position 3 (invalid), and E is in position 5
- BROKE: B R O K E - O in position 3 (invalid)
- GRAPE: G R A P E - A in position 3, E in position 5, no O - missing O
- FRAME: F R A M E - same issue, no O
- TREAD: T R E A D - E in position 3, not 5
- CREPE: C R E P E - E in position 3, not 5

Wait, I need E in position 5. Let me rethink:
Words ending in E with R in position 2:
- B R E A D - no
- C R E E K - no
- D R E A M - no
- F R E E D - no
- G R E A T - no
- P R E E N - no
- T R E K S - S is out
- W R E C K - no

Actually, looking at the pattern _ R _ _ E, and needing A and O somewhere:
Possible words:
- BROKE: B R O K E - O in position 3 (invalid)
- CRORE: C R O R E - O in position 3 (invalid)
- PROBE: P R O B E - O in position 3 (invalid)
- GROVE: G R O V E - O in position 3 (invalid)
- AROSE: already tried
- BARGE: B A R G E - A in position 2 (invalid), R should be position 2
- CARET: C A R E T - E in position 4, not 5
- RAPHE: R A P H E - R in position 1, should be position 2

Hmm, maybe I need to try words with A and O in positions 1 and 4:
- A R O _ E - but R must be position 2
- _ R A O E - possible
- _ R O A E - possible

Valid words:
- B R A I E - but I is not confirmed
- C R A W E - no
- D R A B E - no
- F R A N E - no
- G R A N E - no
- P R A C E - no
- T R A C E - no
- W R A C E - no

Alternatively, A in position 4 and O in position 1:
- O R _ A E - but R must be position 2
- _ R O A E - possible
Valid words:
- B R O A E - not valid
- C R O A E - not valid
- D R O A E - not valid
- F R O A E - not valid
- P R O A E - not valid

This is tricky. Maybe the word is ""GRAPE"" but it lacks O. Let me think differently - maybe the word is ""BROKE"" but O is in position 3 which was marked invalid. 

Wait, looking back at the feedback:
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is R, position 5 is E, so O must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1, so A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 2 is R, position 5 is E, so A must be in 3 or 4.

So possible positions:
- O in 1 or 4
- A in 3 or 4
- R in 2
- E in 5

Possible combinations:
1. O in 1, A in 3: O R A _ E
   - ORAGE - valid word
2. O in 1, A in 4: O R _ A E
   - ORDAE - not valid
3. O in 4, A in 3: _ R A O E
   - BRAOE - not valid
4. O in 4, A in 3: _ R A O E - same issue

The only valid word fitting seems to be ""ORAGE"" - but this has O in position 1 and A in position 3, which fits the constraints.

But ""ORAGE"" is a valid word (though rare). Maybe a better choice is ""GRAPE"" but it lacks O. 

Alternatively, ""CRAVE"" - but no O. 

Wait, let me think of ""PROBE"" - but O is in position 3 which was marked invalid. 

Actually, looking at the constraints more carefully:
- Word must be _ R _ _ E
- Must contain A and O
- A not in position 1 (so 3 or 4)
- O not in position 3 (so 1, 2, 4, or 5). But position 2 is R, 5 is E, so O must be in 1 or 4.
- No S

Possible valid words:
- O R A _ E: ORAGE
- _ R A O E: BRAVE (but E is in 5, but BRAVE is B R A V E - this has V, but fits _ R A _ E)
Wait, BRAVE is B R A V E - this has:
- R in 2 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1 in AROSE and marked -, so 3 is allowed)
- O is missing - but we know O is in the word from feedback. So BRAVE is invalid.

Next option: ""CRAZE"" - C R A Z E
- R in 2, E in 5
- A in 3
- O is missing - invalid

""CRAPE"" - C R A P E - same issue, no O.

""GRAPE"" - G R A P E - no O.

""PROBE"" - P R O B E - O in 3 (invalid)

""FROND"" - but ends in D, not E.

""DRONE"" - D R O N E
- R in 2 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- O in 3 (invalid)
- A is missing (invalid)

""BROKE"" - B R O K E - O in 3 (invalid)

""CRORE"" - C R O R E - O in 3 (invalid)

""AROSE"" - already tried

""BRAVE"" - no O

This seems impossible - but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of words with R in 2 and E in 5, containing A and O, and no S.

After reconsideration, the only possible word seems to be ""ORANGE"" but it's 6 letters. 

Wait, ""GRAPE"" lacks O, ""CRAVE"" lacks O, ""PROBE"" has O but in invalid position. 

Realizing that with R in 2 and E in 5, and needing both A and O, the only possible arrangement is:
- O in 1, A in 3: O R A _ E - ORAGE
- O in 4, A in 3: _ R A O E - but no valid word

""ORAGE"" is valid though uncommon. 

Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" is invalid due to missing O. 

Thus, the best next guess is ""ORANGE"" but it's 6 letters. Realizing this, perhaps ""CRAVE"" is the closest but still lacks O. 

Re-evaluating, the constraints are tight. The most plausible word seems to be ""ORANGE"" but since it's 6 letters, I must have made an error. 

Upon re-examining, the correct word must be ""ORANGE"" but adjusted to 5 letters - realizing I must have missed ""ORATE"" - O R A T E
- O in 1 (allowed)
- R in 2 (✓)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- T is new
- E in 5 (✓)
This fits all constraints: contains A and O, R in 2, E in 5, no S, and A not in 1, O not in 3.

Thus, ""ORATE"" is a valid next guess.

Based on the feedback:
- R is confirmed in position 2
- E is confirmed in position 5
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (so 3 or 4)
