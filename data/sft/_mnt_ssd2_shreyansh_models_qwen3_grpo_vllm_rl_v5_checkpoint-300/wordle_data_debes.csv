### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, the word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word that should give good information regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's think of words that fit:
- E and S must appear, so let's try to place E in position 1 or 2 and S in position 1-3 or 5.
- Example words: ""STEIN"" (but has A, R, O?), no, ""STEIN"" has I and N - but we don't have constraints on I or N yet.
Wait, ""STEIN"" has E in position 2 and S in position 1 - that's allowed since original positions were 4 and 5 for S and E.

But let's check if ""STEIN"" is valid - yes, it's a 5-letter word.

Another option: ""SEPT"" - but that's 4 letters, needs to be 5.
""SEWED"" - has D and W, but let's see: S in 1, E in 2 - allowed. But we have no info on D or W yet.

""STEEP"" - has two E's, but S is in 1, E's in 2 and 3 - allowed.
But ""STEEP"" uses P which we haven't tested yet.

""SHINE"" - has H, I, N - but S is in 1, E in 5 - but original E was in 5 (x), so E can't be in 5. So ""SHINE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""SPIKE"" - S in 1, P, I, K, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5. So invalid.

""SLICE"" - S in 1, L, I, C, E in 5 - again E in 5 is invalid.

""STEAK"" - E in 2, S in 1 - valid so far. But has A which we know is not in word. So invalid.

""STEIN"" seems valid - S in 1, E in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5. No A, R, or O. And S is not in 4, E is not in 5.

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and E must be in position 1, 2, or 4, with no overlap (since each letter appears once).

Possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then E must be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 3: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- If S is in position 5: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (excluding A,R,O,T,I,N): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- Contains S and E exactly once each.
- S not in 1 or 4.
- E not in 3 or 5.
- Uses only the available letters.

Try S in position 2 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _

Try S in position 3 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E D S _ _ → “EDS” + ? “EDSON” has O (invalid). “EDS” + “T” → “EDST” (invalid). Not working.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E S _ _
Possible word: D E S _ _ → “DESKS” (has K, S is in 3). Check constraints:
- S in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), K is new, D is new. No forbidden letters.
“DESKS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: D, E, S, K — all allowed.
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3) — OK.
- E not in 3 or 5 (it’s in 2) — OK.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, the word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word that should give good information regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's think of words that fit:
- E and S must appear, so let's try to place E in position 1 or 2 and S in position 1-3 or 5.
- Example words: ""STEIN"" (but has A, R, O?), no, ""STEIN"" has I and N - but we don't have constraints on I or N yet.
Wait, ""STEIN"" has E in position 2 and S in position 1 - that's allowed since original positions were 4 and 5 for S and E.

But let's check if ""STEIN"" is valid - yes, it's a 5-letter word.

Another option: ""SEPT"" - but that's 4 letters, needs to be 5.
""SEWED"" - has D and W, but let's see: S in 1, E in 2 - allowed. But we have no info on D or W yet.

""STEEP"" - has two E's, but S is in 1, E's in 2 and 3 - allowed.
But ""STEEP"" uses P which we haven't tested yet.

""SHINE"" - has H, I, N - but S is in 1, E in 5 - but original E was in 5 (x), so E can't be in 5. So ""SHINE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""SPIKE"" - S in 1, P, I, K, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5. So invalid.

""SLICE"" - S in 1, L, I, C, E in 5 - again E in 5 is invalid.

""STEAK"" - E in 2, S in 1 - valid so far. But has A which we know is not in word. So invalid.

""STEIN"" seems valid - S in 1, E in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5. No A, R, or O. And S is not in 4, E is not in 5.

Let's go with ""STEIN"".

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and E must be in position 1, 2, or 4, with no overlap (since each letter appears once).

Possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then E must be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 3: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- If S is in position 5: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (excluding A,R,O,T,I,N): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- Contains S and E exactly once each.
- S not in 1 or 4.
- E not in 3 or 5.
- Uses only the available letters.

Try S in position 2 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E S _ _ _ → “ESPY” is 4 letters; “ESSEX” has X and repeats S. Not valid.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E D S _ _ → “EDS” + ? “EDSON” has O (invalid). “EDS” + “T” → “EDST” (invalid). Not working.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E S _ _
Possible word: D E S _ _ → “DESKS” (has K, S is in 3). Check constraints:
- S in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), K is new, D is new. No forbidden letters.
“DESKS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: D, E, S, K — all allowed.
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3) — OK.
- E not in 3 or 5 (it’s in 2) — OK.
- No A, R, O, T, I, N — OK.

Therefore, “DESKS” is a good next guess.

Let's parse the latest feedback carefully:

DESKS → D(✓) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)

1. D is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 2.
3. The first S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be elsewhere).
4. K is not in the word.
5. The second S is correct in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: D E _ _ S
- It contains exactly one S (since the first S was marked ""-"" and the second ""✓"", implying only one S exists).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two distinct letters from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word that starts with DE and ends with S.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: Same set, different from position 3

Looking for common words:
- DEBSS - invalid (double S)
- DECYS - not a word
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEFS_ - nothing
- DEGGS - not a word
- DEHYS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMOS - M and O, but O is excluded
- DEPYS - not a word
- DEWGS - not a word
- DEVOS - O excluded
- DEYS_ - nothing

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be ""DE _ _ S"" with no A,R,O,T,I,N,K and containing S only once (at position 5). The letters in positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining letters.

Looking at valid English words:
- DEWYS - not common

- DEGS_ - nothing
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - not a word
- DEPS_ - nothing

- DEWS_ - nothing

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let me think of words ending in S that start with DE and have no forbidden letters.

Actually, the word ""DEWYS"" is a surname but not common. However, ""DEWYS"" is valid.

But let me check if there's a more common word. ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEFFS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMOS"" has O. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Wait, ""DEWYS"" is 5 letters: D E W Y S. Let's check:
- D(✓) E(✓) W _ Y _ S
- W and Y are not in the excluded list.
- This seems to fit.

Is there any other? ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMYS"" is not valid. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Thus, ""DEWYS"" seems to be the only possible word fitting the pattern.

But let me verify:
- D E W Y S
- Letters: D, E, W, Y, S
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- W and Y are allowed
- S is allowed in position 5
- E in 2
- D in 1
- No S in 1 or 3 (first S was in 3 and marked -, so it must be elsewhere, which it is in 5)
- No E in 3 or 5 (it's in 2)
- No K

This seems correct.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with ""DE"" and ends with ""S"".
- It contains exactly one S (position 5), so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with other letters.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, the word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's think of words that fit:
- E and S must appear, so let's try to place E in position 1 or 2 and S in position 1-3 or 5.
- Example words: ""STEIN"" (but has A, R, O?), no, ""STEIN"" has I and N - but we don't have constraints on I or N yet.
Wait, ""STEIN"" has E in position 2 and S in position 1 - that's allowed since original positions were 4 and 5 for S and E.

But let's check if ""STEIN"" is valid - yes, it's a 5-letter word.

Another option: ""SEPT"" - but that's 4 letters, needs to be 5.
""SEWED"" - has D and W, but let's see: S in 1, E in 2 - allowed. But we have no info on D or W yet.

""STEEP"" - has two E's, but S is in 1, E's in 2 and 3 - allowed.
But ""STEEP"" uses P which we haven't tested yet.

""SHINE"" - has H, I, N - but S is in 1, E in 5 - but original E was in 5 (x), so E can't be in 5. So ""SHINE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""SPIKE"" - S in 1, P, I, K, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5. So invalid.

""SLICE"" - S in 1, L, I, C, E in 5 - again E in 5 is invalid.

""STEAK"" - E in 2, S in 1 - valid so far. But has A which we know is not in word. So invalid.

""STEIN"" seems valid - S in 1, E in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5. No A, R, or O. And S is not in 4, E is not in 5.

Let's go with ""STEIN"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and E must be in position 1, 2, or 4, with no overlap (since each letter appears once).

Possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then E must be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 3: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- If S is in position 5: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (excluding A,R,O,T,I,N): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- Contains S and E exactly once each.
- S not in 1 or 4.
- E not in 3 or 5.
- Uses only the available letters.

Try S in position 2 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E S _ _ _ → “ESPY” is 4 letters; “ESSEX” has X and repeats S. Not valid.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E D S _ _ → “EDS” + ? “EDSON” has O (invalid). “EDS” + “T” → “EDST” (invalid). Not working.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E S _ _
Possible word: D E S _ _ → “DESKS” (has K, S is in 3). Check constraints:
- S in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), K is new, D is new. No forbidden letters.
“DESKS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: D, E, S, K — all allowed.
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3) — OK.
- E not in 3 or 5 (it’s in 2) — OK.
- No A, R, O, T, I, N — OK.

Therefore, “DESKS” is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: DESKS -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the latest feedback carefully:

DESKS → D(✓) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)

1. D is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 2.
3. The first S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be elsewhere).
4. K is not in the word.
5. The second S is correct in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: D E _ _ S
- It contains exactly one S (since the first S was marked ""-"" and the second ""✓"", implying only one S exists).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two distinct letters from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word that starts with DE and ends with S.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: Same set, different from position 3

Looking for common words:
- DEBSS - invalid (double S)
- DECYS - not a word
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEFS_ - nothing
- DEGGS - not a word
- DEHYS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMOS - M and O, but O is excluded
- DEPYS - not a word
- DEWGS - not a word
- DEVOS - O excluded
- DEYS_ - nothing

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be ""DE _ _ S"" with no A,R,O,T,I,N,K and containing S only once (at position 5). The letters in positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining letters.

Looking at valid English words:
- DEWYS - not common
- DEFFS - not a word
- DEGS_ - nothing
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - not a word
- DEPS_ - nothing
- DEWS_ - nothing
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEGGS - not a word
- DEHYS - not a word
- DEJYS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - not a word
- DEPS_ - nothing
- DEWS_ - nothing

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let me think of words ending in S that start with DE and have no forbidden letters.

Actually, the word ""DEWYS"" is a surname but not common. However, ""DEWYS"" is valid.

But let me check if there's a more common word. ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEFFS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMOS"" has O. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Wait, ""DEWYS"" is 5 letters: D E W Y S. Let's check:
- D(✓) E(✓) W _ Y _ S
- W and Y are not in the excluded list.
- This seems to fit.

Is there any other? ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMYS"" is not valid. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Thus, ""DEWYS"" seems to be the only possible word fitting the pattern.

But let me verify:
- D E W Y S
- Letters: D, E, W, Y, S
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- W and Y are allowed
- S is allowed in position 5
- E in 2
- D in 1
- No S in 1 or 3 (first S was in 3 and marked -, so it must be elsewhere, which it is in 5)
- No E in 3 or 5 (it's in 2)
- No K

This seems correct.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with ""DE"" and ends with ""S"".
- It contains exactly one S (position 5), so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with other letters.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting ""DE _ _ S"" with no forbidden letters is:

Wait, let's focus on ""DE _ _ S"" with allowed letters:

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z

Possible valid words:
- DEBYS - Y excluded
- DECYS - not a word
- DEFYS - not a word

- DEHMS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - Y excluded
- DEPYS - not a word
- DEQFS - not a word
- DERBS - R excluded
- DETS_ - T excluded
- DEVIS - I excluded
- DEWYS - already tried
- DEZYS - not a word

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be ""DE _ _ S"" with no A, R, O, T, I, N, K, W, Y. The only remaining letters are B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Looking at valid English words:
- DEBUTS - but U is allowed, T is excluded
- DECYS - not a word
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEFGS - not a word
- DEHMS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMOS - O excluded
- DEPYS - not a word
- DEQFS - not a word
- DERBS - R excluded
- DETS_ - T excluded
- DEVIS - I excluded
- DEWYS - already tried
- DEZYS - not a word

Actually, ""DEBUTS"" is a word, but T is excluded. ""DEBUT"" is 4 letters. ""DEBYS"" is not valid. ""DECYS"" is not valid. ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEFGS"" is not valid. ""DEHMS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMYS"" is not valid. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEQFS"" is not valid. ""DERBS"" is not valid. ""DETIS"" is not valid. ""DEVIS"" is not valid. ""DEWYS"" is already tried. ""DEXYS"" is not a word. ""DEZYS"" is not a word.

This seems like there are no valid words left. But that can't be right. Let me think differently.

Wait, the word must be ""DE _ _ S"" with letters from the remaining set. Let me list possible combinations:

- DEBBS - but B is allowed, S is already in 5
- DECIS - I excluded
- DEFER - too short
- DEFFS - not a word
- DEGGs - not a word
- DEHHs - not a word
- DEJJs - not a word
- DELLS - L allowed, S in 5
- DEMOS - O excluded
- DEPPs - not a word
- DEPPS - not a word
- DEQQs - not a word
- DERMS - R excluded
- DETTS - T excluded
- DEVIS - I excluded
- DEWWS - W excluded
- DEZZS - not a word

""DELLS"" is a valid word: D E L L S. Let's check:
- D(✓) E(✓) L L S
- L is allowed
- No excluded letters
- Pattern matches

This seems to be the only valid word left.

<guess>DELLS</guess>Based on the feedback, the word must start with ""DE"" and end with ""S"", and the remaining letters must be chosen from the allowed set. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is:",Guess 5: DELLS -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) L(x) L(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these, the word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all high-frequency letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a well-balanced starting word that should give good information regardless of the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or O.

Now we need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible letters to use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's think of words that fit:
- E and S must appear, so let's try to place E in position 1 or 2 and S in position 1-3 or 5.
- Example words: ""STEIN"" (but has A, R, O?), no, ""STEIN"" has I and N - but we don't have constraints on I or N yet.
Wait, ""STEIN"" has E in position 2 and S in position 1 - that's allowed since original positions were 4 and 5 for S and E.

But let's check if ""STEIN"" is valid - yes, it's a 5-letter word.

Another option: ""SEPT"" - but that's 4 letters, needs to be 5.
""SEWED"" - has D and W, but let's see: S in 1, E in 2 - allowed. But we have no info on D or W yet.

""STEEP"" - has two E's, but S is in 1, E's in 2 and 3 - allowed.
But ""STEEP"" uses P which we haven't tested yet.

""SHINE"" - has H, I, N - but S is in 1, E in 5 - but original E was in 5 (x), so E can't be in 5. So ""SHINE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""SPIKE"" - S in 1, P, I, K, E in 5 - but E can't be in 5. So invalid.

""SLICE"" - S in 1, L, I, C, E in 5 - again E in 5 is invalid.

""STEAK"" - E in 2, S in 1 - valid so far. But has A which we know is not in word. So invalid.

""STEIN"" seems valid - S in 1, E in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5. No A, R, or O. And S is not in 4, E is not in 5.

Let's go with ""STEIN"".

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STEIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) E(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).

Summary of constraints so far:
Letters known to be in the word: S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEIN).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEIN).

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5, and E must be in position 1, 2, or 4, with no overlap (since each letter appears once).

Possible placements:
- If S is in position 2: then E must be in 1 or 4.
- If S is in position 3: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).
- If S is in position 5: then E must be in 1, 2, or 4.

Available letters (excluding A,R,O,T,I,N): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies:
- Contains S and E exactly once each.
- S not in 1 or 4.
- E not in 3 or 5.
- Uses only the available letters.

Try S in position 2 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E S _ _ _ → “ESPY” is 4 letters; “ESSEX” has X and repeats S. Not valid.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 1: E _ S _ _
Possible word: E D S _ _ → “EDS” + ? “EDSON” has O (invalid). “EDS” + “T” → “EDST” (invalid). Not working.

Try S in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E S _ _
Possible word: D E S _ _ → “DESKS” (has K, S is in 3). Check constraints:
- S in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (allowed), K is new, D is new. No forbidden letters.
“DESKS” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: D, E, S, K — all allowed.
- S not in 1 or 4 (it’s in 3) — OK.
- E not in 3 or 5 (it’s in 2) — OK.
- No A, R, O, T, I, N — OK.

Therefore, “DESKS” is a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)

Guess 3: DESKS -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's parse the latest feedback carefully:

DESKS → D(✓) E(✓) S(-) K(x) S(✓)

1. D is correct in position 1.
2. E is correct in position 2.
3. The first S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be elsewhere).
4. K is not in the word.
5. The second S is correct in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: D E _ _ S
- It contains exactly one S (since the first S was marked ""-"" and the second ""✓"", implying only one S exists).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two distinct letters from the available set, forming a valid 5-letter English word that starts with DE and ends with S.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: B, C, F, G, H, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: Same set, different from position 3

Looking for common words:
- DEBSS - invalid (double S)
- DECYS - not a word
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEFS_ - nothing
- DEGGS - not a word
- DEHYS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMOS - M and O, but O is excluded
- DEPYS - not a word
- DEWGS - not a word
- DEVOS - O excluded
- DEYS_ - nothing

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be ""DE _ _ S"" with no A,R,O,T,I,N,K and containing S only once (at position 5). The letters in positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining letters.

Looking at valid English words:
- DEWYS - not common
- DEFFS - not a word
- DEGS_ - nothing
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - not a word
- DEPS_ - nothing
- DEWS_ - nothing
- DEFYS - not a word
- DEGGS - not a word
- DEHYS - not a word
- DEJYS - not a word
- DELFS - not a word
- DEMYS - not a word
- DEPS_ - nothing
- DEWS_ - nothing

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let me think of words ending in S that start with DE and have no forbidden letters.

Actually, the word ""DEWYS"" is a surname but not common. However, ""DEWYS"" is valid.

But let me check if there's a more common word. ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEFFS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMOS"" has O. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Wait, ""DEWYS"" is 5 letters: D E W Y S. Let's check:
- D(✓) E(✓) W _ Y _ S
- W and Y are not in the excluded list.
- This seems to fit.

Is there any other? ""DEFYS"" is not valid. ""DEGGS"" is not valid. ""DELFS"" is not valid. ""DEMYS"" is not valid. ""DEPYS"" is not valid. ""DEWS"" is 4 letters. 

Thus, ""DEWYS"" seems to be the only possible word fitting the pattern.

But let me verify:
- D E W Y S
- Letters: D, E, W, Y, S
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K
- W and Y are allowed
- S is allowed in position 5
- E in 2
- D in 1
- No S in 1 or 3 (first S was in 3 and marked -, so it must be elsewhere, which it is in 5)
- No E in 3 or 5 (it's in 2)
- No K

This seems correct.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word starts with ""DE"" and ends with ""S"".
- It contains exactly one S (position 5), so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with other letters.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, K.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting ""DE _ _ S"" with no forbidden letters is:
