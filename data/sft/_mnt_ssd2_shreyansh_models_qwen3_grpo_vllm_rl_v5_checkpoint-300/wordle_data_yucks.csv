### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This gives us good information about which letters might be in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere except the 4th position.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
- Uses other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, C, etc.).

A good next guess is “STING”:
- Uses S in position 1 (not 4, so allowed).
- Uses common letters T, I, N, G that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, E).

From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G (all marked with x).
2. Letter S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (both guesses showed S with a “-”).

So the secret word:
- Contains S exactly once.
- S can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S).

We also want to test new common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Common consonants left include L, C, D, M, P, B, F, H, K.

A balanced word that:
- Places S in position 2 (middle slot).
- Uses other common remaining letters: C, L, U, M, P, etc.

One good candidate is “CUBIC” but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet. Another is “SULKS” but S is repeated. Instead, let’s try “SLUMP” but P is fine.

Actually, let’s pick “SULKY”:
- S in position 1 is ruled out, but position 2 is allowed.
- Uses U, L, K, Y — all new letters.

Wait, let’s double-check positions: S cannot be 1 or 4, so position 2, 3, or 5. “SULKY” has S in position 1 — that’s invalid.

Let’s try “PLUSH”:
- S in position 4 is invalid (from AROSE feedback).

Try “BUMPY”:
- No S, so invalid.

Try “FUSKY”:
- S in position 2 is allowed.
- Uses F, U, K, Y — all new.

This seems good.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, F.
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - U is in position 2 (✓).
   - K is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (all instances of S have been marked “-”).  
     Therefore S must be in position 5.
3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - Y is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from FUSKY feedback: Y(-)).

So the secret word has the form:
_ U _ K S
and must also contain Y somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (since Y cannot be in 5 and 2 and 4 are taken by U and K respectively).

Possible remaining consonants (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, H, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Remaining vowels: none except Y.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- Y must be in position 1 or 3.
- Position 3 (if Y is not there) or position 1 (if Y is not there) must be a consonant.

Case 1: Y in position 1 → Y U _ K S
The missing letter (position 3) must be a consonant not yet used. Common ones: B, C, D, H, L, M, P, V, W.
Possible words: YUCKS, YUDKS, YUHKS, etc. But “YUCKS” is a valid word (slang for “yuck” plural).

Case 2: Y in position 3 → _ U Y K S
The missing letter (position 1) must be a consonant. Possible words: B U Y K S, C U Y K S, D U Y K S, etc. However, “BUYKS”, “CUYKS”, “DUYKS” are not valid English words.

Therefore the only valid candidate is “YUCKS”.

Let me verify:
- Y in position 1: allowed (Y not ruled out of 1).
- U in position 2: ✓ (matches).
- C in position 3: not yet ruled out.
- K in position 4: ✓ (matches).
- S in position 5: allowed (S must be in 5, as all other positions are ruled out for S).

“YUCKS” is a valid 5-letter English word (slang plural of “yuck”).
