### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet and helping identify which vowels are in the word.

A good next guess would test I in position 3 and introduce two new common consonants. Let’s try “ASILD”:
- A and S are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- I in position 3 (new placement).
- L and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE
- CRANE
- STARE
- AROSE
- ADIEU

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet and helping identify which vowels are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So far we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
3. It does not contain R, O, or E.

Next, I’ll pick a word that:
- Starts with A.
- Uses S in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Avoids R, O, E.
- Introduces new common consonants and vowels (like T, I, N, L, etc.).

A good candidate is “ASTIN”:
- A in position 1 (confirmed correct).
- S in position 2 (new position).
- T, I, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A and has S in position 2.
2. Letters R, O, E, T, N are not in the word at all.
3. I is in the word but not in position 4.
4. S is already correctly placed in position 2, so we don’t need to test it elsewhere.

So the pattern so far is: A S _ _ _

We still need to place the letter I somewhere (positions 3 or 5, since position 4 is ruled out), and we need two more letters that haven’t been eliminated. The remaining common consonants that haven’t been tried are L, D, G, B, C, etc. and the remaining vowels are U (since A and I are already accounted for).

A good next guess would test I in position 3 and introduce two new common consonants. Let’s try “ASILD”:
- A and S are already confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
- I in position 3 (new placement).
- L and D are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us more information about the placement of I and whether L or D are in the word.

From all feedback so far:

- Fixed pattern: A S _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, L, D, C, K
- I is in the word but cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it was marked “-” in positions 3, 4, and 5 across the four guesses).
- Therefore the only remaining legal position for I is position 2.  
  But position 2 is already occupied by S (✓), so this is impossible.

This contradiction means my assumption that I must appear somewhere is being misread.  
Rechecking the feedback:

- Guess 2: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Guess 3: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Guess 4: I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (again).

So I cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and position 5 was never tested for I in Guess 4 (I was in position 3 of ASICK).  
Thus I could still be in position 2 or 5.

But position 2 is already S (✓), so I must be in position 5.

We still need one consonant for position 3 from letters not yet eliminated: B, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “ASUBY”:
- A S _ _ _
- U in position 4 (new vowel test)
- B in position 3 (new consonant)
- Y in position 5 (but we need I in position 5, so this is wrong)

Let’s try “ASIBY”:
- A S I B Y
- I in position 3 (but we know I cannot be in position 3 from Guess 3)

Let’s try “ASIB_” with remaining letters.

Wait, the only remaining legal placement for I is position 5. So the word must be A S _ _ I.

Now we need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from remaining letters: B, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A common pair is B and M → “ASBMI” (invalid, not a word)

Try “ASUMI” (valid word, U and M are new)

Let’s check ASUMI:
- A S U M I
- U in position 3 (new vowel test)
- M in position 4 (new consonant)
- I in position 5 (only legal spot left)

This tests U and M while satisfying all constraints.

From the latest feedback:

- Pattern: A S _ _ I
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, L, D, C, K, U, M
- We still need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from the remaining unused letters: B, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit A S _ _ I with these consonants:

- ASB I → no common word
- ASF I → no common word
- ASG I → no common word
- ASH I → ""ASHI"" (but needs 5 letters)
- ASP I → ""ASPI"" (no)
- ASV I → no
- ASW I → no
- ASY I → no

Wait, let's list possible combinations:

- ASB + remaining consonants: ASBY? (no)
- ASH + remaining consonants: ASH + B, F, G, P, V, W, Y
  - ASHBI - invalid
  - ASHFI - invalid
  - ASHGI - invalid
  - ASHPI - invalid
  - ASHVI - invalid
  - ASHWD - invalid
  - ASHY - invalid

Looking at valid English words:

- ASHES - but E is already excluded
- ASHOK - O is excluded
- ASHRA - R is excluded
- ASHTE - T is excluded
- ASHWA - W is allowed, but A is already in position 1
- ASHYS - Y is allowed, S is already in position 2

Wait, let's think differently. The word must be A S _ _ I with two consonants in positions 3 and 4 from B, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

Possible combinations:

- ASB + Y → ASBY (invalid word)
- ASH + Y → ASHY (valid word)
- ASP + Y → ASPY (invalid)
- ASB + H → ASHB (invalid)
- ASH + B → ASHB (invalid)

""ASHY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""related to ashes"" or ""dull-colored"".

Let's check if ASHY violates any constraints:

- A(✓) S(✓) H(new) Y(new) I(✓)
- H and Y are both new letters not previously tested
- All other letters are either confirmed or new

This seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints.
