1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

One candidate: ""TREAD"" – but it has an R and a T, but also an R which we know is invalid.
Another: ""LEANT"" – has an S (no, that’s not it) and an R.
""PEACH"" – has C and H, no R, O, or S, and has A and E. Let’s check positions: P-E-A-C-H. A is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can quickly reveal which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons.

From the three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in word, not position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in word.
   - E is in word, not position 5.

2. PEACH → P(✓) E(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
   - P is correct in position 1.
   - E is in word, not position 2.
   - A is in word, not position 3.
   - C, H are not in word.

3. PLEAD → P(✓) L(x) E(-) A(-) D(✓)
   - P is correct in position 1 (already known).
   - L is not in word.
   - E is in word, not position 3.
   - A is in word, not position 4.
   - D is correct in position 5.

So far we have:
- Word structure: P _ _ _ D
- Must contain: A and E (positions unknown, but not 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively from previous feedback).
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, C, H, L.

Possible positions for A and E:
- A cannot be in 1, 3, 4 → must be in 2 or 5. But 5 is D, so A must be in 2.
- E cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → must be in 4.

Thus the word must be: P A E _ D, but that's 5 letters: P A E _ D → PAED? but we need 5 letters. Wait, positions:

Actually, positions:
- P is fixed at 1.
- D is fixed at 5.
- A must be in 2 (only remaining possible position).
- E must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5, and not 3 from PLEAD feedback shows E is not in 3). Wait, PLEAD feedback says E(-) meaning E is not in position 3. From PEACH, E is not in 2. From AROSE, E is not in 5. So E must be in 3 or 4, but not 3 (from PLEAD), so E must be in 4.

Thus structure: P _ _ E D, and must contain A somewhere. A must be in position 2 or 3.

But from PLEAD, A(-) means A is not in position 4 (already known) and not in position 1 (from AROSE). From PEACH, A is not in position 3. So A must be in position 2.

Thus word: P A _ E D.

Now we need a valid 5-letter word fitting P A _ E D. The missing letter (position 3) must not be any of the excluded letters: R, O, S, C, H, L.

Possible letters for position 3: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- PABED - not a valid word.
- PAKED - not valid.
- PAMED - not valid.
- PANED - yes, ""NANED"" no, but ""PANED"" is valid (past tense of pane).
- PAWED - yes, ""PAWED"" is valid (past tense of paw).
- PAVED - yes, ""PAVED"" is valid (past tense of pave).

Let's check:
- PANED: P A N E D - valid word.
- PAWED: P A W E D - valid word.
- PAVED: P A V E D - valid word.

All fit. Let's pick one. ""PAVED"" seems common.

Based on the feedback, the word must start with P and end with D, contain both A and E, and cannot include R, O, S, C, H, or L. The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is:
