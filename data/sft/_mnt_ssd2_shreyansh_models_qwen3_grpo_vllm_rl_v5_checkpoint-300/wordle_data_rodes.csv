For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters R, O, S, E (each exactly once) plus one more unknown letter. The positions of R, O, S, E in AROSE (positions 2,3,4,5) are all wrong, so they must appear in positions 1 or the remaining position not used in AROSE.

Since we have 4 known letters, the unknown letter must be in position 1 or 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 were used in AROSE but are wrong). But since R, O, S, E are all in the word, the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been tested yet.

Looking at common letters not yet tested: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would be to test a new consonant while placing the known letters in new positions. Let's try ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter in position 2
- O moves from position 3 to 3 (but this is the same position as before - bad)
Wait, O was in position 3 and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me rethink.

Better approach: Since R, O, S, E must be rearranged, and A is out, let's try a word that uses all four known letters plus a new letter, with none of the known letters in their previous positions.

Possible candidates: ""ROSES"" (but S is repeated - bad), ""ROTES"" (but T is new), ""SORES"" (S repeated), ""TROES"" (but E is in position 5 same as AROSE - bad).

Better: ""TORSI"" - but I is new, and positions are:
T(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), I(5)
Check against AROSE positions:
A(1) - new letter T
R(2) - was in 2 (bad, must move)
So TORSI is invalid because R is still in position 2.

Next: ""SERTO"" - but this seems obscure.

Better: ""CREST"" - but C is new, and we have:
C(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), T(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (bad - still 2)
E was in 5 (bad - now 3)
S was in 4 (bad - now 4)
O is missing - bad.

We need a word that contains R, O, S, E in different positions than AROSE, plus one new letter.

Let's try ""ROTES"":
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (now 1 - good)
O was in 3 (now 2 - good)

Wait, O was in position 3 and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me rethink.

Better approach: Since R, O, S, E must be rearranged, and A is out, let's try a word that uses all four known letters plus a new letter, with none of the known letters in their previous positions.

Possible candidates: ""ROSES"" (but S is repeated - bad), ""ROTES"" (but T is new), ""SORES"" (S repeated), ""TROES"" (but E is in position 5 same as AROSE - bad).

Better: ""TORSI"" - but I is new, and positions are:
T(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), I(5)
Check against AROSE positions:
A(1) - new letter T
R(2) - was in 2 (bad, must move)
So TORSI is invalid because R is still in position 2.

Next: ""SERTO"" - but this seems obscure.

Better: ""CREST"" - but C is new, and we have:
C(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), T(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (bad - still 2)
E was in 5 (bad - now 3)
S was in 4 (bad - now 4)
O is missing - bad.

We need a word that contains R, O, S, E in different positions than AROSE, plus one new letter.

Let's try ""ROTES"":
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (now 1 - good)
O was in 3 (now 2 - good)
S was in 4 (now 5 - good)
E was in 5 (now 4 - good)
T is new in 3 - good.

This seems valid. ""ROTES"" uses all known letters in new positions plus a new letter T.

From the new feedback on ROTES:
- R is in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is R
- O is in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is O
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is E
- S is in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is S

So the word structure is: R O _ E S

The missing letter is in position 3. From previous feedback, we know the word must contain R, O, S, E (all present here) and the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been tested yet (since A and T are out). Common unused consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

Looking at the pattern R O _ E S, possible letters for position 3:
- N → RONES (valid word)
- L → ROLLS (but L is repeated - invalid)
- C → ROCES (not a common word)
- D → RODES (valid, but D is common)
- M → ROMES (valid)

""RONES"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""relating to the Romans"". Let's check:
- R(1) ✓

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters R, O, S, E (each exactly once) plus one more unknown letter. The positions of R, O, S, E in AROSE (positions 2,3,4,5) are all wrong, so they must appear in positions 1 or the remaining position not used in AROSE.

Since we have 4 known letters, the unknown letter must be in position 1 or 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 were used in AROSE but are wrong). But since R, O, S, E are all in the word, the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been tested yet.

Looking at common letters not yet tested: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would be to test a new consonant while placing the known letters in new positions. Let's try ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter in position 2
- O moves from position 3 to 3 (but this is the same position as before - bad)
Wait, O was in position 3 and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me rethink.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- Two very common consonants (R, S) that appear in many English words
- No repeated letters, giving maximum coverage

This should provide good feedback on multiple common letters and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R, O, S, E are all in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word must contain the letters R, O, S, E (each exactly once) plus one more unknown letter. The positions of R, O, S, E in AROSE (positions 2,3,4,5) are all wrong, so they must appear in positions 1 or the remaining position not used in AROSE.

Since we have 4 known letters, the unknown letter must be in position 1 or 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 were used in AROSE but are wrong). But since R, O, S, E are all in the word, the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been tested yet.

Looking at common letters not yet tested: T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would be to test a new consonant while placing the known letters in new positions. Let's try ""STORE"":
- S moves from position 4 to 1
- T is a new letter in position 2
- O moves from position 3 to 3 (but this is the same position as before - bad)
Wait, O was in position 3 and got (-), so it can't be in position 3 again. Let me rethink.

Better approach: Since R, O, S, E must be rearranged, and A is out, let's try a word that uses all four known letters plus a new letter, with none of the known letters in their previous positions.

Possible candidates: ""ROSES"" (but S is repeated - bad), ""ROTES"" (but T is new), ""SORES"" (S repeated), ""TROES"" (but E is in position 5 same as AROSE - bad).

Better: ""TORSI"" - but I is new, and positions are:
T(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), I(5)
Check against AROSE positions:
A(1) - new letter T
R(2) - was in 2 (bad, must move)
So TORSI is invalid because R is still in position 2.

Next: ""SERTO"" - but this seems obscure.

Better: ""CREST"" - but C is new, and we have:
C(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), T(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (bad - still 2)
E was in 5 (bad - now 3)
S was in 4 (bad - now 4)
O is missing - bad.

We need a word that contains R, O, S, E in different positions than AROSE, plus one new letter.

Let's try ""ROTES"":
R(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), S(5)
Check positions:
R was in 2 (now 1 - good)
O was in 3 (now 2 - good)
S was in 4 (now 5 - good)
E was in 5 (now 4 - good)
T is new in 3 - good.

This seems valid. ""ROTES"" uses all known letters in new positions plus a new letter T.

Guess 2: ROTES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) T(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROTES:
- R is in the correct position (✓) → position 1 is R
- O is in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is O
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the correct position (✓) → position 4 is E
- S is in the correct position (✓) → position 5 is S

So the word structure is: R O _ E S

The missing letter is in position 3. From previous feedback, we know the word must contain R, O, S, E (all present here) and the fifth letter must be one that hasn't been tested yet (since A and T are out). Common unused consonants: N, L, C, D, etc.

Looking at the pattern R O _ E S, possible letters for position 3:
- N → RONES (valid word)
- L → ROLLS (but L is repeated - invalid)
- C → ROCES (not a common word)
- D → RODES (valid, but D is common)
- M → ROMES (valid)

""RONES"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning ""relating to the Romans"". Let's check:
- R(1) ✓
- O(2) ✓
- N(3) new
- E(4) ✓
- S(5) ✓

This fits perfectly.
