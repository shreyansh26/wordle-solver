For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think about why this is a good first guess:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many possible 5-letter words
4. It gives us good information about letter positions as well

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (1st letter): x → not in the word
- R (2nd letter): - → in the word but wrong position
- O (3rd letter): x → not in the word
- S (4th letter): - → in the word but wrong position
- E (5th letter): x → not in the word

So we know:
- The word contains R and S, but neither is in its current spot (R≠2nd, S≠4th).
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.

I need a new word that:
1. Uses R and S (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Doesn’t use A, O, or E.
3. Places R somewhere other than the 2nd position.
4. Places S somewhere other than the 4th position.
5. Uses other common letters to narrow things down.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let me try a word like “TRIPS”:
- T, R, I, P, S
- R is in position 2 → but feedback said R is NOT in position 2. So that’s bad.

Try “CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R is in position 2 → again violates the feedback.

Try “FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T
- R is in position 3 (allowed), S is in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4). So S is in wrong spot here too.

Try “SHIRT”:
- S, H, I, R, T
- S is in position 1 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed), I is in position 3 (allowed), H and T are new letters.

This seems valid:
- Uses confirmed letters S and R.
- Doesn’t use A, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), R is in position 4 (not 2).
- Introduces H and T to test new letters.

So my next guess is SHIRT.

Try “SHIRT”:
- S, H, I, R, T
- S is in position 1 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed), I is in position 3 (allowed), H and T are new letters.

This seems valid:
- Uses confirmed letters S and R.
- Doesn’t use A, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4), R is in position 4 (not 2).
- Introduces H and T to test new letters.

So my next guess is SHIRT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SHIRT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) R(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word contains S (in position 1) and R (somewhere, but not position 2 or 4).
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, E, H, I, T.
3. The remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) must be filled with letters we haven’t ruled out yet: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since R must appear and cannot be in positions 2 or 4, the only possible positions for R are 3 or 5.

Let’s try a word that:
- Starts with S.
- Places R in position 3 (a common placement).
- Uses other still-allowed consonants.

A good candidate is “SPURN”:
- S (✓) in position 1.
- P, U, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- R in position 3 (allowed).
- Doesn’t use any ruled-out letters.

This gives us information about P, U, N and confirms R’s placement if it hits.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet\'s most common letters.\n\nAnother popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.\n\nLet me think about why this is a good first guess:\n1.

From the three rounds we have:

1. S is fixed in position 1.
2. R must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (because in SPURN it was in position 4 and got “-”, and in SHIRT it was in position 4 and got “-”).  
   Therefore R must be in position 3.
3. U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SPURN feedback: U(-)).
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, O, E, H, I, T, P, N.
5. Remaining positions to fill: 2 and 4 (since 1 and 3 are fixed as S and R respectively), and we still need to place U somewhere.

So the word structure is: S _ R _ _  
U must go in position 2 or 4 or 5, but:
- Position 3 is R, so U cannot be there (already known).
- From SPURN: U(-) means U is not in position 3 (already known), but could still be 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try placing U in position 2: S U R _ _  
We need two more consonants for positions 4 and 5, chosen from letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common ending after “SUR” is “RY” or “SM” etc.  
Let’s try “SURDY” – but D and Y haven’t been tested yet, and it’s a valid word.

However, “SURDY” might be obscure. A better common word is “SURGE” – but E is ruled out.  
“SURFY” – Y is allowed, F is allowed.  
“SURFY” seems reasonable.

Let me check:  
S(✓) U(?) R(✓) F(?) Y(?)  
- S is fixed in 1.  
- R is fixed in 3.  
- U is in position 2 (new placement).  
- F and Y are new letters to test.

This seems optimal.
