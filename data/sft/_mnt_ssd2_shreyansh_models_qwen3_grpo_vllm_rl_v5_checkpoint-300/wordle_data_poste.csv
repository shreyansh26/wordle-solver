For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct letters that are among the most common. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word, and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common vowels. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, or 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Does not contain A or R.

Let me think of words:
- O and S must appear, and E is fixed at position 5.
- Possible candidates: ""STONE"" (but R is excluded, and S is in position 1, O in position 2, T in position 3, E in 5 - this seems valid), ""SPOKE"" (but R is excluded, and S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5 - but O is in position 3 which was marked as wrong position for O in AROSE, so O cannot be in 3), ""SLOPE"" (S in 1, L in 2, O in 3, P in 4, E in 5 - again O in 3 is invalid), ""HOUSE"" (but S is in position 3 here, which is allowed since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, so position 3 is ok), but H is not excluded yet.

Wait, ""HOUSE"" has:
- H: not tested yet
- O: position 2 (allowed, since in AROSE O was in position 3 and marked as wrong position)
- U: not tested yet
- S: position 3 (allowed, since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position)
- E: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid. Also, ""HOUSE"" uses new letters H and U which could provide more information.

Another option: ""SPOKE"" - but O is in position 3 which was invalid in AROSE, so no.
""STOLE"" - O in position 3, invalid.
""SONIC"" - ends with C, not E.
""SOBER"" - ends with R, but R is excluded.
""SOYED"" - ends with D.
""STOKE"" - ends with E, O in position 2, S in position 1, T in 3, K in 4 - this seems valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""STOKE"", ""HOUSE"" has more unique letters (H, O, U, S, E) while ""STOKE"" has S, T, O, K, E. Both are good, but ""HOUSE"" might give more info on H and U.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O is now locked in position 2.
   - E is again in position 5 (✓), confirmed.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from HOUSE). So S must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is excluded, so S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 3 and 4: unknown letters, not A, R, H, U, and must be distinct.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, H, U, and S, O, E already placed): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4. Let's think of common combinations:
- COEDS? No, E is fixed at 5.
- S O _ _ E
- Common words: SOBEE (invalid, B and E), SOFIE (invalid, F and I), SOLVE (invalid, V), SONGS (invalid, N and G), SOAPY (invalid, P and Y), SORRY (invalid, R), SOTOL (invalid, T and L), SOWPE (invalid, W and P).

Wait, ""SOLVE"" has V which is allowed, but S is already in position 1, O in 2, L in 3, V in 4, E in 5. That's ""SOLVE"".

Another option: ""SONIC"" - but C is allowed, N is allowed, I is allowed, but E must be in position 5, so ""SONIC"" is invalid.

""SOPOR"" - but R is excluded.

""SOFTY"" - F and T and Y are allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.

""SOLAR"" - A and R excluded.

""SOLID"" - D is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed. ""SOLID"" is a valid word.

Between ""SOLVE"" and ""SOLID"":
- SOLVE: S O L V E
- SOLID: S O L I D

Both fit the constraints. ""SOLVE"" has V, ""SOLID"" has I and D. Let's pick ""SOLVE"" first as it's more common.

But wait, in ""SOLVE"":
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L is new
- V is new
- E is in position 5 (✓)

This seems correct. Let's go with ""SOLVE"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5
- O is locked in position 2
- S must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4)
- Letters not in word: A, R, H, U

The word must be S O _ _ E. The most common valid word fitting this is ""SOLVE"".

   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4. Let's think of common combinations:
- COEDS? No, E is fixed at 5.
- S O _ _ E
- Common words: SOBEE (invalid, B and E), SOFIE (invalid, F and I), SOLVE (invalid, V), SONGS (invalid, N and G), SOAPY (invalid, P and Y), SORRY (invalid, R), SOTOL (invalid, T and L), SOWPE (invalid, W and P).

Wait, ""SOLVE"" has V which is allowed, but S is already in position 1, O in 2, L in 3, V in 4, E in 5. That's ""SOLVE"".

Another option: ""SONIC"" - but C is allowed, N is allowed, I is allowed, but E must be in position 5, so ""SONIC"" is invalid.

""SOPOR"" - but R is excluded.

""SOFTY"" - F and T and Y are allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.

""SOLAR"" - A and R excluded.

""SOLID"" - D is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed. ""SOLID"" is a valid word.

Between ""SOLVE"" and ""SOLID"":
- SOLVE: S O L V E
- SOLID: S O L I D

Both fit the constraints. ""SOLVE"" has V, ""SOLID"" has I and D. Let's pick ""SOLVE"" first as it's more common.

But wait, in ""SOLVE"":
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L is new
- V is new
- E is in position 5 (✓)

This seems correct. Let's go with ""SOLVE"".Based on the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5
- O is locked in position 2
- S must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct letters that are among the most common. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word, and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common vowels. I'll go with AROSE as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, or 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Does not contain A or R.

Let me think of words:
- O and S must appear, and E is fixed at position 5.
- Possible candidates: ""STONE"" (but R is excluded, and S is in position 1, O in position 2, T in position 3, E in 5 - this seems valid), ""SPOKE"" (but R is excluded, and S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5 - but O is in position 3 which was marked as wrong position for O in AROSE, so O cannot be in 3), ""SLOPE"" (S in 1, L in 2, O in 3, P in 4, E in 5 - again O in 3 is invalid), ""HOUSE"" (but S is in position 3 here, which is allowed since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, so position 3 is ok), but H is not excluded yet.

Wait, ""HOUSE"" has:
- H: not tested yet
- O: position 2 (allowed, since in AROSE O was in position 3 and marked as wrong position)
- U: not tested yet
- S: position 3 (allowed, since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position)
- E: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid. Also, ""HOUSE"" uses new letters H and U which could provide more information.

Another option: ""SPOKE"" - but O is in position 3 which was invalid in AROSE, so no.
""STOLE"" - O in position 3, invalid.
""SONIC"" - ends with C, not E.
""SOBER"" - ends with R, but R is excluded.
""SOYED"" - ends with D.
""STOKE"" - ends with E, O in position 2, S in position 1, T in 3, K in 4 - this seems valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""STOKE"", ""HOUSE"" has more unique letters (H, O, U, S, E) while ""STOKE"" has S, T, O, K, E. Both are good, but ""HOUSE"" might give more info on H and U.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O is now locked in position 2.
   - E is again in position 5 (✓), confirmed.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from HOUSE). So S must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is excluded, so S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 3 and 4: unknown letters, not A, R, H, U, and must be distinct.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, H, U, and S, O, E already placed): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4. Let's think of common combinations:
- COEDS? No, E is fixed at 5.
- S O _ _ E
- Common words: SOBEE (invalid, B and E), SOFIE (invalid, F and I), SOLVE (invalid, V), SONGS (invalid, N and G), SOAPY (invalid, P and Y), SORRY (invalid, R), SOTOL (invalid, T and L), SOWPE (invalid, W and P).

Wait, ""SOLVE"" has V which is allowed, but S is already in position 1, O in 2, L in 3, V in 4, E in 5. That's ""SOLVE"".

Another option: ""SONIC"" - but C is allowed, N is allowed, I is allowed, but E must be in position 5, so ""SONIC"" is invalid.

""SOPOR"" - but R is excluded.

""SOFTY"" - F and T and Y are allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.

""SOLAR"" - A and R excluded.

""SOLID"" - D is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed. ""SOLID"" is a valid word.

Between ""SOLVE"" and ""SOLID"":
- SOLVE: S O L V E
- SOLID: S O L I D

Both fit the constraints. ""SOLVE"" has V, ""SOLID"" has I and D. Let's pick ""SOLVE"" first as it's more common.

But wait, in ""SOLVE"":
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L is new
- V is new
- E is in position 5 (✓)

This seems correct. Let's go with ""SOLVE"".Based on the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5
- O is locked in position 2
- S must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4)
- Letters not in word: A, R, H, U

The word must be S O _ _ E. The most common valid word fitting this is ""SOLVE"".

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from HOUSE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE).  
     Therefore S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

3. SOLVE → S(-) O(✓) L(x) V(x) E(✓)
   - O is still in position 2 (✓).
   - E is still in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from SOLVE), yet we already deduced S must be in position 1.  
     This is a contradiction, so our earlier deduction must be re-examined.

Re-examining S:
- From AROSE: S not in position 4.
- From HOUSE: S not in position 3.
- From SOLVE: S not in position 1.
Therefore S must be in position 4, but position 4 was already excluded by AROSE.  
This is impossible, so the only resolution is that our assumption that S must be in position 1 was wrong.

Let’s re-derive S positions:
- Allowed positions for S: positions where it has NOT been marked “-”.
  - AROSE: S not in 4.
  - HOUSE: S not in 3.
  - SOLVE: S not in 1.
So S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Position 2 is O (✓), so S must be in position 4.

Thus:
- Position 4: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 1 and 3: unknown letters, not A, R, H, U, L, V.

So the word pattern is: _ O _ S E.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 3.

Common valid words matching _ O _ S E:
- BOISE (but I and B are allowed)
- COOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- DOUSE (but U is excluded)
- FOIST (but T is allowed, I is allowed)
- GOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- JOISE (valid but rare)
- MOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- NOISE (N, I allowed)
- POISE (P, I allowed)
- TOISE (T, I allowed)

The most common valid word fitting _ O _ S E is “NOISE”.

Check:
- N: new, allowed
- O: position 2 (✓)
- I: new, allowed
- S: position 4 (✓)
- E: position 5 (✓)

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- Does NOT contain A or R.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1, 2, or 4.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, or 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains O and S in allowed positions.
- Does not contain A or R.

Let me think of words:
- O and S must appear, and E is fixed at position 5.
- Possible candidates: ""STONE"" (but R is excluded, and S is in position 1, O in position 2, T in position 3, E in 5 - this seems valid), ""SPOKE"" (but R is excluded, and S in 1, P in 2, O in 3, K in 4, E in 5 - but O is in position 3 which was marked as wrong position for O in AROSE, so O cannot be in 3), ""SLOPE"" (S in 1, L in 2, O in 3, P in 4, E in 5 - again O in 3 is invalid), ""HOUSE"" (but S is in position 3 here, which is allowed since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, so position 3 is ok), but H is not excluded yet.

Wait, ""HOUSE"" has:
- H: not tested yet
- O: position 2 (allowed, since in AROSE O was in position 3 and marked as wrong position)
- U: not tested yet
- S: position 3 (allowed, since in AROSE S was in position 4 and marked as wrong position)
- E: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid. Also, ""HOUSE"" uses new letters H and U which could provide more information.

Another option: ""SPOKE"" - but O is in position 3 which was invalid in AROSE, so no.
""STOLE"" - O in position 3, invalid.
""SONIC"" - ends with C, not E.
""SOBER"" - ends with R, but R is excluded.
""SOYED"" - ends with D.
""STOKE"" - ends with E, O in position 2, S in position 1, T in 3, K in 4 - this seems valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""STOKE"", ""HOUSE"" has more unique letters (H, O, U, S, E) while ""STOKE"" has S, T, O, K, E. Both are good, but ""HOUSE"" might give more info on H and U.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O is now locked in position 2.
   - E is again in position 5 (✓), confirmed.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (from AROSE) and not in position 3 (from HOUSE). So S must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is excluded, so S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 3 and 4: unknown letters, not A, R, H, U, and must be distinct.

Possible letters left (excluding A, R, H, U, and S, O, E already placed): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4. Let's think of common combinations:
- COEDS? No, E is fixed at 5.
- S O _ _ E
- Common words: SOBEE (invalid, B and E), SOFIE (invalid, F and I), SOLVE (invalid, V), SONGS (invalid, N and G), SOAPY (invalid, P and Y), SORRY (invalid, R), SOTOL (invalid, T and L), SOWPE (invalid, W and P).

Wait, ""SOLVE"" has V which is allowed, but S is already in position 1, O in 2, L in 3, V in 4, E in 5. That's ""SOLVE"".

Another option: ""SONIC"" - but C is allowed, N is allowed, I is allowed, but E must be in position 5, so ""SONIC"" is invalid.

""SOPOR"" - but R is excluded.

""SOFTY"" - F and T and Y are allowed, but is it a word? Maybe.

""SOLAR"" - A and R excluded.

""SOLID"" - D is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed. ""SOLID"" is a valid word.

Between ""SOLVE"" and ""SOLID"":
- SOLVE: S O L V E
- SOLID: S O L I D

Both fit the constraints. ""SOLVE"" has V, ""SOLID"" has I and D. Let's pick ""SOLVE"" first as it's more common.

But wait, in ""SOLVE"":
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L is new
- V is new
- E is in position 5 (✓)

This seems correct. Let's go with ""SOLVE"".Based on the feedback:
- E is locked in position 5
- O is locked in position 2
- S must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 3 or 4)
- Letters not in word: A, R, H, U

The word must be S O _ _ E. The most common valid word fitting this is ""SOLVE"".

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from HOUSE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE).  
     Therefore S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

3. SOLVE → S(-) O(✓) L(x) V(x) E(✓)
   - O is still in position 2 (✓).
   - E is still in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from SOLVE), yet we already deduced S must be in position 1.  
     This is a contradiction, so our earlier deduction must be re-examined.

Re-examining S:
- From AROSE: S not in position 4.
- From HOUSE: S not in position 3.
- From SOLVE: S not in position 1.
Therefore S must be in position 4, but position 4 was already excluded by AROSE.  
This is impossible, so the only resolution is that our assumption that S must be in position 1 was wrong.

Let’s re-derive S positions:
- Allowed positions for S: positions where it has NOT been marked “-”.
  - AROSE: S not in 4.
  - HOUSE: S not in 3.
  - SOLVE: S not in 1.
So S must be in position 2 or 5.
- Position 2 is O (✓), so S must be in position 4.

Thus:
- Position 4: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Positions 1 and 3: unknown letters, not A, R, H, U, L, V.

So the word pattern is: _ O _ S E.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 1 and 3.

Common valid words matching _ O _ S E:
- BOISE (but I and B are allowed)
- COOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- DOUSE (but U is excluded)
- FOIST (but T is allowed, I is allowed)
- GOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- JOISE (valid but rare)
- MOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- NOISE (N, I allowed)
- POISE (P, I allowed)
- TOISE (T, I allowed)

The most common valid word fitting _ O _ S E is “NOISE”.

Check:
- N: new, allowed
- O: position 2 (✓)
- I: new, allowed
- S: position 4 (✓)
- E: position 5 (✓)

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A and R are not in the word.

2. HOUSE → H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from HOUSE) and NOT in position 4 (from AROSE).  
     Therefore S must be in position 1 or 2, but position 2 is O, so S must be in position 1.
   - H and U are not in the word.

3. SOLVE → S(-) O(✓) L(x) V(x) E(✓)
   - O is still in position 2 (✓).
   - E is still in position 5 (✓).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from SOLVE), yet we deduced S must be in position 1.  
     This contradiction implies our earlier deduction was flawed.

Re-examining S:
- From AROSE: S not in position 4.
- From HOUSE: S not in position 3.
- From SOLVE: S not in position 1.
- From NOISE: S not in position 4 (again) and not in position 3 (from NOISE).
Thus, S must be in position 2, but position 2 is O (✓). This is impossible.

This contradiction means our assumption that O is in position 2 must be re-evaluated. Let’s carefully re-interpret the feedback:

- HOUSE feedback: H(x) O(✓) U(x) S(-) E(✓)
  - O(✓) means O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).

- SOLVE feedback: S(-) O(✓) L(x) V(x) E(✓)
  - O(✓) confirms O is in position 2.
  - S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1.

- NOISE feedback: N(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) E(✓)
  - O(✓) confirms position 2.
  - S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.

Combining all:
- Positions: _ O _ _ E
- S must be in the word, possible positions: 3 (since 1,2,4 are excluded).
Thus, S must be in position 3.

So the word pattern is: _ O S _ E.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, H, U, L, V, N, I).

We need one letter for position 1 and one for position 4.

Common valid words matching _ O S _ E:
- BOSES (invalid, S repeated)
- COSES (invalid)
- DOSER (R excluded)
- FOSSE (invalid)
- GOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- JOSIE (I excluded)
- KOSER (R excluded)
- MOSSE (invalid)
- POSSE (invalid)
- TOSSE (invalid)

The only valid word fitting _ O S _ E with allowed letters is ""POSSE"", but it has repeated S. This suggests we may have missed a letter.

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- P O S T E → ""POSTE"" (valid)
- P O S E (invalid, 5 letters)
- T O S T E → ""TASTE"" (but A excluded)
- M O S T E → ""MOSTE"" (valid but rare)
- P O S S E → invalid (S repeated)

""POSTE"" is a valid word (French-derived, means ""the one"" in English contexts).

Thus, the most reasonable next guess is ""POSTE"".
</think>

From all feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 3 (only remaining spot).
- Positions 1 and 4 must be filled with unused allowed letters.

The pattern is: _ O S _ E.

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting this is ""POSTE"".

- S must be in the word, possible positions: 3 (since 1,2,4 are excluded).
Thus, S must be in position 3.

So the word pattern is: _ O S _ E.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, R, H, U, L, V, N, I).

We need one letter for position 1 and one for position 4.

Common valid words matching _ O S _ E:
- BOSES (invalid, S repeated)
- COSES (invalid)
- DOSER (R excluded)
- FOSSE (invalid)
- GOOSE (invalid, O repeated)
- JOSIE (I excluded)
- KOSER (R excluded)
- MOSSE (invalid)
- POSSE (invalid)
- TOSSE (invalid)

The only valid word fitting _ O S _ E with allowed letters is ""POSSE"", but it has repeated S. This suggests we may have missed a letter.

Wait, let’s list allowed letters again: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- P O S T E → ""POSTE"" (valid)
- P O S E (invalid, 5 letters)
- T O S T E → ""TASTE"" (but A excluded)
- M O S T E → ""MOSTE"" (valid but rare)
- P O S S E → invalid (S repeated)

""POSTE"" is a valid word (French-derived, means ""the one"" in English contexts).

Thus, the most reasonable next guess is ""POSTE"".From all feedback:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- O is in position 2.
- S is in position 3 (only remaining spot).
- Positions 1 and 4 must be filled with unused allowed letters.

The pattern is: _ O S _ E.

Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting this is ""POSTE"".",Guess 5: POSTE -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) S(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
