For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O
- We still need to find the correct positions for A and O, and identify the other three letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and O in new positions.
2. Avoid R, S, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Possible candidates: ADIEU (but E is out), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALONG (but G is less common), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALOUD (but D is less common).

""ADOPT"" is good: uses A and O in new positions, and introduces D, P, T (common letters). But P is less common than T.

""ALERT"" uses A and O (but O isn't in it), so skip.

""ADORN"" uses A and O, but R is out.

""ACORN"" uses A, O, C, N. C and N are common, and we haven't tested them yet.

""ACORN"" seems like a strong second guess.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, T, L

Current constraints:
- N is locked in position 3.
- A must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- O must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

The only remaining positions for A are 5, and for O are 1 or 4.

So the word looks like:
- Position 1: O or untested consonant
- Position 2: untested consonant
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O or untested consonant
- Position 5: A or untested consonant

But A cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and O cannot be in position 2 or 3. So possible placements:
- A must be in position 5.
- O must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try:
- If O is in position 1, then 2 and 4 need consonants.
- If O is in position 4, then 1 and 2 need consonants.

- O: allowed in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2 (from TONAL feedback). So O cannot be in position 2. So ""GONAD"" is invalid because O would be in position 2.

Let's try ""BONGO"" - but O would be in position 4 (allowed), N in 3, but G is new, but E is ruled out (no E here). But this has O in 4 and N in 3, but A is missing. We need A in 5.

""OPINA"" - but N is already in 3, so this would be O P I N A - but then O is in 1, P in 2, I in 4, N in 3, A in 5. This fits:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O
- We still need to find the correct positions for A and O, and identify the other three letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and O in new positions.
2. Avoid R, S, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Possible candidates: ADIEU (but E is out), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALONG (but G is less common), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALOUD (but D is less common).

""ADOPT"" is good: uses A and O in new positions, and introduces D, P, T (common letters). But P is less common than T.

""ALERT"" uses A and O (but O isn't in it), so skip.

""ADORN"" uses A and O, but R is out.

""ACORN"" uses A, O, C, N. C and N are common, and we haven't tested them yet.

""ACORN"" seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C  
Letters definitely IN the word (but still in wrong positions): A, O, N  

Current constraints:
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- O must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 2.
- N must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5.
- We still need three more letters, none of which can be R, S, E, C.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed).

A strong third guess should:
1. Place A, O, N in new, still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate words:
- OATEN – but E is already ruled out.
- ANTON – repeats N and T is untested, but O and N positions clash.
- PLANT – P and L are new, but P is less common.
- GONAD – G and D are new, but G is less common.
- HOARD – H and D are new, but H is less common.
- TONAL – T and L are new, and positions for A, O, N are all valid:
  – A is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T and L are new.

- A must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- O must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

The only remaining positions for A are 5, and for O are 1 or 4.

So the word looks like:
- Position 1: O or untested consonant
- Position 2: untested consonant
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O or untested consonant
- Position 5: A or untested consonant

But A cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and O cannot be in position 2 or 3. So possible placements:

- O must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try:

Wait, ""GONAD"" uses G, O, N, A, D - all allowed so far:
- G: new
- O: allowed in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2 (from TONAL feedback). So O cannot be in position 2. So ""GONAD"" is invalid because O would be in position 2.

""OPINA"" - but N is already in 3, so this would be O P I N A - but then O is in 1, P in 2, I in 4, N in 3, A in 5. This fits:

This seems like a good guess.Based on the feedback, N is locked in position 3, A must be in position 5, and O must be in position 1 or 4. The word must also avoid R, S, E, C, T, L. A valid word fitting these constraints is:

Let’s summarize the information we now have after four guesses.

Letters known NOT in the word  
R, S, E, C, T, L, I  (from the “x” feedback)

Letters known TO be in the word  
A, O, N  (all previously marked “-” or “✓” at least once)

Fixed positions  
- N is definitely in position 3 (from Guess 3 feedback: N(✓)).

Placements still uncertain  
- A must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (every spot has now shown “-” for A).  
  That is impossible: a 5-letter word cannot contain A and not contain A.  
  Therefore my earlier deduction that A must be in position 5 was incomplete.  
  Re-examining the feedback:

Guess 1 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 1  
Guess 2 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 1 (again)  
Guess 4 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 5  

So A must be in position 2 or 4.

- O must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from “-” feedback).  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5.

- P was tested in position 2 and got “P(-)”, so P is in the word but not in position 2.  
  Remaining legal positions for P: 1, 4, 5.

- We still need two more distinct letters (since the word is 5 letters and we have A, O, N, P so far).  
  They must come from the unused alphabet excluding the ruled-out set {R,S,E,C,T,L,I}.  
  Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Remaining vowels: U (only; A, O, E, I already handled).

A quick way to proceed is to enumerate the few possible patterns that satisfy:

1. N is in position 3.  
2. A is in position 2 or 4.  
3. O is in position 1 or 5.  
4. P is somewhere except position 2.  
5. Two additional letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try O in position 1 and A in position 2:

Pattern: O A N _ _

We still need two more letters, one of which must be P (since P is in the word).  
Possible placements for P: position 4 or 5.

- If P is in 4: O A N P _ → need one more letter in 5.  
  Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Try common ones: O A N P D → “OANPD” – not a word.  
  O A N P Y → “OANPY” – not a word.  
  O A N P K → “OANKY” – not a word.  
  None of these are valid English words.

- If P is in 5: O A N _ P → need one more letter in 4.  
  O A N B P – not a word.  
  O A N D P – not a word.  
  O A N G P – not a word.  
  O A N K P – not a word.  
  O A N M P – not a word.  
  O A N U P – “OANUP” – not a word.  
  O A N V P – not a word.  
  O A N Y P – not a word.  

Next pattern: O in position 5 and A in position 2:

Pattern: _ A N _ O

We still need two more letters, one of which must be P.  
P cannot be in position 2 (already A) and cannot be in position 2 again, so P can be in 1 or 4.

- If P is in 1: P A N _ O → need one letter in 4.  
  PAN_D, PAN_G, PAN_K, PAN_M, PAN_U, PAN_V, PAN_Y.  
  “PANDO” – not a word.  
  “PANJO” – but J is allowed, and “PANJO” is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).  
  Let’s check: P A N J O  
  – Contains A, O, N, P – all required.  
  – No ruled-out letters.  
  – Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), O is in 5 (allowed), P is in 1 (allowed), N is in 3 (fixed).  
  – The missing letter J is allowed.

Therefore “PANJO” satisfies every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, O
- We still need to find the correct positions for A and O, and identify the other three letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A and O in new positions.
2. Avoid R, S, E.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

Possible candidates: ADIEU (but E is out), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALONG (but G is less common), AUDIO (but U is repeated), ALOUD (but D is less common).

""ADOPT"" is good: uses A and O in new positions, and introduces D, P, T (common letters). But P is less common than T.

""ALERT"" uses A and O (but O isn't in it), so skip.

""ADORN"" uses A and O, but R is out.

""ACORN"" uses A, O, C, N. C and N are common, and we haven't tested them yet.

""ACORN"" seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C  
Letters definitely IN the word (but still in wrong positions): A, O, N  

Current constraints:
- A must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 2.
- O must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3 or 2.
- N must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5.
- We still need three more letters, none of which can be R, S, E, C.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to test: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed).

A strong third guess should:
1. Place A, O, N in new, still-allowed positions.
2. Introduce two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate words:
- OATEN – but E is already ruled out.
- ANTON – repeats N and T is untested, but O and N positions clash.
- PLANT – P and L are new, but P is less common.
- GONAD – G and D are new, but G is less common.
- HOARD – H and D are new, but H is less common.
- TONAL – T and L are new, and positions for A, O, N are all valid:
  – A is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (allowed), T and L are new.

“TONAL” fits all constraints.

From the three rounds we now have:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, T, L  
Letters definitely IN the word: N (position 3), A, O (both still in wrong positions)

Current constraints:
- N is locked in position 3.
- A must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- O must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

The only remaining positions for A are 5, and for O are 1 or 4.

So the word looks like:
- Position 1: O or untested consonant
- Position 2: untested consonant
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: O or untested consonant
- Position 5: A or untested consonant

But A cannot be in position 4 (from feedback), and O cannot be in position 2 or 3. So possible placements:
- A must be in position 5.
- O must be in position 1 or 4.

Let's try:
- If O is in position 1, then 2 and 4 need consonants.
- If O is in position 4, then 1 and 2 need consonants.

Remaining untested common consonants: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.

Let's pick a word that:
- Has N in position 3.
- Has A in position 5.
- Has O in position 1 or 4.
- Uses two new consonants.

Option 1: O _ N _ A
Option 2: _ _ N O A

Let's try ""DONNA"" - but N is repeated and we don't know if N appears twice.
Let's try ""PONCA"" - but C is already ruled out.
Let's try ""GONAD"" - but D is new, but L is already ruled out (wait, L is ruled out, but D is new).
Wait, ""GONAD"" uses G, O, N, A, D - all allowed so far:
- G: new
- O: allowed in position 2? But O cannot be in position 2 (from TONAL feedback). So O cannot be in position 2. So ""GONAD"" is invalid because O would be in position 2.

Let's try ""BONGO"" - but O would be in position 4 (allowed), N in 3, but G is new, but E is ruled out (no E here). But this has O in 4 and N in 3, but A is missing. We need A in 5.

Let's try ""PANDA"" - but D is new, but A is in 4 which is invalid (A cannot be in 4).
Let's try ""MANGO"" - O in 4 (allowed), A in 3 but N is already in 3. No.
Let's try ""FANJO"" - but J is less common and O in 5 is allowed, but A in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""VANHO"" - but H is new, O in 5 is allowed, A in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""BANJO"" - same issue with A in 2.

Let's try ""PANDA"" - A in 4 is invalid.
Let's try ""BONGO"" - missing A.
Let's try ""GONAD"" - O in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""PONDA"" - O in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""DONNA"" - O in 2 is invalid.

Alternative: O in position 4, then:
_ _ N O A

Possible word: ""HONEY"" - but E is ruled out.
""MONDA"" - D is new, but A in 4 is invalid.
""BOGNA"" - but G is new, A in 5 is ok, O in 2 is invalid.
""VOGNA"" - same issue.

Let's try ""PONCA"" - but C is ruled out.

Wait, let's systematically list possible positions:
Word structure: _ _ N _ _
A must be in 5 (only remaining spot).
O must be in 1 or 4.

Case 1: O in 1, then word is O _ N _ A
Need two consonants for positions 2 and 4, not yet used: D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, Y, W, V.

Possible: O D N G A - ""ODNGA"" - not a word.
O M N D A - ""OMNDA"" - not a word.
O P N D A - ""OPNDA"" - not a word.
O B N D A - ""OBNDA"" - not a word.

Case 2: O in 4, then word is _ _ N O A
Need two consonants for positions 1 and 2.
Possible: B U N O A - but U is new vowel, but we have no info on U.
B A N O A - but A in 2 is invalid.
P U N O A - ""PUNOA"" - not a word.
G U N O A - ""GUNOA"" - not a word.
D U N O A - ""DUNOA"" - not a word.

Let's try ""PANDA"" - but A in 4 is invalid.
Let's try ""BANJO"" - A in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""GONAD"" - O in 2 is invalid.

Wait, let's try ""PONCA"" - but C is ruled out.

Alternative: Maybe A is in 5, O is in 1, and we have:
O _ N _ A
Possible word: O B N D A - ""OBNDA"" - not valid.
O M N D A - ""OMNDA"" - not valid.
O P N D A - ""OPNDA"" - not valid.
O D N G A - ""ODNGA"" - not valid.

This seems problematic. Maybe I missed other possibilities.

Wait, let's try ""PANJO"" - but J is less common and A in 2 is invalid.
Let's try ""BANJO"" - same issue.

Alternative: Maybe O is in 4, and word is _ _ N O A
Possible word: ""BUNOA"" - not valid.
""FUNOA"" - not valid.
""MONOA"" - not valid.

Let me think differently: Maybe the word has A in 5, O in 1, and two consonants in 2 and 4.
Possible valid word: ""OPINA"" - but I is new vowel, P is new consonant.
""OPINA"" - but N is already in 3, so this would be O P I N A - but then O is in 1, P in 2, I in 4, N in 3, A in 5. This fits:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- P new
- I new
- N in 3 (correct)
- A in 5 (correct)
And no ruled-out letters.

""OPINA"" is a valid 5-letter word (a variant of ""opine"" or related to ""opine"").

But let's check if this uses any ruled-out letters: R, S, E, C, T, L - none are used. P, I, O, N, A are all allowed.

This seems like a good guess.Based on the feedback, N is locked in position 3, A must be in position 5, and O must be in position 1 or 4. The word must also avoid R, S, E, C, T, L. A valid word fitting these constraints is:

Let’s summarize the information we now have after four guesses.

Letters known NOT in the word  
R, S, E, C, T, L, I  (from the “x” feedback)

Letters known TO be in the word  
A, O, N  (all previously marked “-” or “✓” at least once)

Fixed positions  
- N is definitely in position 3 (from Guess 3 feedback: N(✓)).

Placements still uncertain  
- A must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (every spot has now shown “-” for A).  
  That is impossible: a 5-letter word cannot contain A and not contain A.  
  Therefore my earlier deduction that A must be in position 5 was incomplete.  
  Re-examining the feedback:

Guess 1 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 1  
Guess 2 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 1 (again)  
Guess 4 A(-)  → A is in word, not in position 5  

So A must be in position 2 or 4.

- O must appear somewhere, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from “-” feedback).  
  Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5.

- P was tested in position 2 and got “P(-)”, so P is in the word but not in position 2.  
  Remaining legal positions for P: 1, 4, 5.

- We still need two more distinct letters (since the word is 5 letters and we have A, O, N, P so far).  
  They must come from the unused alphabet excluding the ruled-out set {R,S,E,C,T,L,I}.  
  Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Remaining vowels: U (only; A, O, E, I already handled).

A quick way to proceed is to enumerate the few possible patterns that satisfy:

1. N is in position 3.  
2. A is in position 2 or 4.  
3. O is in position 1 or 5.  
4. P is somewhere except position 2.  
5. Two additional letters from the allowed set.

Let’s try O in position 1 and A in position 2:

Pattern: O A N _ _

We still need two more letters, one of which must be P (since P is in the word).  
Possible placements for P: position 4 or 5.

- If P is in 4: O A N P _ → need one more letter in 5.  
  Allowed letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Try common ones: O A N P D → “OANPD” – not a word.  
  O A N P Y → “OANPY” – not a word.  
  O A N P K → “OANKY” – not a word.  
  None of these are valid English words.

- If P is in 5: O A N _ P → need one more letter in 4.  
  O A N B P – not a word.  
  O A N D P – not a word.  
  O A N G P – not a word.  
  O A N K P – not a word.  
  O A N M P – not a word.  
  O A N U P – “OANUP” – not a word.  
  O A N V P – not a word.  
  O A N Y P – not a word.  

Next pattern: O in position 5 and A in position 2:

Pattern: _ A N _ O

We still need two more letters, one of which must be P.  
P cannot be in position 2 (already A) and cannot be in position 2 again, so P can be in 1 or 4.

- If P is in 1: P A N _ O → need one letter in 4.  
  PAN_D, PAN_G, PAN_K, PAN_M, PAN_U, PAN_V, PAN_Y.  
  “PANDO” – not a word.  
  “PANJO” – but J is allowed, and “PANJO” is a valid word (a type of musical instrument).  
  Let’s check: P A N J O  
  – Contains A, O, N, P – all required.  
  – No ruled-out letters.  
  – Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), O is in 5 (allowed), P is in 1 (allowed), N is in 3 (fixed).  
  – The missing letter J is allowed.

Therefore “PANJO” satisfies every constraint.

So the word is now fully determined except for position 4. We know:
- Letters already placed: P, A, N, O.
- The missing letter (position 4) must be a consonant not yet ruled out and not already used (no repeats unless the letter appears twice, which is allowed but unlikely here).
- Ruled-out letters so far: R, S, E, C, T, L, I, J.
- Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a common 5-letter word that fits P A N _ O. The only common word is ""PANDO"" (though it's rare) or ""PANFO"" (not a word). However, ""PANFO"" isn't valid, but ""PANDO"" is a valid though uncommon word. Checking again, the more common word is actually ""PANDA"" but we've considered that. However, ""PANDA"" would have D in position 4, which hasn't been ruled out. Let me check if ""PANDA"" fits all constraints:
- P A N D A: letters P, A, N, D, A.
- D hasn't been used or ruled out.
- It uses A twice, which is allowed.
- All letters are allowed.

Thus, the word must be ""PANDA"".
