For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses none of the letters A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places S in a new position. A solid choice is ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N, G are all unused letters that are fairly common.
- Contains no A, R, O, E.

This should give us more information about which letters are present/absent and where S might sit.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S and I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from STING).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STING).

So the remaining candidate letters are: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters S and I.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I.
2. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Places I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces a couple of new common letters to maximize information gain. A good candidate is “SPILL”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So SPILL is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLIMY”
- S in position 1 → again invalid for the same reason.

- S in positions 1 and 4 → position 4 is invalid for S.

Candidate: “ISSUE”

Candidate: “LISPS”
- S in position 5 (valid), I in position 2 (valid), L in position 1 (new), P in position 4 (new). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- Letters used: L, I, S, P, S → contains S (positions 2 and 5), I (position 2), and no forbidden letters.
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses none of the letters A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places S in a new position. A solid choice is ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N, G are all unused letters that are fairly common.
- Contains no A, R, O, E.

This should give us more information about which letters are present/absent and where S might sit.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S and I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from STING).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STING).

So the remaining candidate letters are: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters S and I.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I.
2. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Places I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces a couple of new common letters to maximize information gain. A good candidate is “SPILL”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So SPILL is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLIMY”
- S in position 1 → again invalid for the same reason.

Candidate: “SHIFT”
- S in position 1 → invalid.

Candidate: “SWISH”
- S in position 1 and 5 → invalid.

Candidate: “SUSHI”
- S in positions 1 and 4 → position 4 is invalid for S.

Candidate: “ISSUE”
- S in position 2 (valid), I in positions 1 and 3 → position 3 is invalid for I.

Candidate: “LISPS”
- S in position 5 (valid), I in position 2 (valid), L in position 1 (new), P in position 4 (new). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- Letters used: L, I, S, P, S → contains S (positions 2 and 5), I (position 2), and no forbidden letters.
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

This gives us new letters L and P to test while respecting all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some popular choices include words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Uses none of the letters A, R, O, E.

Good remaining consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining letters and places S in a new position. A solid choice is ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N, G are all unused letters that are fairly common.
- Contains no A, R, O, E.

This should give us more information about which letters are present/absent and where S might sit.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S and I  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from STING).
- I cannot be in position 3 (from STING).

So the remaining candidate letters are: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters S and I.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and I.
2. Places S in positions 2, 3, or 5.
3. Places I in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces a couple of new common letters to maximize information gain. A good candidate is “SPILL”:
- S is in position 1 → but we already know S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback). So SPILL is invalid.

Next candidate: “SLIMY”
- S in position 1 → again invalid for the same reason.

Candidate: “SHIFT”
- S in position 1 → invalid.

Candidate: “SWISH”
- S in position 1 and 5 → invalid.

Candidate: “SUSHI”
- S in positions 1 and 4 → position 4 is invalid for S.

Candidate: “ISSUE”
- S in position 2 (valid), I in positions 1 and 3 → position 3 is invalid for I.

Candidate: “LISPS”
- S in position 5 (valid), I in position 2 (valid), L in position 1 (new), P in position 4 (new). This seems valid.

Let’s check:
- Letters used: L, I, S, P, S → contains S (positions 2 and 5), I (position 2), and no forbidden letters.
- S is in positions 2 and 5 (both allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).

This gives us new letters L and P to test while respecting all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: LISPS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(-) S(-) P(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from LISPS:

Letters we now know are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, L

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (-):
I and S (the second S in LISPS is now marked ✓, so S is in position 5 and correct)

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5 ✓)
- Contains I somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 allowed)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N, G, L
- Does contain S (position 5) and I (somewhere else)

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S
2. Contains I somewhere in positions 1-4
3. Uses only the allowed letters

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, or 4
Possible positions for S: only 5 (already confirmed)

Let's look for words ending in S with I in positions 1-4 and no forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BISQS (invalid, Q is allowed but not common)
- CISPS (uses P twice, but P is allowed)
- DISKS (uses K, allowed)
- FISTS (uses F, I, S, T - but T is forbidden)
- HISKS (invalid)
- MISTS (uses M, I, S, T - T is forbidden)
- PIVKS (invalid)
- WISPS (uses W, I, S, P - all allowed)

""WISPS"" seems valid:
- Ends with S (position 5 ✓)
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses W, I, S, P - all allowed letters
- No forbidden lettersBased on the latest feedback, the word ends with S and contains I in positions 1-4. The letters W, I, S, P are all allowed.

From the four rounds we have:

Letters known NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, N, G, L, W

Letters known TO be in the word (✓ or -):
- S is in position 5 (✓ from LISPS and WISPS)
- I is somewhere in positions 1-4 (it has been ""-"" in positions 2 and 3, so it can’t be 2 or 3; possible positions 1 or 4)

Remaining candidate letters (unused and not ruled out):
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S (position 5)
2. Contains I in position 1 or 4
3. Uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list possible patterns:
- I _ _ _ S (I in position 1)
- _ _ _ I S (I in position 4)

Looking for valid words fitting these patterns with allowed letters:

Pattern I _ _ _ S:
- I B I S S – invalid (repeated S and I not allowed)
- I C I S S – invalid
- I M I S S – invalid
- I F I S S – invalid
- I D I S S – invalid
- I C H S – too short
- I C K S – too short
- I C K S – no valid word

Pattern _ _ _ I S:
- B U I S S – invalid
- C H I S – too short
- D I C K S – valid word, uses D, I, C, K, S
- F I V E S – uses E (forbidden)
- H I D D S – uses D twice, but D is allowed
- M I C K S – valid word, uses M, I, C, K, S

Between ""DICKS"" and ""MICKS"", both are valid. ""DICKS"" uses D, I, C, K, S while ""MICKS"" uses M, I, C, K, S. Both fit constraints. Let’s pick ""DICKS"" first as it tests D.

“HI…”.

It seems every valid 5-letter word ending in S with I in position 1 or 4 is either too short or uses forbidden letters. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possible words.

Allowed letters: B, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Pattern _ _ _ I S:
- B U _ I S: “BUISS” invalid.
- B H _ I S: “BHIS” too short.
- B P _ I S: “BPIS” too short.
- B M _ I S: “BMIS” too short.

- Y F _ I S: “YFIS” too short.

“FUMIS” – uses U (allowed), M (allowed), I (allowed), S (allowed), but F is allowed.
- F U M I S – positions: I is in position 4 (allowed), S in 5 (allowed), no forbidden letters.

This fits all constraints:
- Ends with S.
- I is in position 4.
- Uses F, U, M, I, S – all allowed letters.

Therefore, the correct guess is FUMIS.
</think>

<guess>FUMIS</guess>",FUMIS,"Current knowledge:

- Position 5 is S (✓).
- I is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from WISPS and DICKS feedback).
  Therefore I must be in position 1 or 4.
- Letters ruled out so far (x): A, R, O, E, T, N, G, L, W, D, C, K.
- Remaining candidate letters: B, F, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S with I in position 1 or 4 using only the remaining letters.

Pattern 1: I _ _ _ S
- I B _ _ S: “IBIS” is 4 letters, “IBISS” invalid (double S not allowed).
- I F _ _ S: “IFIS” invalid.
- I M _ _ S: “IMISS” invalid.
- I B B S – invalid.
- No valid 5-letter words here.

Pattern 2: _ _ _ I S
- B U _ I S: “BUISS” invalid.
- B H _ I S: “BHIS” too short.
- M U _ I S: “MUIS” too short.
- F U _ I S: “FUIS” too short.
- H U _ I S: “HUIS” too short.
- M I C I S – uses C (forbidden).
- M I S T S – uses T (forbidden).
- M I S S – too short.
- B I S S – too short.
- P I S S – too short.
- J I S S – too short.
- M I S S – again too short.

Wait, we have missed a simple word: “MISYS” – but Y is allowed and it fits:
- M I S Y S – but double S is not allowed.
- “FISHS” – uses H (allowed), F (allowed), I (allowed), S (allowed), ends with S.
  Check positions: I is in position 3 (but we know I cannot be in position 3 from WISPS feedback). So invalid.

“HISSY” – ends with Y, not S.

“PISKS” – uses K (forbidden).

“MISKS” – uses K (forbidden).

“FISKS” – uses K (forbidden).

“BISQS” – uses Q (allowed), but B, I, S, Q, S – double S invalid.

“MIMIS” – uses M twice, but I is in position 3 (invalid).

“FIFIS” – uses F twice, I in position 3 (invalid).

“JIMIS” – I in position 3 (invalid).

“VIMIS” – I in position 3 (invalid).

“BIBIS” – I in position 3 (invalid).

“MIMIS” – again I in position 3.

“HISYS” – uses Y (allowed), H (allowed), I (allowed), S (allowed), ends with S.
  Positions: I is in position 3 (invalid).

“FIBIS” – I in position 3 (invalid).

“MIFIS” – I in position 3 (invalid).

“PIMPS” – uses P, I, M, P, S – P twice allowed, I in position 3 (invalid).

“MISYS” – again too short or invalid.

“FISYS” – too short.

“BISYS” – too short.

“HISYS” – too short.

“MISYS” – too short.
