For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

and it must contain R somewhere in positions 2-5.

Next, I want to test new consonants and see if R is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5. I’ll pick a word that keeps A in place, moves R to a new spot, and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “ABORT”:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Moves R to position 3.
- Tests B, O (but we already know O is out), and T.
However, O is already ruled out, so let’s avoid it. Instead, I’ll use “ABRIS”:
- A stays in place.
- R is in position 2 (a new spot).
- Tests B, I (new vowel), and S (but S was already tested and marked x). Oops, S is out.

Let me try “ABRUT”:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, U, T. But U is less common than I.

A better choice might be “ACRID”:
- A stays.
- R moves to position 2.
- Tests C, I, D. All new letters.

But to maximize information, I’ll go with “ABRIS” but swap S for T: “ABRIT” (though “ABRIT” isn’t a valid word). The valid word “ABRID” is better:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, I, D.

Actually, let’s use “ACRID” for the vowel I and consonants C, R, D.

Wait, let’s pick “ACRID”:
A(✓) C _ R _ I _ D. But we need 5-letter words.

Let me choose “ACRID”:
A C R I D – but R is in position 3, which is new.

But to keep it simple and common, let’s use “ABRID”:
A B R I D – valid word, tests B, R in position 3, I, D.

Yes, this seems good.

So far we know:
- The word starts with A (position 1 is fixed).
- R is in the word and is now known to be in position 3 (from ABRID feedback: R(✓) in position 3).
- Letters O, S, E, B, I, D are NOT in the word.

Current pattern: A _ R _ _

We still need to test positions 2 and 4-5. We have not yet tested C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 1 and R in position 3.
2. Introduce new consonants for positions 2, 4, 5.
3. Prefer common letters.

Possible candidates: 
- A C R U N
- A F R A I (but I is out)
- A C R U T
- A M R I T (I is out)
- A C R O N (O is out)
- A C R U S (S is out)
- A C R U B (B is out)
- A C R U N (valid word)

Let me pick ""ACRUN"" – but that's not a valid English word.

Valid words fitting A _ R _ _:
- ACRID (I and D already ruled out)
- AFAR (too short)
- AFRICA (too long)
- AROSE (already used)
- AUROR (O is out)
- AUROR (O is out)
- AUROR (O is out)

- ACRID
- ACORN (O is out)
- AFRON (not valid)
- AUROR (O is out)
- AUROR (O is out)

Hmm, seems like most common ones have O or I or D. Let's try to make a word with new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

and it must contain R somewhere in positions 2-5.

Next, I want to test new consonants and see if R is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5. I’ll pick a word that keeps A in place, moves R to a new spot, and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “ABORT”:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Moves R to position 3.
- Tests B, O (but we already know O is out), and T.
However, O is already ruled out, so let’s avoid it. Instead, I’ll use “ABRIS”:
- A stays in place.
- R is in position 2 (a new spot).
- Tests B, I (new vowel), and S (but S was already tested and marked x). Oops, S is out.

Let me try “ABRUT”:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, U, T. But U is less common than I.

A better choice might be “ACRID”:
- A stays.
- R moves to position 2.
- Tests C, I, D. All new letters.

But to maximize information, I’ll go with “ABRIS” but swap S for T: “ABRIT” (though “ABRIT” isn’t a valid word). The valid word “ABRID” is better:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, I, D.

Actually, let’s use “ACRID” for the vowel I and consonants C, R, D.

Wait, let’s pick “ACRID”:
A(✓) C _ R _ I _ D. But we need 5-letter words.

Let me choose “ACRID”:
A C R I D – but R is in position 3, which is new.

But to keep it simple and common, let’s use “ABRID”:
A B R I D – valid word, tests B, R in position 3, I, D.

Yes, this seems good.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - O, S, E are not in the word

   - A is correct in position 1 (confirmed)
   - B is not in the word
   - R is correct in position 3
   - I is not in the word
   - D is not in the word

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ R _ _
- Letters to avoid: O, S, E, B, I, D
- Letters already confirmed: A, R
- Remaining positions (2 and 4-5) need to be filled with letters not yet tested or ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Common remaining vowels: U (since A is used, and we've ruled out O, I, E)

Let's try a word that fits A _ R _ _ and uses new letters. A good candidate is ""ACORN"" but O is ruled out. ""AFRAN"" is not a word. ""ARCAN"" is not common. ""AROMA"" has O. ""ARGOT"" has O. ""ARTSY"" has S. ""ARTIC"" has I. 

Looking for valid words: ""ACRID"" was tried but I and D are out. ""ACORN"" is invalid (O). ""AFIRE"" has I and E. ""AGLOW"" has O. 

Wait, let's think systematically. We need A _ R _ _. Valid words with these constraints:
- A C R _ _ : like ""ACORN"" (invalid), ""ACRID"" (invalid), ""ACRIM"" (not a word)
- A F R _ _ : ""AFIRE"" (invalid I and E)
- A G R _ _ : ""AGRIT"" (invalid I)
- A H R _ _ : ""AHEAD"" (invalid E)
- A L R _ _ : ""ALARM"" (invalid M and E)
- A M R _ _ : ""AMBER"" (invalid B, E)
- A N R _ _ : ""ANGRY"" (invalid Y)
- A P R _ _ : ""APART"" (invalid P, A, R, T - but A and R are correct)
- A T R _ _ : ""ATTIC"" (invalid I, C)
- A U R _ _ : ""AUROR"" (invalid O)
- A W R _ _ : ""AWAKE"" (invalid K, E)

Hmm, most common words either have ruled-out letters or are not fitting. Let's try ""ACORN"" but O is out. ""AROMA"" has O. 

Wait, let's try ""ACRNY"" but that's not a word. 

Looking at remaining letters: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, W, Y

Possible combinations:
- A C R U T: ""ACRUT"" (invalid)
- A C R U N: ""ACRUN"" (invalid)
- A F R U N: ""AFRUN"" (invalid)
- A G R U N: ""AGRUN"" (invalid)

- A U R U N: ""AURUN"" (invalid)
- A W R U N: ""AWRUN"" (invalid)
- A Y R U N: ""AYRUN"" (invalid)

This seems problematic. Maybe we need to consider that position 5 could be a consonant. Let's try ""ACORN"" but O is out. 

Wait, let's try ""ACRID"" but I and D are out. 

Alternative approach: Maybe the word is ""AUGUR"" but that's 5 letters and has U, G, but we haven't tested G or U yet. 

""AUGUR"" fits A _ R _ _:
- A(✓)
- U (new)
- R(✓)
- G (new)
- U (new)

But we need to check if ""AUGUR"" is a valid word - it's a historical term for a prophet, so it's valid.

Let's try ""AUGUR"":
A(✓) U G R - but we need 5 letters. ""AUGUR"" is 5 letters: A U G U R.

But this would place R in position 5, which hasn't been tested yet. 

Another option: ""AUROR"" but O is out. 

""AUROR"" is invalid (O). 

""ACORN"" is invalid (O). 

""ACRID"" is invalid (I, D). 

""AFIRE"" is invalid (I, E). 

""AGLOW"" is invalid (O).

""ATRIC"" is invalid (I). 

""ATRUM"" is invalid (U, M). 

""AURUM"" is invalid (O, U). 

""AUGUR"" seems to be the best remaining option with new letters U and G.

But let's verify ""AUGUR"" is a valid 5-letter word - yes, it's listed in dictionaries as an ancient Roman prophet.

Thus, the next guess should be ""AUGUR"" to test U and G in positions 2 and 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Covers 5 distinct letters

This gives me maximum information about the presence/absence of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
A _ _ _ _

and it must contain R somewhere in positions 2-5.

Next, I want to test new consonants and see if R is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5. I’ll pick a word that keeps A in place, moves R to a new spot, and introduces other common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is “ABORT”:
- Keeps A in position 1.
- Moves R to position 3.
- Tests B, O (but we already know O is out), and T.
However, O is already ruled out, so let’s avoid it. Instead, I’ll use “ABRIS”:
- A stays in place.
- R is in position 2 (a new spot).
- Tests B, I (new vowel), and S (but S was already tested and marked x). Oops, S is out.

Let me try “ABRUT”:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, U, T. But U is less common than I.

A better choice might be “ACRID”:
- A stays.
- R moves to position 2.
- Tests C, I, D. All new letters.

But to maximize information, I’ll go with “ABRIS” but swap S for T: “ABRIT” (though “ABRIT” isn’t a valid word). The valid word “ABRID” is better:
- A, R in new positions.
- Tests B, I, D.

Actually, let’s use “ACRID” for the vowel I and consonants C, R, D.

Wait, let’s pick “ACRID”:
A(✓) C _ R _ I _ D. But we need 5-letter words.

Let me choose “ACRID”:
A C R I D – but R is in position 3, which is new.

But to keep it simple and common, let’s use “ABRID”:
A B R I D – valid word, tests B, R in position 3, I, D.

Yes, this seems good.

A good candidate is “ABORT”:\n- Keeps A in position 1.\n- Moves R to position 3.\n- Tests B, O (but we already know O is out), and T.\nHowever, O is already ruled out, so let’s avoid it. Instead, I’ll use “ABRIS”:\n- A stays in place.\n- R is in position 2 (a new spot).\n- Tests B, I (new vowel), and S (but S was already tested and marked x). Oops, S is out.\n\nLet me try “ABRUT”:\n- A, R in new positions.\n- Tests B, U, T. But U is less common than I.\n\nA better choice might be “ACRID”:\n- A stays.\n- R moves to position 2.\n- Tests C, I, D. All new letters.\n\nBut to maximize information, I’ll go with “ABRIS” but swap S for T: “ABRIT” (though “ABRIT” isn’t a valid word). The valid word “ABRID” is better:\n- A, R in new positions.\n- Tests B, I, D.\n\nActually, let’s use “ACRID” for the vowel I and consonants C, R, D.\n\nWait, let’s pick “ACRID”:\nA(✓) C _ R _ I _ D. But we need 5-letter words.\n\nLet me choose “ACRID”:\nA C R I D – but R is in position 3, which is new.\n\nBut to keep it simple and common, let’s use “ABRID”:\nA B R I D – valid word, tests B, R in position 3, I, D.\n\nYes, this seems good.\n\n<guess>ABRID</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABRID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\n1.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ A is fixed in position 1.  
   ⇒ R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (because it was “-” in both AROSE and AUGUR).  
   ⇒ O, S, E are completely absent.

2. ABRID → A(✓) B(x) R(✓) I(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ R is fixed in position 3.  
   ⇒ B, I, D are absent.

3. AUGUR → A(✓) U(✓) G(x) U(✓) R(-)  
   ⇒ U is in the word and already in the correct spot (position 2).  
   ⇒ G is not in the word.  
   ⇒ The final U(✓) confirms U is in position 4 as well?  
     Wait: the feedback symbols are per-position only.  
     Position 1: A(✓) – correct.  
     Position 2: U(✓) – correct.  
     Position 3: G(x) – G not in word.  
     Position 4: U(✓) – correct.  
     Position 5: R(-) – R is in word but not here.

So the confirmed pattern is:  
A U R _ _   (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

But position 5 must NOT be R (from R(-) in AUGUR), and we already have R fixed in position 3.  
Therefore the word is A U R _ _ with R already in place at 3, and positions 4 and 5 still open.

Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, B, I, D, G.

Remaining common letters: C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, and the only vowel left is Y (sometimes used as vowel).

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set.

Possible valid 5-letter words fitting A U R _ _:
- AUROR – invalid (O)
- AURAS – S is out
- AURIC – C is allowed
- AUROR – invalid
- AURUM – M is allowed
- AURIC or AURUM seem best.

Let’s test AURIC:
A U R I C – but I was ruled out in ABRID, so I is invalid.

Next, AURUM:
A U R U M – the second U is already in position 2, so position 4 would need another U, which is allowed (letters can repeat unless ruled out).  
M has not been tested or ruled out yet.

Thus, the only remaining strong candidate is AURUM.

Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, B, I, D, G.

Remaining common letters: C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, and the only vowel left is Y (sometimes used as vowel).

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set.

Possible valid 5-letter words fitting A U R _ _:
- AUROR – invalid (O)
- AURAS – S is out
- AURIC – C is allowed
- AUROR – invalid
- AURUM – M is allowed
- AURIC or AURUM seem best.

Let’s test AURIC:
A U R I C – but I was ruled out in ABRID, so I is invalid.

Next, AURUM:
A U R U M – the second U is already in position 2, so position 4 would need another U, which is allowed (letters can repeat unless ruled out).  
M has not been tested or ruled out yet.

Thus, the only remaining strong candidate is AURUM.
