### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word with very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers both common vowels and consonants.

From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → all letters x (so S, L, A, T, E are not in the word at all)
- IRONY → I(-) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- Y is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R and O are not in the word (x).
- S, L, A, T, E are also not in the word from the first guess.

So the secret word:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains I and N somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, A, T, E.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (plus I and N).

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y, with I and N somewhere in positions 2-3 or 3-4.

Possible patterns:
- _ I N _ Y
- _ N I _ Y
- _ _ I N Y
- _ _ N I Y
- etc., ensuring I and N are not in positions 1 or 4.

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns. Some possibilities:
- PICKY (P, I, C, K, Y) – but this has I in position 2 and N missing.
- MINCY (M, I, N, C, Y) – I in 2, N in 3, uses C (new letter).
- WINCY (W, I, N, C, Y) – same as above with W.
- PINCY – same as MINCY but P in 1.

MINCY seems good: uses I in 2, N in 3, C in 4, Y in 5, and M in 1 (all new letters).

Let’s verify:
- M, I, N, C, Y – none of these were marked x, and it fits the constraints.
- I is not in position 1 (ok, it’s in 2).
- N is not in position 4 (it’s in 3).
- Ends with Y.
- No R, O, S, L, A, T, E.

So MINCY is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word with very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers both common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) were marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

Next, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely different letters—ideally common consonants and vowels that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates:  
- IRONY (I, R, O, N, Y)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K)  

I’ll go with “IRONY” because it covers three new vowels (I, O, Y) and two common consonants (R, N) that haven’t been tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: IRONY -> FEEDBACK: I(-) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

- SLATE → all letters x (so S, L, A, T, E are not in the word at all)
- IRONY → I(-) R(x) O(x) N(-) Y(✓)

Interpretation:
- Y is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R and O are not in the word (x).
- S, L, A, T, E are also not in the word from the first guess.

So the secret word:
- Ends with Y.
- Contains I and N somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, A, T, E.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (plus I and N).

We need a 5-letter word ending in Y, with I and N somewhere in positions 2-3 or 3-4.

Possible patterns:
- _ I N _ Y
- _ N I _ Y
- _ _ I N Y
- _ _ N I Y
- etc., ensuring I and N are not in positions 1 or 4.

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns. Some possibilities:
- PICKY (P, I, C, K, Y) – but this has I in position 2 and N missing.
- MINCY (M, I, N, C, Y) – I in 2, N in 3, uses C (new letter).
- WINCY (W, I, N, C, Y) – same as above with W.
- PINCY – same as MINCY but P in 1.

MINCY seems good: uses I in 2, N in 3, C in 4, Y in 5, and M in 1 (all new letters).

Let’s verify:
- M, I, N, C, Y – none of these were marked x, and it fits the constraints.
- I is not in position 1 (ok, it’s in 2).
- N is not in position 4 (it’s in 3).
- Ends with Y.
- No R, O, S, L, A, T, E.

So MINCY is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback:

NIPPY → N(✓) I(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

This tells us:
- N is correct in position 1
- I is correct in position 2
- Y is correct in position 5
- P is not in the word at all (both P's are marked x)

So the word pattern is now:
N I _ _ Y

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, M, C, P

Remaining possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with N I, ends with Y, and uses only these remaining letters in the middle two positions.

Possible combinations:
- N I B B Y → NIBBY (valid word)
- N I D D Y → NIDDY (valid but uncommon)
- N I F F Y → NIFFY (valid but uncommon)
- N I G G Y → NIGGY (slang, questionable)
- N I H H Y → NIHHY (invalid)
- N I K K Y → NIKKY (valid but uncommon)
- N I V V Y → NIVVY (valid but uncommon)
- N I W W Y → NIWWY (invalid)
- N I Z Z Y → NIZZY (valid but uncommon)

The most common and valid word here is NIBBY.

Check:
- N I B B Y
- Uses only allowed letters (B is not eliminated)
- Matches the pattern N I _ _ Y
- All letters are from the allowed set
