### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- AUDIO

These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities. I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in 5-letter words.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters in the word: S, E, I, N  
Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, H  

Positions ruled out so far:
- S is not in position 1 (from both guesses).
- E is not in position 5 (from SLATE) and not in position 5 again (from SHINE), so E must be in positions 1-4.
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (from SHINE).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (from SHINE).

So the mystery word is a 5-letter string that:
- Contains S, E, I, N exactly once each (since duplicates would have shown different feedback).
- Does not contain L, A, T, H.
- S is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.
- I is not in position 3.
- N is not in position 4.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Uses all four known letters (S, E, I, N) plus one new letter.
2. Places the known letters in positions that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Introduces a new common letter to test.

The only common 5-letter word that fits these constraints is “INSEN” (though that’s not a valid English word). Rearranging gives “SINCE”:
- S in position 1 (but we know S can’t be in position 1) – so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “SENIN” – invalid.  
“NINES” – S is in position 5 (allowed), E in position 2, I in position 3 (but I can’t be in 3) – invalid.

“NEISS” – S in 4, E in 2, I in 3 (invalid) – no.

“SNIPE” – introduces P, and positions:
- S in 1 (invalid), so discard.

“SPINE” – S in 1 (invalid).

“SENOR” – introduces R, but O is untested.  
“SENOR” has S in 1 (invalid).

“SINER” – S in 1 (invalid).

“NISER” – S in 4, E in 5 (invalid), I in 2 (ok), N in 1 (ok).

From the new feedback on NISER:
- N is in the word but not in position 1.
- I is in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the correct position (position 4).
- R is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Letters in the word: N, S, R (plus the already placed I, E)
- Letters not in the word: L, A, T, H

The word structure is: _ I _ E _

We need to place S, N, R into positions 1, 3, 5, respecting the exclusions:
- S cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from SLATE and NISER feedback).
- N cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from SHINE and NISER feedback).
- R cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions:
- S can only be in position 5 (but 5 is already excluded for S in NISER feedback).
Wait, let's re-examine:

From SLATE: S is in word but not position 1.
From SHINE: S is in word but not position 1 (again).
From NISER: S is in word but not position 3.
So S can be in positions 2, 4, 5. But 2 and 4 are already taken by I and E. Thus S must be in position 5.

From NISER: N is in word but not position 1. So N can be in 3 or 5.
But 5 is now taken by S, so N must be in position 3.

From NISER: R is in word but not position 5. So R can be in 1.

Thus the word must be: R I N E S.

Let's check:
- R in 1: allowed (not excluded)
- I in 2: correct
- N in 3: allowed (not excluded)
- E in 4: correct
- S in 5: allowed (not excluded)

This fits all constraints. The word is ""RINES"".
