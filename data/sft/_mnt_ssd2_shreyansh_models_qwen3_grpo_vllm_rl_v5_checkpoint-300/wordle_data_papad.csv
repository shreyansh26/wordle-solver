For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers more unique vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven’t tried yet.

Good consonants to try next (since R, S are out) include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Vowels we haven’t tried yet (besides A) are I and U.

A balanced next guess should include A in a different position and test new letters.  
A word like “TAINT” uses A in position 2 and brings in T, I, N.  
Another option is “PLANT” (A in position 3, P, L, N, T).  
I’ll choose “PLANT” because it tests P, L, N, T plus A in position 3.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the correct position (position 1).
   - L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (not in positions 1 or 3), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to pick a word that places A in position 2 and tests new consonants. A good candidate is ""PABUK"" (but K is less common). Another option is ""PAINT"" but T is already excluded. ""PAVID"" (but V and D are less common). 

A better choice is ""PACED"" but E and D are already excluded/allowed? Wait, E is excluded, D is allowed. But ""PACED"" has E which is excluded. 

Looking for words starting with P, containing A, avoiding R,O,S,E,L,N,T. 

""PAVED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.
""PAINT"" - T is excluded.
""PAKED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.

Alternative: ""PAMID"" - but M, I, D are allowed. However, ""PAMID"" is not a common word.

Another approach: use ""PAVID"" - V and D are allowed, but ""PAVID"" means full of energy, which is a bit obscure.

A more common word: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

Wait, let’s list possible letters:
Allowed letters: A, P (already used), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word starting with P, with A not in positions 1 or 3.

Let’s try ""PAVID"" - positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), D(5). This uses new letters V, I, D. 

""PAVID"" seems reasonable.

But to be more common, let’s try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Another option: ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best among less common words. Alternatively, ""PAKID"" - but K, I, D are allowed, but ""PAKID"" is not a word.

Another angle: use A in position 4 or 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - but B, I, C are allowed, and A is in position 4. But C is allowed, I is allowed, B is allowed. However, ""PUBIC"" doesn't have A.

Wait, we need A in the word. So let’s try ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the only 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (in position 2), and using allowed letters.

But let me think of others: ""PABUK"" - but K is allowed, B, U are allowed. ""PABUK"" is a word (a type of bread in some countries).

""PABUK"" - positions: P(1), A(2), B(3), U(4), K(5). This uses B, U, K which are allowed.

Between ""PAVID"" and ""PABUK"", ""PABUK"" seems more like a valid word (even if obscure), but ""PAVID"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""PAVID"" as it tests V and D which are new letters.

But to be more common, let me try ""PAKID"" - no, not a word.

Another option: ""PACID"" - but C, I, D are allowed. ""PACID"" is not a word.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best available.

Wait, let me think of ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" is the only viable option.

But ""PAVID"" is a bit obscure. Let me try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Actually, ""PAWED"" has E which is excluded.

Let me try ""PAKID"" - not a word.

Another approach: use A in position 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - no A.

""PUCKA"" - but C, K, A are allowed, and A is in position 5. ""PUCKA"" is a word (slang for puck).

""PUC"" + ""KA"" - but ""PUCKA"" is 5 letters: P, U, C, K, A.

This seems valid.

""PUCKA"" - positions: P(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), A(5).

This tests U, C, K, and places A in position 5.

This seems better than ""PAVID"" as it tests more new letters (U, C, K) and places A in position 5.

I'll go with ""PUCKA"".

But to be sure, let me check: P is correct in position 1. The word is P _ _ _ A, with no R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Letters used in ""PUCKA"": P, U, C, K, A. All allowed.

""PUCKA"" is a valid word (slang for puck, a piece of ice hockey equipment).

Thus, the next guess is ""PUCKA"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers more unique vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with letters we haven’t tried yet.

Good consonants to try next (since R, S are out) include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Vowels we haven’t tried yet (besides A) are I and U.

A balanced next guess should include A in a different position and test new letters.  
A word like “TAINT” uses A in position 2 and brings in T, I, N.  
Another option is “PLANT” (A in position 3, P, L, N, T).  
I’ll choose “PLANT” because it tests P, L, N, T plus A in position 3.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the correct position (position 1).
   - L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (not in positions 1 or 3), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to pick a word that places A in position 2 and tests new consonants. A good candidate is ""PABUK"" (but K is less common). Another option is ""PAINT"" but T is already excluded. ""PAVID"" (but V and D are less common). 

A better choice is ""PACED"" but E and D are already excluded/allowed? Wait, E is excluded, D is allowed. But ""PACED"" has E which is excluded. 

Looking for words starting with P, containing A, avoiding R,O,S,E,L,N,T. 

""PAVED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.
""PAINT"" - T is excluded.
""PAKED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.

Alternative: ""PAMID"" - but M, I, D are allowed. However, ""PAMID"" is not a common word.

Another approach: use ""PAVID"" - V and D are allowed, but ""PAVID"" means full of energy, which is a bit obscure.

A more common word: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

Wait, let’s list possible letters:
Allowed letters: A, P (already used), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word starting with P, with A not in positions 1 or 3.

Let’s try ""PAVID"" - positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), D(5). This uses new letters V, I, D. 

""PAVID"" seems reasonable.

But to be more common, let’s try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Another option: ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best among less common words. Alternatively, ""PAKID"" - but K, I, D are allowed, but ""PAKID"" is not a word.

Another angle: use A in position 4 or 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - but B, I, C are allowed, and A is in position 4. But C is allowed, I is allowed, B is allowed. However, ""PUBIC"" doesn't have A.

Wait, we need A in the word. So let’s try ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the only 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (in position 2), and using allowed letters.

But let me think of others: ""PABUK"" - but K is allowed, B, U are allowed. ""PABUK"" is a word (a type of bread in some countries).

""PABUK"" - positions: P(1), A(2), B(3), U(4), K(5). This uses B, U, K which are allowed.

Between ""PAVID"" and ""PABUK"", ""PABUK"" seems more like a valid word (even if obscure), but ""PAVID"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""PAVID"" as it tests V and D which are new letters.

But to be more common, let me try ""PAKID"" - no, not a word.

Another option: ""PACID"" - but C, I, D are allowed. ""PACID"" is not a word.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best available.

Wait, let me think of ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" is the only viable option.

But ""PAVID"" is a bit obscure. Let me try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Actually, ""PAWED"" has E which is excluded.

Let me try ""PAKID"" - not a word.

Another approach: use A in position 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - no A.

""PUCKA"" - but C, K, A are allowed, and A is in position 5. ""PUCKA"" is a word (slang for puck).

""PUC"" + ""KA"" - but ""PUCKA"" is 5 letters: P, U, C, K, A.

This seems valid.

""PUCKA"" - positions: P(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), A(5).

This tests U, C, K, and places A in position 5.

This seems better than ""PAVID"" as it tests more new letters (U, C, K) and places A in position 5.

I'll go with ""PUCKA"".

But to be sure, let me check: P is correct in position 1. The word is P _ _ _ A, with no R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Letters used in ""PUCKA"": P, U, C, K, A. All allowed.

""PUCKA"" is a valid word (slang for puck, a piece of ice hockey equipment).

Thus, the next guess is ""PUCKA"".

Vowels: A (must be in position 2 or 4), I, Y (sometimes).
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P (already used), Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing A in position 2 or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 2: P A _ _ _

Let’s explore both:

1. Position 2: P A _ _ _

   - Possible combinations: P A B _ _, P A D _ _, P A F _ _, etc.
   - Example: P A B I D → ""PABID"" (but not a common word).
   - Example: P A G E D → but E is excluded.
   - Example: P A I D _ → but need 5 letters.

2. Position 4: P _ _ A _
   - Example: P B I A D (not a word).
   - Example: P H I A L (not a word).
   - Example: P M I A D (not a word).

Looking for real words:

- P A I N T → but N and T are excluded.
- P A I S Y → but S is excluded.
- P A I N T → already excluded.
- P A I D _ → need 5 letters.

Realizing the constraints, let’s list possible 5-letter words starting with P, containing A in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- P A I D _ → no 5-letter word ends with D here.
- P A I R D → but R is excluded.
- P A I N T → excluded letters.
- P A I S Y → S excluded.
- P A I L Y → L excluded.
- P A I K _ → K excluded.
- P A I L _ → L excluded.
- P A I R _ → R excluded.

Looking at position 4:
- P B I A D → not a word.
- P H I A D → not a word.
- P M I A D → not a word.

Alternative: P A I D _ → no.

Another approach: use ""PAVID"" - but V and D are allowed, but ""PAVID"" is P A V I D, which has A in position 2, V, I, D allowed. But ""PAVID"" is a valid word (meaning full of energy).

Let me check ""PAVID"":

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or at least in the word.

Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it covers more unique vowels.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 1st).

Good consonants to try next (since R, S are out) include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Vowels we haven’t tried yet (besides A) are I and U.

A balanced next guess should include A in a different position and test new letters.  
A word like “TAINT” uses A in position 2 and brings in T, I, N.  
Another option is “PLANT” (A in position 3, P, L, N, T).

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P is in the correct position (position 1).
   - L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (not in positions 1 or 3), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to pick a word that places A in position 2 and tests new consonants. A good candidate is ""PABUK"" (but K is less common). Another option is ""PAINT"" but T is already excluded. ""PAVID"" (but V and D are less common). 

A better choice is ""PACED"" but E and D are already excluded/allowed? Wait, E is excluded, D is allowed. But ""PACED"" has E which is excluded. 

Looking for words starting with P, containing A, avoiding R,O,S,E,L,N,T. 

""PAVED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.
""PAINT"" - T is excluded.
""PAKED"" - E is excluded.
""PAWED"" - E is excluded.

Alternative: ""PAMID"" - but M, I, D are allowed. However, ""PAMID"" is not a common word.

Another approach: use ""PAVID"" - V and D are allowed, but ""PAVID"" means full of energy, which is a bit obscure.

A more common word: ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

Wait, let’s list possible letters:
Allowed letters: A, P (already used), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word starting with P, with A not in positions 1 or 3.

Let’s try ""PAVID"" - positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), D(5). This uses new letters V, I, D. 

""PAVID"" seems reasonable.

But to be more common, let’s try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Another option: ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best among less common words. Alternatively, ""PAKID"" - but K, I, D are allowed, but ""PAKID"" is not a word.

Another angle: use A in position 4 or 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - but B, I, C are allowed, and A is in position 4. But C is allowed, I is allowed, B is allowed. However, ""PUBIC"" doesn't have A.

Wait, we need A in the word. So let’s try ""PACED"" - but E is excluded.

""PAVID"" seems to be the only 5-letter word starting with P, containing A (in position 2), and using allowed letters.

But let me think of others: ""PABUK"" - but K is allowed, B, U are allowed. ""PABUK"" is a word (a type of bread in some countries).

""PABUK"" - positions: P(1), A(2), B(3), U(4), K(5). This uses B, U, K which are allowed.

Between ""PAVID"" and ""PABUK"", ""PABUK"" seems more like a valid word (even if obscure), but ""PAVID"" is also valid.

I'll go with ""PAVID"" as it tests V and D which are new letters.

But to be more common, let me try ""PAKID"" - no, not a word.

Another option: ""PACID"" - but C, I, D are allowed. ""PACID"" is not a word.

""PAVID"" seems to be the best available.

Wait, let me think of ""PACED"" - E excluded.

""PAWED"" - E excluded.

""PAKED"" - E excluded.

""PAVID"" is the only viable option.

But ""PAVID"" is a bit obscure. Let me try ""PAWED"" - but E is excluded.

Actually, ""PAWED"" has E which is excluded.

Let me try ""PAKID"" - not a word.

Another approach: use A in position 5.

For example: ""PUBIC"" - no A.

""PUCKA"" - but C, K, A are allowed, and A is in position 5. ""PUCKA"" is a word (slang for puck).

""PUC"" + ""KA"" - but ""PUCKA"" is 5 letters: P, U, C, K, A.

This seems valid.

""PUCKA"" - positions: P(1), U(2), C(3), K(4), A(5).

This tests U, C, K, and places A in position 5.

This seems better than ""PAVID"" as it tests more new letters (U, C, K) and places A in position 5.

I'll go with ""PUCKA"".

But to be sure, let me check: P is correct in position 1. The word is P _ _ _ A, with no R, O, S, E, L, N, T.

Letters used in ""PUCKA"": P, U, C, K, A. All allowed.

""PUCKA"" is a valid word (slang for puck, a piece of ice hockey equipment).

Thus, the next guess is ""PUCKA"".

<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(✓) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - P is correct in position 1.
   - L, N, T are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. PUCKA → P(✓) U(x) C(x) K(x) A(-)
   - P is correct in position 1 (confirmed again).
   - U, C, K are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Word starts with P.
- Contains A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
- Cannot contain R, O, S, E, L, N, T, U, C, K.

Remaining letters to consider (alphabet minus excluded ones):
Vowels: A (must be in position 2 or 4), I, Y (sometimes).
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, P (already used), Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with P, containing A in position 2 or 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible positions for A:
- Position 2: P A _ _ _
- Position 4: P _ _ A _

Let’s explore both:

1. Position 2: P A _ _ _
   - Need 3 more letters from allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Possible combinations: P A B _ _, P A D _ _, P A F _ _, etc.
   - Example: P A B I D → ""PABID"" (but not a common word).
   - Example: P A G E D → but E is excluded.
   - Example: P A I D _ → but need 5 letters.

2. Position 4: P _ _ A _
   - Example: P B I A D (not a word).
   - Example: P H I A L (not a word).
   - Example: P M I A D (not a word).

Looking for real words:
- P A I D _ → ""PAID"" is 4 letters.
- P A I N T → but N and T are excluded.
- P A I S Y → but S is excluded.
- P A I N T → already excluded.
- P A I D _ → need 5 letters.

Realizing the constraints, let’s list possible 5-letter words starting with P, containing A in position 2 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- P A I D _ → no 5-letter word ends with D here.
- P A I R D → but R is excluded.
- P A I N T → excluded letters.
- P A I S Y → S excluded.
- P A I L Y → L excluded.
- P A I K _ → K excluded.
- P A I L _ → L excluded.
- P A I R _ → R excluded.

Looking at position 4:
- P B I A D → not a word.
- P H I A D → not a word.
- P M I A D → not a word.

Alternative: P A I D _ → no.

Another approach: use ""PAVID"" - but V and D are allowed, but ""PAVID"" is P A V I D, which has A in position 2, V, I, D allowed. But ""PAVID"" is a valid word (meaning full of energy).

Let me check ""PAVID"":
- P(✓) A(2) V(3) I(4) D(5)
- All letters are allowed (P, A, V, I, D).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.

Thus, ""PAVID"" is a valid next guess.

- P A B _ D → no valid word

Realizing that the only possible word fitting P A _ _ D with remaining letters is ""PABED"" but E is excluded, ""PAFED"" is not a word, etc.

Wait, let me think differently - the remaining letters include B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with PA and ending with D:
- ""PAGOD"" - but O is excluded.
- ""PAVID"" - already played.
- ""PAPAD"" - but P is already in position 1, and A is in position 2, but ""PAPAD"" has two A's, which might be possible.
- ""PAPAD"" - P A P A D. Let's check:
  - P in position 1: ✓
  - A in position 2: ✓
  - P in position 3: allowed (P is already used, but can it repeat? The rules don't forbid repeats.)
  - A in position 4: allowed (A is in the word)
  - D in position 5: ✓
  - Letters used: P, A, D. No excluded letters (R, O, S, E, L, N, T, U, C, K, V, I) are used.

""PAPAD"" is a valid word (a type of bread or a payment in some contexts).

   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. PUCKA → P(✓) U(x) C(x) K(x) A(-)
   - P is correct in position 1 (confirmed).
   - U, C, K are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

4. PAVID → P(✓) A(✓) V(x) I(x) D(✓)
   - P is correct in position 1 (confirmed).
   - A is correct in position 2.
   - V, I are not in the word.
   - D is correct in position 5.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: P A _ _ D
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, E, L, N, T, U, C, K, V, I
- Remaining letters to try: B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters from the remaining set to form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3: B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for real words that fit P A _ _ D:
- P A B _ D → ""PABED"" (but E is excluded)
- P A F _ D → ""PAFED"" (not a word)
- P A G _ D → ""PAGED"" (E excluded)
- P A H _ D → ""PAHED"" (not a word)
- P A J _ D → ""PAJED"" (not a word)
- P A M _ D → ""PAMED"" (not a word)
- P A W _ D → ""PAWED"" (E excluded)
- P A Y _ D → ""PAYED"" (E excluded)
- P A B _ D → ""PABED"" (E excluded)
- P A G _ D → ""PAGED"" (E excluded)

Realizing the constraints, let me list possible valid words:
- P A B _ D → no valid word
- P A F _ D → no valid word
- P A G _ D → no valid word
- P A H _ D → no valid word
- P A J _ D → no valid word
- P A M _ D → no valid word
- P A W _ D → ""PAWED"" (E excluded)
- P A Y _ D → ""PAYED"" (E excluded)

Looking at the remaining letters, let me try:
- P A B _ D → ""PABED"" (invalid)
- P A B _ D → no valid word

Realizing that the only possible word fitting P A _ _ D with remaining letters is ""PABED"" but E is excluded, ""PAFED"" is not a word, etc.

Wait, let me think differently - the remaining letters include B, F, G, H, J, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with PA and ending with D:
- ""PAGOD"" - but O is excluded.
- ""PAVID"" - already played.
- ""PAPAD"" - but P is already in position 1, and A is in position 2, but ""PAPAD"" has two A's, which might be possible.
- ""PAPAD"" - P A P A D. Let's check:
  - P in position 1: ✓
  - A in position 2: ✓
  - P in position 3: allowed (P is already used, but can it repeat? The rules don't forbid repeats.)
  - A in position 4: allowed (A is in the word)
  - D in position 5: ✓
  - Letters used: P, A, D. No excluded letters (R, O, S, E, L, N, T, U, C, K, V, I) are used.

""PAPAD"" is a valid word (a type of bread or a payment in some contexts).

Thus, the next guess is ""PAPAD"".",Guess 5: PAPAD -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) P(✓) A(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
