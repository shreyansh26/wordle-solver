### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better vowel distribution.

2. AMONG → A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(-)
   - Pattern still: A _ O _ _
   - Additional letters eliminated: M, N
   - G is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A, has O in position 3: A _ O _ _
- Contains G somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5, because G was marked ""-"" in position 5 of AMONG)
- Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for G:
- Position 2: A G O _ _
- Position 4: A _ O G _

- AGLOW (but W might be less common)
- AGONY (but N is eliminated)
- AGILE (but E is eliminated)
- AGAST (but S is eliminated)
- AGATE (but E is eliminated)
- AGLOW seems the best so far, but let's check others

Alternative approach: look for words with G in position 4:
- A _ O G _
Possible letters for position 2: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

- AFOUL (but U might be okay)
- AFOOT has T which is available
- AFOUL has L which is available

But we know G must be in the word, so these don't include G.

Best candidates:
- AGLOW (A G O L W) - but W is less common
- AGONY - but N is eliminated
- AGILE - E is eliminated
- AGAST - S is eliminated
- AGLOW seems the only viable option with current constraints

Possible words:

But let's check if there are others:

Thus, AGLOW is the most plausible next guess.

Possible letters for position 2: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 5: same list

Looking at common words:
- AFOOT (but T might be okay)
- AFOUL (but U might be okay)
- AFOOT has T which is available
- AFOUL has L which is available

But we know G must be in the word, so these don't include G.

Wait, let's reconsider - we need G in position 2 or 4.

Best candidates:
- AGLOW (A G O L W) - but W is less common
- AGONY - but N is eliminated
- AGILE - E is eliminated
- AGAST - S is eliminated
- AGLOW seems the only viable option with current constraints

But let's think differently - maybe G is in position 4:
- A _ O G _
Possible words:
- AFOOT - no G
- AFOUL - no G
- ADOGS - but S is eliminated
- AFOOT - no G

Hmm, seems like AGLOW is actually the only word that fits with G in position 2.

But let's check if there are others:
- AGAPE - E eliminated
- AGATE - E eliminated
- AGLOW - seems best
- AGONY - N eliminated

Thus, AGLOW is the most plausible next guess.

But wait - in AMONG, G was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not in position 5. So G could be in 2, 3, or 4. But position 3 is O, so G must be in 2 or 4.

AGLOW has G in position 2: A G O L W
Let's check letters:
- A: ✓
- G: must be in word (from feedback), and here it's in position 2
- O: ✓
- L: available
- W: available

This seems valid.

Alternative: AFOOT doesn't have G, so no.

Wait, in AGLOW, the feedback was:
A(✓) G(✓) L(x) O(-) W(x)

This means:
- A is correct in position 1
- G is correct in position 2
- L is not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know from guess 1 that O must be in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that starts with AGO and uses only the remaining letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:

- AGATE - E is eliminated
- AGOST - S is eliminated
- AGLOW - already tried
- AGAPE - E is eliminated
- AGOAT - but T is available
- AGOBS - S is eliminated

Looking at valid options:
- AGOAT (A G O A T) - but A is already in position 1, and we don't know if A can repeat
- AGOAT seems possible, but let's check if A is allowed to repeat - the problem doesn't prohibit it
- AGOAT is a valid word (a young goat)

But let's think of more common words:
- AGONY - invalid (N)
- AGATE - invalid (E)
- AGOST - invalid (S)
- AGOAT seems the only viable option here

Alternatively, maybe:
- AGIFT - but F and T are available
- AGIFT is a valid word (someone who gives gifts)

But AGIFT would be A G I F T, which fits A G O _ _? No, it would be A G I F T, which doesn't fit the A G O _ _ pattern.

- AGONY - N is eliminated
- AGATE - E is eliminated
- AGOST - S is eliminated
- AGOAT - seems possible

Thus, AGOAT appears to be the only valid remaining option.

But let's double-check:

   - A in position 4: we don't have info against it
   - T in position 5: we don't have info against it

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better vowel distribution.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- O is in the correct third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is A _ O _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the rest of the alphabet excluding R, S, E.

Let me think of words fitting A _ O _ _:
- ALOUT
- AMONG
- ANGEL (but has E)
- APHID
- AFOUL

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet's most common letters.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better vowel distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position.
- O is in the correct third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is A _ O _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the rest of the alphabet excluding R, S, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the third position
3. Does not contain R, S, or E

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already used and E is excluded)

Let me think of words fitting A _ O _ _:
- ALOUT
- AMONG
- ANGEL (but has E)
- APHID
- AFOUL
- AGLOW
- ALOOF
- AMOUR (but has U which might be okay)

""AMONG"" seems like a good choice - it fits A _ O _ _ and uses common letters M, N, G. It also doesn't contain R, S, or E.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) O(✓) R(x) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: A _ O _ _
   - Letters eliminated: R, S, E

2. AMONG → A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(-)
   - Pattern still: A _ O _ _
   - Additional letters eliminated: M, N
   - G is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A, has O in position 3: A _ O _ _
- Contains G somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5, because G was marked ""-"" in position 5 of AMONG)
- Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible positions for G:
- Position 2: A G O _ _
- Position 4: A _ O G _

Let's think of words that fit:
- AGLOW (but W might be less common)
- AGONY (but N is eliminated)
- AGILE (but E is eliminated)
- AGAST (but S is eliminated)
- AGATE (but E is eliminated)
- AGLOW seems the best so far, but let's check others

Alternative approach: look for words with G in position 4:
- A _ O G _
Possible letters for position 2: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 5: same list

Looking at common words:
- AFOOT (but T might be okay)
- AFOUL (but U might be okay)
- AFOOT has T which is available
- AFOUL has L which is available

But we know G must be in the word, so these don't include G.

Wait, let's reconsider - we need G in position 2 or 4.

Best candidates:
- AGLOW (A G O L W) - but W is less common
- AGONY - but N is eliminated
- AGILE - E is eliminated
- AGAST - S is eliminated
- AGLOW seems the only viable option with current constraints

But let's think differently - maybe G is in position 4:
- A _ O G _
Possible words:
- AFOOT - no G
- AFOUL - no G
- ADOGS - but S is eliminated
- AFOOT - no G

Hmm, seems like AGLOW is actually the only word that fits with G in position 2.

But let's check if there are others:
- AGAPE - E eliminated
- AGATE - E eliminated
- AGLOW - seems best
- AGONY - N eliminated

Thus, AGLOW is the most plausible next guess.

But wait - in AMONG, G was in position 5 and marked ""-"", meaning G is in the word but not in position 5. So G could be in 2, 3, or 4. But position 3 is O, so G must be in 2 or 4.

AGLOW has G in position 2: A G O L W
Let's check letters:
- A: ✓
- G: must be in word (from feedback), and here it's in position 2
- O: ✓
- L: available
- W: available

This seems valid.

Alternative: AFOOT doesn't have G, so no.
Thus, AGLOW is the best next guess.

2. AMONG → A(✓) M(x) O(✓) N(x) G(-)

   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in position 4 of AGLOW). However, from guess 1 we know O must be in position 3, so this seems contradictory. Wait, let's re-examine:

Wait, in AGLOW, the feedback was:
A(✓) G(✓) L(x) O(-) W(x)

This means:
- A is correct in position 1
- G is correct in position 2
- L is not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know from guess 1 that O must be in position 3)
- W is not in the word

So the pattern is now: A G O _ _

Letters eliminated so far: R, S, E, M, N, L, W

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with AGO and uses only the remaining letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible words:
- AGONY - but N is eliminated
- AGATE - E is eliminated
- AGOST - S is eliminated
- AGLOW - already tried
- AGAPE - E is eliminated
- AGOAT - but T is available
- AGOBS - S is eliminated
- AGODS - S is eliminated

Looking at valid options:
- AGOAT (A G O A T) - but A is already in position 1, and we don't know if A can repeat
- AGOAT seems possible, but let's check if A is allowed to repeat - the problem doesn't prohibit it
- AGOAT is a valid word (a young goat)

But let's think of more common words:
- AGONY - invalid (N)
- AGATE - invalid (E)
- AGOST - invalid (S)
- AGOAT seems the only viable option here

Alternatively, maybe:
- AGIFT - but F and T are available
- AGIFT is a valid word (someone who gives gifts)

But AGIFT would be A G I F T, which fits A G O _ _? No, it would be A G I F T, which doesn't fit the A G O _ _ pattern.

Wait, our pattern is now A G O _ _, so we need words starting with AGO.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with AGO:
- AGONY - N is eliminated
- AGATE - E is eliminated
- AGOST - S is eliminated
- AGOAT - seems possible
- AGOBS - S is eliminated
- AGODS - S is eliminated

Thus, AGOAT appears to be the only valid remaining option.

But let's double-check:
- AGOAT: A(✓), G(✓), O(✓), A(?), T(?)
   - A in position 4: we don't have info against it
   - T in position 5: we don't have info against it

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet\'s most common letters.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels).
