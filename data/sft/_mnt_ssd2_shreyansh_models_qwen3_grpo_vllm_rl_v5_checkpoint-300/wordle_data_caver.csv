For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. 

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us a strong foundation to work from based on the feedback we receive. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers some of the most common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.
- Has 5 letters, none of which are O or S.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E in different positions.

- Uses only valid English words.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5

Let’s try a word like “RAISE”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R was not in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1).
- I is a new letter, but that’s fine.
- S is in position 4 (but S is known not to be in the word at all) → discard.

Next try “EARLY”:
- E in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), L and Y are new.
No S or O → valid.

But let’s try to keep the known letters together.  
“REACT”:
- R in 1, E in 2, A in 3, C and T new.
No S or O → valid.

Another good candidate is “CARET”:
- C, new letters.
- A in 2, R in 3, E in 4.
No S or O → valid.

I’ll pick “CARET” because it spreads the known letters across new positions and introduces only one new consonant cluster (CR).

- C A P E R
- Contains no O, S, T
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R was only excluded from positions 2 and 3)
- All other letters are already confirmed or allowed.

Therefore, “CAPER” is the logical next guess.

This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any. \n\nOne of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates.

From the new feedback on CAPER:
- C(✓) – C is correct in position 1.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2.
- P(x) – P is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is correct in position 4.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 5.

So the word is now fully determined: C A _ E R.

The only remaining slot is position 3.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, T, P  
Letters already confirmed: C, A, E, R  
No other constraints are given, so any valid letter not yet excluded can go in position 3.

Common remaining consonants or vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A quick check of 5-letter English words matching “C A _ E R” gives:
- C A B E R – not a standard word.
- C A D E R – valid (“cader” is archaic; “ruler” is 5 letters but doesn’t fit).
- C A F E R – valid (“cafer” is obsolete; “racer” is 5 letters but doesn’t fit).
- C A G E R – not standard.
- C A H E R – not standard.
- C A I E R – not standard.
- C A L E R – not standard.
- C A M E R – not standard.
- C A N E R – valid (“caner” is a surname, but not common).
- C A V E R – valid (“caver” is a word, but uncommon).
- C A W E R – not standard.
- C A Y E R – not standard.

The only common 5-letter word fitting the pattern is “C A V E R” (though it’s a bit uncommon). However, “C A N E R” is also a surname. 

Rechecking, the most likely valid word is “C A V E R” (short for “cave runner” or “caver”). 

Therefore, the word must be “C A V E R”.
