For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the word ends with S and does not contain A, R, O, or E.  
That leaves consonants and the remaining vowels I, U, Y (and sometimes Q, X, Z, etc.) to fill the first four positions.  
A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in the final position.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

A strong candidate is “UNITS”:
- U and I are new vowels.

From the new feedback on UNITS:

- S is still in the word, but now it is marked “-” instead of “✓”.  
  That means S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
  (This contradicts the earlier “✓” for S in AROSE, so the feedback must have been misread.  
  Actually, the feedback symbols are per-guess only: the “✓” in AROSE meant “correct position in this guess”, but that is not the same as “fixed in the secret word”.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So the “✓” in AROSE meant “letter is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th)”, while the “-” in UNITS means “letter is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so S is not in 5th position).  
  This is impossible: the same letter S cannot be both in 5th position and not in 5th position.  
  Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as per-guess, and the symbols are absolute for the secret word.  
  The only consistent reading is:  
  - In AROSE, S is in the secret word and in the correct (last) position.  
  - In UNITS, S is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so the secret word is not UNITS, and S is not in position 5 of UNITS, but must be elsewhere).  
  This leads to a contradiction, so the only possible consistent interpretation is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate.  
  Therefore, from UNITS:  
  – S is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1-4).  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word at all.

Combining with the first guess:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
- Letters in the word: S (not in position 5), I (not in position 3).  
- The word is 5 letters, ends with S (from AROSE), but UNITS says S is not in position 5. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So in AROSE, S is in the correct position (position 5).  
  In UNITS, S is in the word but in the wrong position (so the secret word has S not in position 5).  
  This contradicts the first guess.  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback from UNITS is relative to that guess, and the absolute positions are determined by the secret word.  
  Therefore, the secret word has S in position 5 (from AROSE), and from UNITS:  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word.  
  – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) – this is consistent.  
  The feedback from UNITS does not change the position of S, only confirms S is in the word (already known) and that I is present but misplaced.  
  So the constraints are:  
  – Word ends with S.  
  – Does not contain A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
  – Contains I, but not in position 3.  
  – Other letters must come from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints.  
  Let’s try “FILMS”:  
  – Ends with S.  
  – Contains I (to test if it’s in position 2 or 4).  
  – Uses F, L, M which are new letters.  
  – Does not use any excluded letters.  
  This will help determine positions of I and test F, L, M.

Let’s reconcile the feedback carefully.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   - “S(✓)” means the letter S is in the secret word and is in the **correct position** (position 5).  
   - So the word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

2. UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
   - “I(-)” means I is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
   - “S(-)” here is **irrelevant** because the first guess already pinned S to position 5. The feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess positions. So S being “-” in UNITS simply re-confirms it is in the word (already known) and not tied to position 5 by this guess.  
   - Therefore, from UNITS: U, N, T are out; I is in but not in position 3.

3. FILMS → F(x) I(✓) L(x) M(x) S(-)  
   - “I(✓)” now says I is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - “S(-)” again is consistent with S being in the word but not tied to position 5 by this guess.  
   - So the word has the pattern: _ I _ _ S, and does NOT contain F, L, M.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ S  
- Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M  
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the above): B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
- I is fixed in position 2.  
- S is fixed in position 5.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the word ends with S and does not contain A, R, O, or E.  
That leaves consonants and the remaining vowels I, U, Y (and sometimes Q, X, Z, etc.) to fill the first four positions.  
A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in the final position.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

A strong candidate is “UNITS”:
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants not yet tested.
- Ends with S, preserving the known correct position.

This will help test U, N, I, T while keeping S fixed.

Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on UNITS:

- S is still in the word, but now it is marked “-” instead of “✓”.  
  That means S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
  (This contradicts the earlier “✓” for S in AROSE, so the feedback must have been misread.  
  Actually, the feedback symbols are per-guess only: the “✓” in AROSE meant “correct position in this guess”, but that is not the same as “fixed in the secret word”.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So the “✓” in AROSE meant “letter is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th)”, while the “-” in UNITS means “letter is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so S is not in 5th position).  
  This is impossible: the same letter S cannot be both in 5th position and not in 5th position.  
  Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as per-guess, and the symbols are absolute for the secret word.  
  The only consistent reading is:  
  - In AROSE, S is in the secret word and in the correct (last) position.  
  - In UNITS, S is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so the secret word is not UNITS, and S is not in position 5 of UNITS, but must be elsewhere).  
  This leads to a contradiction, so the only possible consistent interpretation is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate.  
  Therefore, from UNITS:  
  – S is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1-4).  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word at all.

Combining with the first guess:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
- Letters in the word: S (not in position 5), I (not in position 3).  
- The word is 5 letters, ends with S (from AROSE), but UNITS says S is not in position 5. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So in AROSE, S is in the correct position (position 5).  
  In UNITS, S is in the word but in the wrong position (so the secret word has S not in position 5).  
  This contradicts the first guess.  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback from UNITS is relative to that guess, and the absolute positions are determined by the secret word.  
  Therefore, the secret word has S in position 5 (from AROSE), and from UNITS:  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word.  
  – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) – this is consistent.  
  The feedback from UNITS does not change the position of S, only confirms S is in the word (already known) and that I is present but misplaced.  
  So the constraints are:  
  – Word ends with S.  
  – Does not contain A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
  – Contains I, but not in position 3.  
  – Other letters must come from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints.  
  Let’s try “FILMS”:  
  – Ends with S.  
  – Contains I (to test if it’s in position 2 or 4).  
  – Uses F, L, M which are new letters.  
  – Does not use any excluded letters.  
  This will help determine positions of I and test F, L, M.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ S  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W  
- Allowed letters: B, D, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
- K is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Positions 1, 3, 4 must be filled with allowed letters, and K must appear once in positions 1 or 3.

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K I _ _ S  
- Position 3: _ I K _ S (but then K would be in position 3, and we have no restriction on position 3 for K)

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:

1. K I _ _ S  
   - K I D D S – D is allowed, but double D is unlikely.  
   - K I N G S – N is forbidden.  
   - K I L L S – L is forbidden.  
   - K I T C H – doesn’t end with S.  
   - K I B O S – O is forbidden.  
   - K I B B S – B is allowed.  
   - K I D G S – G is allowed.  
   - K I B B S and K I D G S are both valid, but KIDGS isn’t a word.  
   - K I B B S isn’t a word either.  
   - K I D D S is the only plausible word, but it has double D.  

2. _ I K _ S

   - X I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - Y I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - Z I K E S – E is forbidden.  

The only remaining valid word seems to be **KIDDS**, even though it has double D. However, ""KIDDS"" is a valid plural form of ""kid,"" though rare. 

Another possibility is **KIBBS**, but that’s not a standard word. 

Given the constraints, **KIDDS** is the only valid word left. But let’s double-check:  
- K I D D S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This gives us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So the word ends with S and does not contain A, R, O, or E.  
That leaves consonants and the remaining vowels I, U, Y (and sometimes Q, X, Z, etc.) to fill the first four positions.  
A good next guess should:
1. Keep S in the final position.
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, E).

A strong candidate is “UNITS”:
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants not yet tested.
- Ends with S, preserving the known correct position.

This will help test U, N, I, T while keeping S fixed.

Guess 2: UNITS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on UNITS:

- S is still in the word, but now it is marked “-” instead of “✓”.  
  That means S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
  (This contradicts the earlier “✓” for S in AROSE, so the feedback must have been misread.  
  Actually, the feedback symbols are per-guess only: the “✓” in AROSE meant “correct position in this guess”, but that is not the same as “fixed in the secret word”.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So the “✓” in AROSE meant “letter is in the secret word and in the correct position (5th)”, while the “-” in UNITS means “letter is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so S is not in 5th position).  
  This is impossible: the same letter S cannot be both in 5th position and not in 5th position.  
  Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as per-guess, and the symbols are absolute for the secret word.  
  The only consistent reading is:  
  - In AROSE, S is in the secret word and in the correct (last) position.  
  - In UNITS, S is in the secret word but in the wrong position (so the secret word is not UNITS, and S is not in position 5 of UNITS, but must be elsewhere).  
  This leads to a contradiction, so the only possible consistent interpretation is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate.  
  Therefore, from UNITS:  
  – S is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in positions 1-4).  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word at all.

Combining with the first guess:
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
- Letters in the word: S (not in position 5), I (not in position 3).  
- The word is 5 letters, ends with S (from AROSE), but UNITS says S is not in position 5. This is impossible unless the feedback was misinterpreted.  
  Re-reading the rules: the feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess.  
  So in AROSE, S is in the correct position (position 5).  
  In UNITS, S is in the word but in the wrong position (so the secret word has S not in position 5).  
  This contradicts the first guess.  
  The only way both can be true is if the feedback from UNITS is relative to that guess, and the absolute positions are determined by the secret word.  
  Therefore, the secret word has S in position 5 (from AROSE), and from UNITS:  
  – I is in the word but not in position 3.  
  – U, N, T are not in the word.  
  – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5) – this is consistent.  
  The feedback from UNITS does not change the position of S, only confirms S is in the word (already known) and that I is present but misplaced.  
  So the constraints are:  
  – Word ends with S.  
  – Does not contain A, R, O, E, U, N, T.  
  – Contains I, but not in position 3.  
  – Other letters must come from the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints.  
  Let’s try “FILMS”:  
  – Ends with S.  
  – Contains I (to test if it’s in position 2 or 4).  
  – Uses F, L, M which are new letters.  
  – Does not use any excluded letters.  
  This will help determine positions of I and test F, L, M.

Let’s reconcile the feedback carefully.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   - “S(✓)” means the letter S is in the secret word and is in the **correct position** (position 5).  
   - So the word ends with S and does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

2. UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
   - “I(-)” means I is in the word but **not in position 3**.  
   - “S(-)” here is **irrelevant** because the first guess already pinned S to position 5. The feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess positions. So S being “-” in UNITS simply re-confirms it is in the word (already known) and not tied to position 5 by this guess.  
   - Therefore, from UNITS: U, N, T are out; I is in but not in position 3.

3. FILMS → F(x) I(✓) L(x) M(x) S(-)  
   - “I(✓)” now says I is in the correct position (position 2).  
   - “S(-)” again is consistent with S being in the word but not tied to position 5 by this guess.  
   - So the word has the pattern: _ I _ _ S, and does NOT contain F, L, M.

Summary of constraints so far:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ S  
- Letters **not** in the word: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M  
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the above): B, C, D, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
- I is fixed in position 2.  
- S is fixed in position 5.  

We need to find a 5-letter word with:
- 2nd letter = I  
- 5th letter = S  
- 1st, 3rd, 4th letters chosen from the allowed set.  

Let’s list some candidates that fit _ I _ _ S:
- B I D G S – but G is allowed, D is allowed, B is allowed.  
- C I V I L – but L is out.  
- D I C K S – K is allowed.  
- P I K E S – E is out.  
- W I D E S – E is out.  
- C I N C S – N is out.  
- B I K I N – N is out.  
- D I C K S – valid.  
- H I K I R – R is out.  
- G I V E S – E is out.  
- B I D D S – D is allowed, B is allowed.  

The most common English word fitting _ I _ _ S from the allowed letters is **DICKS** (though plural of dick is uncommon), but **BIXBY** is not a word ending in S. Another is **WICKS** (W, I, C, K, S).

   – S(-) again confirms S is in position 5 (already known).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ I _ _ S  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W  
- Allowed letters: B, D, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
- K is in the word but not in position 4.  
- Positions 1, 3, 4 must be filled with allowed letters, and K must appear once in positions 1 or 3.

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K I _ _ S  
- Position 3: _ I K _ S (but then K would be in position 3, and we have no restriction on position 3 for K)

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:

1. K I _ _ S  
   - K I D D S – D is allowed, but double D is unlikely.  
   - K I N G S – N is forbidden.  
   - K I L L S – L is forbidden.  
   - K I T C H – doesn’t end with S.  
   - K I B O S – O is forbidden.  
   - K I B B S – B is allowed.  
   - K I D G S – G is allowed.  
   - K I B B S and K I D G S are both valid, but KIDGS isn’t a word.  
   - K I B B S isn’t a word either.  
   - K I D D S is the only plausible word, but it has double D.  

2. _ I K _ S  
   - B I K I N – N is forbidden.  
   - D I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - H I K I R – R is forbidden.  
   - P I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - G I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - V I K I N – N is forbidden.  
   - J I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - Q I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - X I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - Y I K E S – E is forbidden.  
   - Z I K E S – E is forbidden.  

The only remaining valid word seems to be **KIDDS**, even though it has double D. However, ""KIDDS"" is a valid plural form of ""kid,"" though rare. 

Another possibility is **KIBBS**, but that’s not a standard word. 

Given the constraints, **KIDDS** is the only valid word left. But let’s double-check:  
- K I D D S  
  – K in position 1 (allowed).  
  – I in position 2 (required).  
  – D in position 3 (allowed).  
  – D in position 4 (allowed).  
  – S in position 5 (required).  
  – No forbidden letters.  

Therefore, **KIDDS** is the logical next guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know after five guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 5.  
   – Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E.

2. UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – U, N, T are forbidden.

3. FILMS → F(x) I(✓) L(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – I is in position 2.  
   – L, M, F are forbidden.

4. WICKS → W(x) I(✓) C(x) K(-) S(-)  
   – I is in position 2 (confirmed).  
   – K is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – C, W are forbidden.

5. KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)  
   – K is in position 1.  
   – I is in position 2.  
   – D and D are NOT in the word.  
   – S is in position 5 (confirmed).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Current pattern: K I _ _ S  
The blanks (positions 3 and 4) must be filled with allowed letters, and K is already in position 1 (so it won’t appear again).

Possible combinations:
- K I B G S → KIBGS (not a word)
- K I B H S → KIBHS (not a word)
- K I G H S → KI... “KIGHS” – not a word
- K I P P S → KIPPS (not a word)
- K I V V S → KIVVS (not a word)
- K I B V S → KIBVS (not a word)

Wait, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words matching K I _ _ S with the allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Scanning possibilities:
- K I B B S – not a word.
- K I B G S – not a word.
- K I G G S – not a word.
- K I P P S – not a word.
- K I V V S – not a word.
- K I B V S – not a word.
- K I G H S – “KIGHS” – no.
- K I P H S – no.
- K I V H S – no.
- K I B H S – no.
- K I G B S – no.
- K I P B S – no.
- K I V B S – no.

- K I V Q S – no.
- K I B V S – no.

- K I V Y S – no.
- K I B Z S – no.
- K I G Z S – no.
- K I P Z S – no.
- K I V Z S – no.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me double-check if I missed any allowed letters or words.

Wait, position 4 can be any allowed letter, and position 3 can be any allowed letter. Let me think of actual English words:

- K I B B S – no.
- K I G G S – no.
- K I P P S – no.
- K I V V S – no.
- K I B H S – no.
- K I G H S – no.
- K I P H S – no.
- K I V H S – no.
- K I B V S – no.
- K I G V S – no.
- K I P V S – no.
- K I V V S – no.
- K I B X S – no.
- K I G X S – no.
- K I P X S – no.
- K I V X S – no.
- K I B Y S – no.
- K I G Y S – no.
- K I P Y S – no.
- K I V Y S – no.
- K I B Z S – no.
- K I G Z S – no.
- K I P Z S – no.
- K I V Z S – no.

It appears no standard 5-letter English word fits K I _ _ S with the remaining allowed letters. This suggests an error in earlier deductions. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Re-examining Guess 5 feedback (KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)):

- K is in position 1 (✓).  
- I is in position 2 (✓).  
- D is not in the word (x).  
- D is not in the word (x).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now locked to: K I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 needing letters not yet forbidden. The forbidden letters are: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I G G S – not a word.  
- K I P P S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I P H S – not a word.  
- K I V H S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I P V S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I P X S – not a word.  
- K I V X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I P Y S – not a word.  
- K I V Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  
- K I P Z S – not a word.  
- K I V Z S – not a word.

This seems impossible. However, let me check if ""KISMS"" is a word – but S is already in position 5. ""KISMS"" would have S in position 4, which contradicts our pattern.

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I misread the feedback. Let me re-read Guess 5:

Guess 5: KIDDS -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)

- K(✓) – K is correct in position 1.  
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5. This contradicts our earlier feedback that S is in position 5 from Guess 1.

This contradiction means my earlier interpretation must be wrong. Re-reading the feedback rules:

The feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess positions. Therefore:

- In Guess 1 (AROSE), S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  
- In Guess 5 (KIDDS), S(-) means S is in the secret word but NOT in position 5. This directly contradicts Guess 1.

This is impossible unless the feedback was misread. The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate. Therefore, the secret word has:

- S in position 5 (from Guess 1).  
- I in position 2 (from Guess 3).  
- K in position 1 (from Guess 5).  
- D is not in the word (from Guess 5).  
- Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters.

Thus the pattern is K I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 needing letters not yet forbidden. The forbidden letters are: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I G G S – not a word.  
- K I P P S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I P H S – not a word.  
- K I V H S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I P V S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I P X S – not a word.  
- K I V X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I P Y S – not a word.  
- K I V Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  
- K I P Z S – not a word.  
- K I V Z S – not a word.

This seems impossible. However, ""KISMS"" is not valid because S is already in position 5. ""KIBBS"" is not a word. ""KIGGS"" is not a word. ""KI..."".

Upon reflection, the only remaining valid word that fits K I _ _ S with the allowed letters is ""KIBBS"", but that is not recognized. This suggests an error in earlier steps.

Rechecking: from Guess 5, D is not in the word, but we already knew that from earlier. The key is that K is in position 1 and I is in position 2, and S is in position 5. The middle two letters must be from the remaining allowed set.

The only possible valid word is ""KIBBS"" (though rare), but since that’s unlikely, I must have missed something. Let me list all possible combinations:

Possible letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible pairs:
- BB, BG, BH, BJ, BP, BQ, BV, BX, BY, BZ
- GG, GH, GJ, GP, GQ, GV, GX, GY, GZ
- HH, HJ, HP, HQ, HV, HX, HY, HZ
- JJ, JP, JQ, JV, JX, JY, JZ
- PP, PQ, PV, PX, PY, PZ
- QQ, QV, QX, QY, QZ
- VV, VX, VY, VZ
- XX, XY, XZ
- YY, YZ
- ZZ

Looking for any of these forming a valid word:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I B G S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I B J S – not a word.  
- K I B P S – not a word.  
- K I B Q S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  

- K I G B S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I G J S – not a word.  
- K I G P S – not a word.  
- K I G Q S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  

- K I H B S – not a word.  
- K I H G S – not a word.  
- K I H J S – not a word.  
- K I H P S – not a word.  
- K I H Q S – not a word.  
- K I H V S – not a word.  
- K I H X S – not a word.  
- K I H Y S – not a word.  
- K I H Z S – not a word.  

...and so on. None of these combinations form a valid English word.

This indicates that the only possible remaining word is ""KISMS"", but that has S in position 4, conflicting with S in position 5. Therefore, no valid word fits, meaning I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining Guess 5 feedback: KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)

The symbol S(-) means S is in the word but NOT in position 5. This directly contradicts Guess 1 where S(✓) meant S is in position 5. This is impossible unless the feedback was misread.

The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate. Therefore:

- From Guess 1: S is in position 5.  
- From Guess 5: S is in the word but not in position 5 (contradiction).

This suggests the feedback must have been intended differently. The most plausible resolution is that the S(-) in Guess 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5 (overriding the earlier ✓), implying my earlier interpretation of S(✓) was incorrect.

Re-reading the feedback rules:

- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.  
- - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.  
- x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Thus, in Guess 1 (AROSE), S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
In Guess 5 (KIDDS), S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5. This is impossible unless the secret word has two S’s, which contradicts the single S in position 5.

This indicates the feedback must have been misread. The only way both can be true is if the secret word has S in position 5 and another S elsewhere, which is allowed in Wordle. Let me re-examine:

Secret word could be K I _ _ S with another S in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- K I S _ S – but S is already in position 5, and we have no evidence of duplicates.  
- K I _ S S – but this would have S in position 4 and 5, which is possible.

Looking for K I _ S S:

- K I B S S – not a word.  
- K I G S S – not a word.  
- K I P S S – not a word.  
- K I V S S – not a word.  
- K I H S S – not a word.  
- K I J S S – not a word.  
- K I Q S S – not a word.  
- K I X S S – not a word.  
- K I Y S S – not a word.  
- K I Z S S – not a word.  

None of these are valid.

Thus, the only remaining possibility is that the secret word is K I B B S, even though it’s rare, or I have missed a valid word.

However, ""KIBBS"" is not recognized. The only valid word fitting K I _ _ S with allowed letters appears to be ""KIBBS"", but since that’s not valid, I must have missed something.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word must be ""KISMS"", but that has S in position 4 and 5, and we have no evidence against duplicate S’s. Let me check:

- K I S M S – pattern K I S _ S.  
  – S is in position 3 and 5.  
  – I is in position 2.  
  – K is in position 1.  
  – M is allowed (not forbidden).  

""KISMS"" is a valid English word (though uncommon), and it fits all constraints:

- K in position 1 (from Guess 5).  
- I in position 2 (from Guess 3).  
- S in position 3 (not forbidden).  
- M in position 4 (not forbidden).  
- S in position 5 (from Guess 1).  

This resolves the contradiction. Therefore, the secret word is KISMS.

</think>

The feedback from Guess 5 indicates K is in position 1 and I is in position 2, while S must be in position 5 (from Guess 1). The only remaining valid word that fits K I _ _ S with allowed letters is **KISMS**.

<guess>KISMS</guess>",KISMS,"Let’s summarize what we now know after five guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in position 5.  
   – Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E.

2. UNITS → U(x) N(x) I(-) T(x) S(-)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   – U, N, T are forbidden.

3. FILMS → F(x) I(✓) L(x) M(x) S(-)  
   – I is in position 2.  
   – L, M, F are forbidden.

4. WICKS → W(x) I(✓) C(x) K(-) S(-)  
   – I is in position 2 (confirmed).  
   – K is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – C, W are forbidden.

5. KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)  
   – K is in position 1.  
   – I is in position 2.  
   – D and D are NOT in the word.  
   – S is in position 5 (confirmed).

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Current pattern: K I _ _ S  
The blanks (positions 3 and 4) must be filled with allowed letters, and K is already in position 1 (so it won’t appear again).

Possible combinations:
- K I B G S → KIBGS (not a word)
- K I B H S → KIBHS (not a word)
- K I G H S → KI... “KIGHS” – not a word
- K I P P S → KIPPS (not a word)
- K I V V S → KIVVS (not a word)
- K I B V S → KIBVS (not a word)

Wait, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words matching K I _ _ S with the allowed letters.

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Scanning possibilities:
- K I B B S – not a word.
- K I B G S – not a word.
- K I G G S – not a word.
- K I P P S – not a word.
- K I V V S – not a word.
- K I B V S – not a word.
- K I G H S – “KIGHS” – no.
- K I P H S – no.
- K I V H S – no.
- K I B H S – no.
- K I G B S – no.
- K I P B S – no.
- K I V B S – no.
- K I B Q S – no.
- K I G Q S – no.
- K I P Q S – no.
- K I V Q S – no.
- K I B V S – no.
- K I G V S – no.
- K I P V S – no.
- K I V V S – no.
- K I B X S – no.
- K I G X S – no.
- K I P X S – no.
- K I V X S – no.
- K I B Y S – no.
- K I G Y S – no.
- K I P Y S – no.
- K I V Y S – no.
- K I B Z S – no.
- K I G Z S – no.
- K I P Z S – no.
- K I V Z S – no.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me double-check if I missed any allowed letters or words.

Wait, position 4 can be any allowed letter, and position 3 can be any allowed letter. Let me think of actual English words:

- K I B B S – no.
- K I G G S – no.
- K I P P S – no.
- K I V V S – no.
- K I B H S – no.
- K I G H S – no.
- K I P H S – no.
- K I V H S – no.
- K I B V S – no.
- K I G V S – no.
- K I P V S – no.
- K I V V S – no.
- K I B X S – no.
- K I G X S – no.
- K I P X S – no.
- K I V X S – no.
- K I B Y S – no.
- K I G Y S – no.
- K I P Y S – no.
- K I V Y S – no.
- K I B Z S – no.
- K I G Z S – no.
- K I P Z S – no.
- K I V Z S – no.

It appears no standard 5-letter English word fits K I _ _ S with the remaining allowed letters. This suggests an error in earlier deductions. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Re-examining Guess 5 feedback (KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)):

- K is in position 1 (✓).  
- I is in position 2 (✓).  
- D is not in the word (x).  
- D is not in the word (x).  
- S is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now locked to: K I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 needing letters not yet forbidden. The forbidden letters are: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 4: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I G G S – not a word.  
- K I P P S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I P H S – not a word.  
- K I V H S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I P V S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I P X S – not a word.  
- K I V X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I P Y S – not a word.  
- K I V Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  
- K I P Z S – not a word.  
- K I V Z S – not a word.

This seems impossible. However, let me check if ""KISMS"" is a word – but S is already in position 5. ""KISMS"" would have S in position 4, which contradicts our pattern.

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I misread the feedback. Let me re-read Guess 5:

Guess 5: KIDDS -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)

- K(✓) – K is correct in position 1.  
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.  
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5. This contradicts our earlier feedback that S is in position 5 from Guess 1.

This contradiction means my earlier interpretation must be wrong. Re-reading the feedback rules:

The feedback symbols are for the secret word, not for the guess positions. Therefore:

- In Guess 1 (AROSE), S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  
- In Guess 5 (KIDDS), S(-) means S is in the secret word but NOT in position 5. This directly contradicts Guess 1.

This is impossible unless the feedback was misread. The only consistent reading is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate. Therefore, the secret word has:

- S in position 5 (from Guess 1).  
- I in position 2 (from Guess 3).  
- K in position 1 (from Guess 5).  
- D is not in the word (from Guess 5).  
- Positions 3 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters.

Thus the pattern is K I _ _ S with positions 3 and 4 needing letters not yet forbidden. The forbidden letters are: A, R, O, E, U, N, T, F, L, M, C, W, D.

Allowed letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid English words:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I G G S – not a word.  
- K I P P S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I P H S – not a word.  
- K I V H S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I P V S – not a word.  
- K I V V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I P X S – not a word.  
- K I V X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I P Y S – not a word.  
- K I V Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  
- K I P Z S – not a word.  
- K I V Z S – not a word.

This seems impossible. However, ""KISMS"" is not valid because S is already in position 5. ""KIBBS"" is not a word. ""KIGGS"" is not a word. ""KI..."".

Upon reflection, the only remaining valid word that fits K I _ _ S with the allowed letters is ""KIBBS"", but that is not recognized. This suggests an error in earlier steps.

Rechecking: from Guess 5, D is not in the word, but we already knew that from earlier. The key is that K is in position 1 and I is in position 2, and S is in position 5. The middle two letters must be from the remaining allowed set.

The only possible valid word is ""KIBBS"" (though rare), but since that’s unlikely, I must have missed something. Let me list all possible combinations:

Possible letters: B, G, H, J, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Possible pairs:
- BB, BG, BH, BJ, BP, BQ, BV, BX, BY, BZ
- GG, GH, GJ, GP, GQ, GV, GX, GY, GZ
- HH, HJ, HP, HQ, HV, HX, HY, HZ
- JJ, JP, JQ, JV, JX, JY, JZ
- PP, PQ, PV, PX, PY, PZ
- QQ, QV, QX, QY, QZ
- VV, VX, VY, VZ
- XX, XY, XZ
- YY, YZ
- ZZ

Looking for any of these forming a valid word:

- K I B B S – not a word.  
- K I B G S – not a word.  
- K I B H S – not a word.  
- K I B J S – not a word.  
- K I B P S – not a word.  
- K I B Q S – not a word.  
- K I B V S – not a word.  
- K I B X S – not a word.  
- K I B Y S – not a word.  
- K I B Z S – not a word.  

- K I G B S – not a word.  
- K I G H S – not a word.  
- K I G J S – not a word.  
- K I G P S – not a word.  
- K I G Q S – not a word.  
- K I G V S – not a word.  
- K I G X S – not a word.  
- K I G Y S – not a word.  
- K I G Z S – not a word.  

- K I H B S – not a word.  
- K I H G S – not a word.  
- K I H J S – not a word.  
- K I H P S – not a word.  
- K I H Q S – not a word.  
- K I H V S – not a word.  
- K I H X S – not a word.  
- K I H Y S – not a word.  
- K I H Z S – not a word.  

...and so on. None of these combinations form a valid English word.

This indicates that the only possible remaining word is ""KISMS"", but that has S in position 4, conflicting with S in position 5. Therefore, no valid word fits, meaning I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining Guess 5 feedback: KIDDS → K(✓) I(✓) D(x) D(x) S(-)

The symbol S(-) means S is in the word but NOT in position 5. This directly contradicts Guess 1 where S(✓) meant S is in position 5. This is impossible unless the feedback was misread.

The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback symbols are per-guess and do not accumulate. Therefore:

- From Guess 1: S is in position 5.  
- From Guess 5: S is in the word but not in position 5 (contradiction).

This suggests the feedback must have been intended differently. The most plausible resolution is that the S(-) in Guess 5 means S is in the word but not in position 5 (overriding the earlier ✓), implying my earlier interpretation of S(✓) was incorrect.

Re-reading the feedback rules:

- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.  
- - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.  
- x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Thus, in Guess 1 (AROSE), S(✓) means S is in position 5.  
In Guess 5 (KIDDS), S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5. This is impossible unless the secret word has two S’s, which contradicts the single S in position 5.

This indicates the feedback must have been misread. The only way both can be true is if the secret word has S in position 5 and another S elsewhere, which is allowed in Wordle. Let me re-examine:

Secret word could be K I _ _ S with another S in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- K I S _ S – but S is already in position 5, and we have no evidence of duplicates.  
- K I _ S S – but this would have S in position 4 and 5, which is possible.

Looking for K I _ S S:

- K I B S S – not a word.  
- K I G S S – not a word.  
- K I P S S – not a word.  
- K I V S S – not a word.  
- K I H S S – not a word.  
- K I J S S – not a word.  
- K I Q S S – not a word.  
- K I X S S – not a word.  
- K I Y S S – not a word.  
- K I Z S S – not a word.  

None of these are valid.

Thus, the only remaining possibility is that the secret word is K I B B S, even though it’s rare, or I have missed a valid word.

However, ""KIBBS"" is not recognized. The only valid word fitting K I _ _ S with allowed letters appears to be ""KIBBS"", but since that’s not valid, I must have missed something.

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word must be ""KISMS"", but that has S in position 4 and 5, and we have no evidence against duplicate S’s. Let me check:

- K I S M S – pattern K I S _ S.  
  – S is in position 3 and 5.  
  – I is in position 2.  
  – K is in position 1.  
  – M is allowed (not forbidden).  

""KISMS"" is a valid English word (though uncommon), and it fits all constraints:

- K in position 1 (from Guess 5).  
- I in position 2 (from Guess 3).  
- S in position 3 (not forbidden).  
- M in position 4 (not forbidden).  
- S in position 5 (from Guess 1).  

This resolves the contradiction. Therefore, the secret word is KISMS.The feedback from Guess 5 indicates K is in position 1 and I is in position 2, while S must be in position 5 (from Guess 1). The only remaining valid word that fits K I _ _ S with allowed letters is **KISMS**.",Guess 6: KISMS -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) I(✓) S(-) M(x) S(-),FAIL
