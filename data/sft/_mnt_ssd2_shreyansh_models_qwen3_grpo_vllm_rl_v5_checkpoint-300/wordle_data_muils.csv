For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, S is in position 4, so the secret word contains S but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 4.
- Still needs four other letters (positions 1-3 and 5).

Good next steps:
1. Eliminate A, R, O, E from consideration.
2. Try to place S in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. Use new common letters to test remaining possibilities. Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Common vowels left: I, U.

A strong candidate is a word that:
- Has S in a new position.
- Uses new common letters.

Possible words: STING (but has E, which is out), SWING (has W and G), SLING (has L and N), STINK (has T, I, N, K).

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- S (now correctly placed in position 5)
- I (was in position 3, but feedback says I is in the word but wrong position)
- L (was in position 4, feedback says L is in the word but wrong position)
- M (was in position 5, feedback says M is in the word but wrong position)

So the word must contain:
- S in position 5 (✓)
- I somewhere (but not position 3)
- L somewhere (but not position 4)
- M somewhere (but not position 5)

Possible positions for I, L, M:
Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but respecting the wrong position info)

Current pattern: _ _ _ _ S

Possible letters left (excluding the eliminated ones):
B, C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, L, M which we know are present)

We need to place I, L, M in positions 1-4, ensuring:
- I is not in position 3
- L is not in position 4
- M is not in position 5 (already S is there)

Let's consider possible permutations of I, L, M in positions 1-4, with the remaining positions filled by other valid letters.

But we have 4 positions and 3 known letters (I, L, M), so one more letter is needed. This extra letter must be from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in S that contain I, L, M with the constraints.

Possible candidates:
- ""MILKS"" - but K is eliminated
- ""LIMBS"" - B is valid, let's check:
  - L in position 1 (allowed, since L was in position 4 before)
  - I in position 2 (allowed, since I was in position 3 before)
  - M in position 3 (allowed, since M was in position 4 before)
  - B in position 4 (new letter)
  - S in position 5 (correct)
  - No eliminated letters used
  - This seems valid

Another candidate could be ""LIMPS"" but P is valid, but ""LIMBS"" seems more common.

Let's verify ""LIMBS"":
- Contains I, L, M, S
- S is in correct position 5
- I is in position 2 (not 3) - allowed
- L is in position 1 (not 4) - allowed
- M is in position 3 (not 5) - allowed
- B is new and not eliminated
- Common word meaning limbs of a body

This seems like a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, S is in position 4, so the secret word contains S but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 4.
- Still needs four other letters (positions 1-3 and 5).

Good next steps:
1. Eliminate A, R, O, E from consideration.
2. Try to place S in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. Use new common letters to test remaining possibilities. Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Common vowels left: I, U.

A strong candidate is a word that:
- Has S in a new position.
- Uses new common letters.

Possible words: STING (but has E, which is out), SWING (has W and G), SLING (has L and N), STINK (has T, I, N, K).

""STINK"" looks good:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, K are all new letters.
- Uses common letters and gives good coverage.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, K  
Letters confirmed IN the word:  
- S (wrong position in both guesses)  
- I (correct in position 3)  

Current partial pattern: _ _ I _ _

Constraints on S:  
- Cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE)  
- Cannot be in position 1 (from STINK)  

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already I, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 to keep the word common and pronounceable.  
A good candidate is “BUILD” but D is fine.  
Another is “CISCO” but O is out.  
“LISPS” has two S’s which is unlikely.  
“WISPS” also has two S’s.  
“HISSE” has E out.  
“MISST” has T out.  
“FISTS” has T out.  
“WISPS” again has two S’s.  
“CISSE” has E out.  
“LISPS” again two S’s.  
“MISST” again T out.  

Instead, let’s try S in position 5.  
Then pattern is _ _ I _ S.  
A common word: “FILMS” – F, I, L, M, S.  
All letters are new and valid.  
Checks:  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (matches).  
- F, L, M are new.  

So “FILMS” seems good.

  - B in position 4 (new letter)
  - S in position 5 (correct)
  - No eliminated letters used
  - This seems valid

Another candidate could be ""LIMPS"" but P is valid, but ""LIMBS"" seems more common.

Let's verify ""LIMBS"":
- Contains I, L, M, S
- S is in correct position 5
- I is in position 2 (not 3) - allowed
- L is in position 1 (not 4) - allowed

We have 4 slots and 3 known letters (I, L, M). That means one more letter is needed in the remaining slot, and that letter must be from the still-allowed set: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list all valid permutations of I, L, M in positions 1-4 that satisfy the constraints, then add a single unused letter to the remaining spot.

Valid permutations:
1. I _ L M → needs a 2nd letter in position 2 → e.g., ICLMS (invalid order) – let’s list systematically:

   Case 1: I in position 1  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (since L cannot be in 4 and M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a 4th letter in position 4.  
     Remaining allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
     Common word: I L M ? S – “ILM” is not a common start, but “ILM” + “PS” = “ILMPS” (invalid).  
     Try “ILM” + “CS” → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
     Not promising.

   Case 2: I in position 4  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (L cannot be in 4, M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 1 → M L I _ S → need a letter in position 3.  
     Possible word: M L I ? S – e.g., M L I D S → “MLIDS” (invalid).  
     M L I C S → “MLICS” (invalid).  
   - L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in position 1.  
     Possible word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).  
     D M L I S → “DMLIS” (invalid).  
     G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
     H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
     P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
     U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
     V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     W M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
     None of these are valid English words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

- I cannot be in 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in 1 or 4
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 ⇒ L must be in 2 or 3
- M cannot be in 3 or 5 ⇒ M must be in 1 or 2

So possible distributions:

D1: I in 1, L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I L M ? S – e.g., I L M C S → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
   No common word here.

D2: I in 1, L in 3, M in 2 → I M L _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I M L ? S – e.g., I M L D S → “IMLDS” (invalid).  
   No common word.

D3: I in 4, L in 2, M in 1 → M L _ I S → need a letter in 3.  
   Word: M L ? I S – e.g., M L C I S → “ML CIS” → “ML CIS” is not a word.  
   M L D I S → “MLDIS” (invalid).  
   M L G I S → “MLGIS” (invalid).  
   M L P I S → “MLPIS” (invalid).  
   M L U I S → “MLUIS” (invalid).  
   M L V I S → “MLVIS” (invalid).  
   M L Y I S → “MLYIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

D4: I in 4, L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in 1.  
   Word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).  
   D M L I S → “DMLIS” (invalid).  
   G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
   H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
   P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
   U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
   V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
   W M L I S → “WMLIS” (invalid).  
   Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me step back and consider that the extra letter might be a consonant that allows a real word.

Looking at the constraints again, perhaps:

- I must be in 1 or 4
- L must be in 2 or 3
- M must be in 1 or 2

Let’s try:

Option: M I L _ S → positions: M(1), I(2), L(3), ?(4), S(5)  
   Check constraints:  
   - I is in 2 – but feedback says I is NOT in 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) means I is wrong position, and in Guess 3: I(-) also means I is wrong position).  
   From Guess 3: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position.  
   From Guess 2: I(✓) – I is in position 3.  
   From Guess 4: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position (so not 2).  
   So I must be in 1 or 4.  

Thus M I L _ S has I in 2 – invalid.

Another option: L I M _ S – but L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1). So L cannot be in 1.

Another option: _ I L M S – but S must be in 5, so this would be _ I L M S.  
   Then I is in 2 – invalid (I cannot be in 2).

Another option: _ L I M S – I in 3 – invalid (from Guess 2: I is in position 3, but feedback said I(✓) means I is correct in position 3. Wait, no: Guess 2 feedback was I(✓) meaning I is correct in position 3. But Guess 3 feedback was I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position. This is contradictory unless I misread.

Wait, let me re-check Guess 2 and Guess 3:

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means I is in position 3 and correct.

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means I is in the word but wrong position (so not 3), but Guess 2 said I is in position 3. This is impossible unless I misread.

Ah! I think I misread Guess 3. Let me re-check:

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means:
   - F: not in word
   - I: in word but wrong position (so not position 2, since I is in position 2 in FILMS)
   - L: in word but wrong position (so not position 3)
   - M: in word but wrong position (so not position 4)
   - S: correct in position 5

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means:
   - S: in word but wrong position (position 1 in STINK, so S not in 1)
   - T: not in word
   - I: correct in position 3
   - N: not in word
   - K: not in word

So combining:
- I is correct in position 3 (from Guess 2)
- S is correct in position 5 (from Guess 3)
- L is in word but not position 3 (from Guess 3)
- M is in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3)
- From Guess 4: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1
   M(-) means M is in word but not position 3
   I(-) means I is in word but not position 2 (but we know I is in position 3 from Guess 2, so this is consistent)

So current constraints:
- Positions: _ _ I _ S
- Must contain L and M in positions 1, 2, or 4
   - L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 4: L(-))
   - L cannot be in 3 (already I)
   - L cannot be in 4 (from Guess 3: L(-) means not position 3, but that doesn't restrict 4)
   Wait, Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but wrong position, and in FILMS L is in position 4, so L is not in 4.
   So L must be in 2
- M must be in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3: M(-) in position 4), and not position 3 (already I), and not position 5 (S). So M must be in position 1 or 2.
   But L must be in position 2, so M must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: M L I _ S

Now we need a letter in position 4 that is not eliminated. From earlier, eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B

Allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching M L I ? S:

MLICS – invalid
MLIDS – invalid
MLIGS – invalid
MLIHS – invalid
MLIPS – invalid
MLIQS – invalid
MLIUS – invalid
MLIVS – invalid
MLIWS – invalid
MLIXS – invalid
MLIYS – invalid
MLIZS – invalid

Hmm, none seem valid. Did I make an error?

Wait, let me list valid English words ending in LS:

- MILKS – K eliminated
- MILDS – not a word
- MILIS – plural of ""mil"" (valid)
- MILDS – not a word
- MILKS – K out
- MILIS – valid word (plural of mil, a coin or unit)

Let me check MILIS:
- M in 1: allowed (M must be in 1 or 2, and here in 1)
- I in 3: correct (from Guess 2)
- L in 2: allowed (L must be in 2)
- I in 4: allowed (I is allowed in 4)
- S in 5: correct (from Guess 3)

Check constraints:
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- L is in 2 (not 1 or 4, so allowed)
- M is in 1 (not 3 or 4, so allowed)
- No eliminated letters used (A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B not present)

This seems valid.

<guess>MILIS</guess>
</think>

<guess>MILIS</guess>",MILIS,"Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated so far):
A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B

Letters confirmed IN the word (from feedback):
- S – must be in position 5 (✓)
- I – in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- L – in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4
- M – in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain I, L, M somewhere in positions 1-4, with the constraints above.

Possible positions for I, L, M:
- I cannot be in 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in 1 or 4
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 ⇒ L must be in 2 or 3
- M cannot be in 3 or 5 ⇒ M must be in 1 or 2

We have 4 slots and 3 known letters (I, L, M). That means one more letter is needed in the remaining slot, and that letter must be from the still-allowed set: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list all valid permutations of I, L, M in positions 1-4 that satisfy the constraints, then add a single unused letter to the remaining spot.

Valid permutations:
1. I _ L M → needs a 2nd letter in position 2 → e.g., ICLMS (invalid order) – let’s list systematically:

   Case 1: I in position 1  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (since L cannot be in 4 and M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a 4th letter in position 4.  
     Remaining allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
     Common word: I L M ? S – “ILM” is not a common start, but “ILM” + “PS” = “ILMPS” (invalid).  
     Try “ILM” + “CS” → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
     Not promising.

   Case 2: I in position 4  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (L cannot be in 4, M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 1 → M L I _ S → need a letter in position 3.  
     Possible word: M L I ? S – e.g., M L I D S → “MLIDS” (invalid).  
     M L I C S → “MLICS” (invalid).  
   - L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in position 1.  
     Possible word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).  
     D M L I S → “DMLIS” (invalid).  
     G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
     H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
     P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
     U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
     V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     W M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
     None of these are valid English words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

- I cannot be in 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in 1 or 4
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 ⇒ L must be in 2 or 3
- M cannot be in 3 or 5 ⇒ M must be in 1 or 2

So possible distributions:

D1: I in 1, L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I L M ? S – e.g., I L M C S → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
   No common word here.

D2: I in 1, L in 3, M in 2 → I M L _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I M L ? S – e.g., I M L D S → “IMLDS” (invalid).  
   No common word.

D3: I in 4, L in 2, M in 1 → M L _ I S → need a letter in 3.  
   Word: M L ? I S – e.g., M L C I S → “ML CIS” → “ML CIS” is not a word.  
   M L D I S → “MLDIS” (invalid).  
   M L G I S → “MLGIS” (invalid).  
   M L P I S → “MLPIS” (invalid).  
   M L U I S → “MLUIS” (invalid).  
   M L V I S → “MLVIS” (invalid).  
   M L Y I S → “MLYIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

D4: I in 4, L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in 1.  
   Word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).

   G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
   H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
   P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
   U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
   V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
   W M L I S → “WMLIS” (invalid).  
   Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me step back and consider that the extra letter might be a consonant that allows a real word.

Looking at the constraints again, perhaps:

- I must be in 1 or 4
- L must be in 2 or 3
- M must be in 1 or 2

Let’s try:

Option: M I L _ S → positions: M(1), I(2), L(3), ?(4), S(5)  
   Check constraints:  
   - I is in 2 – but feedback says I is NOT in 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) means I is wrong position, and in Guess 3: I(-) also means I is wrong position).  
   From Guess 3: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position.  
   From Guess 2: I(✓) – I is in position 3.  
   From Guess 4: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position (so not 2).  
   So I must be in 1 or 4.  

Thus M I L _ S has I in 2 – invalid.

Another option: L I M _ S – but L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1). So L cannot be in 1.

Another option: _ I L M S – but S must be in 5, so this would be _ I L M S.  
   Then I is in 2 – invalid (I cannot be in 2).

Another option: _ L I M S – I in 3 – invalid (from Guess 2: I is in position 3, but feedback said I(✓) means I is correct in position 3. Wait, no: Guess 2 feedback was I(✓) meaning I is correct in position 3. But Guess 3 feedback was I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position. This is contradictory unless I misread.

Wait, let me re-check Guess 2 and Guess 3:

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means I is in position 3 and correct.

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means I is in the word but wrong position (so not 3), but Guess 2 said I is in position 3. This is impossible unless I misread.

Ah! I think I misread Guess 3. Let me re-check:

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means:
   - F: not in word
   - I: in word but wrong position (so not position 2, since I is in position 2 in FILMS)
   - L: in word but wrong position (so not position 3)
   - M: in word but wrong position (so not position 4)
   - S: correct in position 5

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means:
   - S: in word but wrong position (position 1 in STINK, so S not in 1)
   - T: not in word
   - I: correct in position 3
   - N: not in word
   - K: not in word

So combining:
- I is correct in position 3 (from Guess 2)
- S is correct in position 5 (from Guess 3)
- L is in word but not position 3 (from Guess 3)
- M is in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3)
- From Guess 4: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1
   M(-) means M is in word but not position 3
   I(-) means I is in word but not position 2 (but we know I is in position 3 from Guess 2, so this is consistent)

So current constraints:
- Positions: _ _ I _ S
- Must contain L and M in positions 1, 2, or 4
   - L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 4: L(-))
   - L cannot be in 3 (already I)
   - L cannot be in 4 (from Guess 3: L(-) means not position 3, but that doesn't restrict 4)
   Wait, Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but wrong position, and in FILMS L is in position 4, so L is not in 4.
   So L must be in 2
- M must be in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3: M(-) in position 4), and not position 3 (already I), and not position 5 (S). So M must be in position 1 or 2.
   But L must be in position 2, so M must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: M L I _ S

Now we need a letter in position 4 that is not eliminated. From earlier, eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B

Allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position early on. Another popular choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In AROSE, S is in position 4, so the secret word contains S but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- Does contain S, but not in position 4.
- Still needs four other letters (positions 1-3 and 5).

Good next steps:
1. Eliminate A, R, O, E from consideration.
2. Try to place S in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. Use new common letters to test remaining possibilities. Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Common vowels left: I, U.

A strong candidate is a word that:
- Has S in a new position.
- Uses new common letters.

Possible words: STING (but has E, which is out), SWING (has W and G), SLING (has L and N), STINK (has T, I, N, K).

""STINK"" looks good:
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, K are all new letters.
- Uses common letters and gives good coverage.

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, K  
Letters confirmed IN the word:  
- S (wrong position in both guesses)  
- I (correct in position 3)  

Current partial pattern: _ _ I _ _

Constraints on S:  
- Cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE)  
- Cannot be in position 1 (from STINK)  

So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5.  
But position 3 is already I, so S must be in position 2 or 5.

We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4) chosen from the remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 to keep the word common and pronounceable.  
A good candidate is “BUILD” but D is fine.  
Another is “CISCO” but O is out.  
“LISPS” has two S’s which is unlikely.  
“WISPS” also has two S’s.  
“HISSE” has E out.  
“MISST” has T out.  
“FISTS” has T out.  
“WISPS” again has two S’s.  
“CISSE” has E out.  
“LISPS” again two S’s.  
“MISST” again T out.  

Instead, let’s try S in position 5.  
Then pattern is _ _ I _ S.  
A common word: “FILMS” – F, I, L, M, S.  
All letters are new and valid.  
Checks:  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (matches).  
- F, L, M are new.  

So “FILMS” seems good.

Let's summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- S (now correctly placed in position 5)
- I (was in position 3, but feedback says I is in the word but wrong position)
- L (was in position 4, feedback says L is in the word but wrong position)
- M (was in position 5, feedback says M is in the word but wrong position)

So the word must contain:
- S in position 5 (✓)
- I somewhere (but not position 3)
- L somewhere (but not position 4)
- M somewhere (but not position 5)

Possible positions for I, L, M:
Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (but respecting the wrong position info)

Current pattern: _ _ _ _ S

Possible letters left (excluding the eliminated ones):
B, C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, L, M which we know are present)

We need to place I, L, M in positions 1-4, ensuring:
- I is not in position 3
- L is not in position 4
- M is not in position 5 (already S is there)

Let's consider possible permutations of I, L, M in positions 1-4, with the remaining positions filled by other valid letters.

But we have 4 positions and 3 known letters (I, L, M), so one more letter is needed. This extra letter must be from the remaining pool (B, C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in S that contain I, L, M with the constraints.

Possible candidates:
- ""MILKS"" - but K is eliminated
- ""LIMBS"" - B is valid, let's check:
  - L in position 1 (allowed, since L was in position 4 before)
  - I in position 2 (allowed, since I was in position 3 before)
  - M in position 3 (allowed, since M was in position 4 before)
  - B in position 4 (new letter)
  - S in position 5 (correct)
  - No eliminated letters used
  - This seems valid

Another candidate could be ""LIMPS"" but P is valid, but ""LIMBS"" seems more common.

Let's verify ""LIMBS"":
- Contains I, L, M, S
- S is in correct position 5
- I is in position 2 (not 3) - allowed
- L is in position 1 (not 4) - allowed
- M is in position 3 (not 5) - allowed
- B is new and not eliminated
- Common word meaning limbs of a body

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (eliminated so far):
A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B

Letters confirmed IN the word (from feedback):
- S – must be in position 5 (✓)
- I – in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- L – in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4
- M – in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain I, L, M somewhere in positions 1-4, with the constraints above.

Possible positions for I, L, M:
- I cannot be in 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in 1 or 4
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 ⇒ L must be in 2 or 3
- M cannot be in 3 or 5 ⇒ M must be in 1 or 2

We have 4 slots and 3 known letters (I, L, M). That means one more letter is needed in the remaining slot, and that letter must be from the still-allowed set: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list all valid permutations of I, L, M in positions 1-4 that satisfy the constraints, then add a single unused letter to the remaining spot.

Valid permutations:
1. I _ L M → needs a 2nd letter in position 2 → e.g., ICLMS (invalid order) – let’s list systematically:

   Case 1: I in position 1  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (since L cannot be in 4 and M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a 4th letter in position 4.  
     Remaining allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
     Common word: I L M ? S – “ILM” is not a common start, but “ILM” + “PS” = “ILMPS” (invalid).  
     Try “ILM” + “CS” → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
     Not promising.

   Case 2: I in position 4  
   Then L and M must go in 2 and 3 (L cannot be in 4, M cannot be in 3).  
   - L in 2, M in 1 → M L I _ S → need a letter in position 3.  
     Possible word: M L I ? S – e.g., M L I D S → “MLIDS” (invalid).  
     M L I C S → “MLICS” (invalid).  
   - L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in position 1.  
     Possible word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).  
     D M L I S → “DMLIS” (invalid).  
     G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
     H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
     P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
     U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
     V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     W M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
     Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
     None of these are valid English words.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

- I cannot be in 2 or 3 ⇒ I must be in 1 or 4
- L cannot be in 1 or 4 ⇒ L must be in 2 or 3
- M cannot be in 3 or 5 ⇒ M must be in 1 or 2

So possible distributions:

D1: I in 1, L in 2, M in 3 → I L M _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I L M ? S – e.g., I L M C S → “ILMCS” (invalid).  
   No common word here.

D2: I in 1, L in 3, M in 2 → I M L _ S → need a letter in 4.  
   Word: I M L ? S – e.g., I M L D S → “IMLDS” (invalid).  
   No common word.

D3: I in 4, L in 2, M in 1 → M L _ I S → need a letter in 3.  
   Word: M L ? I S – e.g., M L C I S → “ML CIS” → “ML CIS” is not a word.  
   M L D I S → “MLDIS” (invalid).  
   M L G I S → “MLGIS” (invalid).  
   M L P I S → “MLPIS” (invalid).  
   M L U I S → “MLUIS” (invalid).  
   M L V I S → “MLVIS” (invalid).  
   M L Y I S → “MLYIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

D4: I in 4, L in 3, M in 2 → _ M L I S → need a letter in 1.  
   Word: ? M L I S – e.g., C M L I S → “CMLIS” (invalid).  
   D M L I S → “DMLIS” (invalid).  
   G M L I S → “GMLIS” (invalid).  
   H M L I S → “HMLIS” (invalid).  
   P M L I S → “PMLIS” (invalid).  
   U M L I S → “UMLIS” (invalid).  
   V M L I S → “VMLIS” (invalid).  
   W M L I S → “WMLIS” (invalid).  
   Y M L I S → “YMLIS” (invalid).  
   No valid word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words. Let me step back and consider that the extra letter might be a consonant that allows a real word.

Looking at the constraints again, perhaps:

- I must be in 1 or 4
- L must be in 2 or 3
- M must be in 1 or 2

Let’s try:

Option: M I L _ S → positions: M(1), I(2), L(3), ?(4), S(5)  
   Check constraints:  
   - I is in 2 – but feedback says I is NOT in 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) means I is wrong position, and in Guess 3: I(-) also means I is wrong position).  
   From Guess 3: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position.  
   From Guess 2: I(✓) – I is in position 3.  
   From Guess 4: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position (so not 2).  
   So I must be in 1 or 4.  

Thus M I L _ S has I in 2 – invalid.

Another option: L I M _ S – but L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1). So L cannot be in 1.

Another option: _ I L M S – but S must be in 5, so this would be _ I L M S.  
   Then I is in 2 – invalid (I cannot be in 2).

Another option: _ L I M S – I in 3 – invalid (from Guess 2: I is in position 3, but feedback said I(✓) means I is correct in position 3. Wait, no: Guess 2 feedback was I(✓) meaning I is correct in position 3. But Guess 3 feedback was I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position. This is contradictory unless I misread.

Wait, let me re-check Guess 2 and Guess 3:

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means I is in position 3 and correct.

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means I is in the word but wrong position (so not 3), but Guess 2 said I is in position 3. This is impossible unless I misread.

Ah! I think I misread Guess 3. Let me re-check:

Guess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  
   This means:
   - F: not in word
   - I: in word but wrong position (so not position 2, since I is in position 2 in FILMS)
   - L: in word but wrong position (so not position 3)
   - M: in word but wrong position (so not position 4)
   - S: correct in position 5

Guess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  
   This means:
   - S: in word but wrong position (position 1 in STINK, so S not in 1)
   - T: not in word
   - I: correct in position 3
   - N: not in word
   - K: not in word

So combining:
- I is correct in position 3 (from Guess 2)
- S is correct in position 5 (from Guess 3)
- L is in word but not position 3 (from Guess 3)
- M is in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3)
- From Guess 4: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1
   M(-) means M is in word but not position 3
   I(-) means I is in word but not position 2 (but we know I is in position 3 from Guess 2, so this is consistent)

So current constraints:
- Positions: _ _ I _ S
- Must contain L and M in positions 1, 2, or 4
   - L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 4: L(-))
   - L cannot be in 3 (already I)
   - L cannot be in 4 (from Guess 3: L(-) means not position 3, but that doesn't restrict 4)
   Wait, Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but wrong position, and in FILMS L is in position 4, so L is not in 4.
   So L must be in 2
- M must be in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3: M(-) in position 4), and not position 3 (already I), and not position 5 (S). So M must be in position 1 or 2.
   But L must be in position 2, so M must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be: M L I _ S

Now we need a letter in position 4 that is not eliminated. From earlier, eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B

Allowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching M L I ? S:

MLICS – invalid
MLIDS – invalid
MLIGS – invalid
MLIHS – invalid
MLIPS – invalid
MLIQS – invalid
MLIUS – invalid
MLIVS – invalid
MLIWS – invalid
MLIXS – invalid
MLIYS – invalid
MLIZS – invalid

Hmm, none seem valid. Did I make an error?

Wait, let me list valid English words ending in LS:

- MILKS – K eliminated
- MILDS – not a word
- MILIS – plural of ""mil"" (valid)
- MILDS – not a word
- MILKS – K out
- MILIS – valid word (plural of mil, a coin or unit)

Let me check MILIS:
- M in 1: allowed (M must be in 1 or 2, and here in 1)
- I in 3: correct (from Guess 2)
- L in 2: allowed (L must be in 2)
- I in 4: allowed (I is allowed in 4)
- S in 5: correct (from Guess 3)

Check constraints:
- S is in 5 (✓)
- I is in 3 (✓)
- L is in 2 (not 1 or 4, so allowed)
- M is in 1 (not 3 or 4, so allowed)
- No eliminated letters used (A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B not present)

This seems valid.

Let me step back and consider that the extra letter might be a consonant that allows a real word.\n\nLooking at the constraints again, perhaps:\n\n- I must be in 1 or 4\n- L must be in 2 or 3\n- M must be in 1 or 2\n\nLet’s try:\n\nOption: M I L _ S → positions: M(1), I(2), L(3), ?(4), S(5)  \n   Check constraints:  \n   - I is in 2 – but feedback says I is NOT in 2 (from Guess 4: I(-) means I is wrong position, and in Guess 3: I(-) also means I is wrong position).  \n   From Guess 3: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position.  \n   From Guess 2: I(✓) – I is in position 3.  \n   From Guess 4: I(-) – I is in the word but wrong position (so not 2).  \n   So I must be in 1 or 4.  \n\nThus M I L _ S has I in 2 – invalid.\n\nAnother option: L I M _ S – but L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1). So L cannot be in 1.\n\nAnother option: _ I L M S – but S must be in 5, so this would be _ I L M S.  \n   Then I is in 2 – invalid (I cannot be in 2).\n\nAnother option: _ L I M S – I in 3 – invalid (from Guess 2: I is in position 3, but feedback said I(✓) means I is correct in position 3. Wait, no: Guess 2 feedback was I(✓) meaning I is correct in position 3. But Guess 3 feedback was I(-) meaning I is in word but wrong position. This is contradictory unless I misread.\n\nWait, let me re-check Guess 2 and Guess 3:\n\nGuess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  \n   This means I is in position 3 and correct.\n\nGuess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  \n   This means I is in the word but wrong position (so not 3), but Guess 2 said I is in position 3. This is impossible unless I misread.\n\nAh! I think I misread Guess 3. Let me re-check:\n\nGuess 3: FILMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(-) L(-) M(-) S(✓)  \n   This means:\n   - F: not in word\n   - I: in word but wrong position (so not position 2, since I is in position 2 in FILMS)\n   - L: in word but wrong position (so not position 3)\n   - M: in word but wrong position (so not position 4)\n   - S: correct in position 5\n\nGuess 2: STINK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(✓) N(x) K(x)  \n   This means:\n   - S: in word but wrong position (position 1 in STINK, so S not in 1)\n   - T: not in word\n   - I: correct in position 3\n   - N: not in word\n   - K: not in word\n\nSo combining:\n- I is correct in position 3 (from Guess 2)\n- S is correct in position 5 (from Guess 3)\n- L is in word but not position 3 (from Guess 3)\n- M is in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3)\n- From Guess 4: L(-) means L is in word but not position 1\n   M(-) means M is in word but not position 3\n   I(-) means I is in word but not position 2 (but we know I is in position 3 from Guess 2, so this is consistent)\n\nSo current constraints:\n- Positions: _ _ I _ S\n- Must contain L and M in positions 1, 2, or 4\n   - L cannot be in 1 (from Guess 4: L(-))\n   - L cannot be in 3 (already I)\n   - L cannot be in 4 (from Guess 3: L(-) means not position 3, but that doesn\'t restrict 4)\n   Wait, Guess 3: L(-) means L is in word but wrong position, and in FILMS L is in position 4, so L is not in 4.\n   So L must be in 2\n- M must be in word but not position 4 (from Guess 3: M(-) in position 4), and not position 3 (already I), and not position 5 (S). So M must be in position 1 or 2.\n   But L must be in position 2, so M must be in position 1.\n\nThus the word must be: M L I _ S\n\nNow we need a letter in position 4 that is not eliminated. From earlier, eliminated letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, K, F, B\n\nAllowed letters: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nLooking for valid 5-letter words matching M L I ?

Let's digest the latest feedback.

Guess 5: MILIS  
Feedback: M(✓) I(-) L(-) I(-) S(✓)

Interpretation:
- M is now confirmed in position 1 (✓)
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (all three I's are marked ""-"" – positions 2, 3, 4 are ruled out for I)
- S is confirmed in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be: M _ _ _ S  
and the only remaining positions for I and L are 3 and 4 (since I cannot be in 2 or 4, and L has been shown to be in the word but never placed correctly).

From earlier rounds we have:
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, 5)
- I must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, 5)
- We still need one more letter in the remaining slot, chosen from the unused consonants: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we only have two letters left to place (I and L) and two positions (3 and 4). The only way to arrange them is:
- Position 3: I or L
- Position 4: L or I

However, we know from Guess 3 that L is in the word but not in position 4 (L(-) in FILMS). Therefore L must be in position 3, and I must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: M _ L I S

Now we just need to fill the second position with a letter that has not been eliminated yet. The remaining letters are: C, D, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words matching M ? L I S:

- MULIS – valid (plural of ""mul"", a variant spelling of ""mule"")
- MULIS is recognized in Scrabble dictionaries and is the correct form.

Let's verify:
- M: position 1 (✓)
- U: new letter, not eliminated
- L: position 3 (allowed, since L must be in 3)
- I: position 4 (allowed, since I must be in 4)
- S: position 5 (✓)

All constraints satisfied.
