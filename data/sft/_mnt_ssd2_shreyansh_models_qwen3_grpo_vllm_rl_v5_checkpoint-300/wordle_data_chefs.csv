### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any letters to cover as much ground as possible. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good information about which letters are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains both S and E, but neither is in the 4th or 5th positions respectively.

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in new positions.
2. Exclude A, R, O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Common letters left to test: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":

- Introduces T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S, E  
Known positions:

- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1: S(-) in slot 4, Guess 2: S(-) in slot 1). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But 3 is already taken by E, so S must be in 2 or 5.

So far the pattern looks like: _ S _ E _  or  _ _ S E _  or  _ _ _ E S

We still need to test common unused letters: L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place E definitely in slot 3.
2. Place S in a new slot (slot 2 or 5).
3. Introduce several new common letters.

Let’s try “CUBES”:
- C, U, B are new common letters.
- E is in slot 3 (✓).
- S is in slot 5 (testing the only remaining free slot for S).
- No letters from the forbidden set (A, R, O, T, I, N) appear.

From the new feedback on CUBES:

- C is in the word and in the correct position (slot 1).

2. Forbidden letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, U, B
3. E must appear somewhere in slots 2, 3, or 4 (since it was confirmed in the word but ruled out of slots 3 and 5).

We still need to test common letters: D, L, M, P, G, H, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place E in slot 2 and fill the remaining slots with new common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

A good candidate is “CLEFS”:
- C is correct in slot 1.
- L and F are new letters to test.
- E is in slot 2 (testing if E belongs here).
- S is correct in slot 5.
- No forbidden letters are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess would use a combination of these letters without repeating any letters to cover as much ground as possible. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) which should give good information about which letters are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- Contains both S and E, but neither is in the 4th or 5th positions respectively.

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E in new positions.
2. Exclude A, R, O.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Common letters left to test: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, B, etc.

A good candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S moves from 4th to 1st position.
- E moves from 5th to 2nd position.
- Introduces T, I, N which are common and haven't been tested.
- No A, R, or O.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters confirmed IN the word: S, E  
Known positions:
- E is in the word and is in the 3rd position (from Guess 2: E(✓) in slot 3).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4 (from Guess 1: S(-) in slot 4, Guess 2: S(-) in slot 1). So S must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But 3 is already taken by E, so S must be in 2 or 5.

So far the pattern looks like: _ S _ E _  or  _ _ S E _  or  _ _ _ E S

We still need to test common unused letters: L, C, U, D, M, P, B, G, H, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place E definitely in slot 3.
2. Place S in a new slot (slot 2 or 5).
3. Introduce several new common letters.

Let’s try “CUBES”:
- C, U, B are new common letters.
- E is in slot 3 (✓).
- S is in slot 5 (testing the only remaining free slot for S).
- No letters from the forbidden set (A, R, O, T, I, N) appear.

This should give us maximal new information.

That means:

- E is correct in position 3
- F is correct in position 4
- S is correct in position 5
- L is NOT in the word

So the word pattern is now completely determined except for position 2:

We just need to pick a valid letter for position 2 that hasn’t been ruled out yet.
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, T, I, N, U, B, L
Still allowed: D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

The only common letter that fits and makes a valid word is D, giving “CDEFS” – but that’s not a real word.
Next common letters: G, H, M, P, Y.

Real 5-letter words that fit C _ E F S:
- CHEFS (but “CHEFS” is plural of chef, valid)
- CPEFS (invalid)
- CMEFS (invalid)
- CYEFS (invalid)

So the only valid candidate is “CHEFS”.
