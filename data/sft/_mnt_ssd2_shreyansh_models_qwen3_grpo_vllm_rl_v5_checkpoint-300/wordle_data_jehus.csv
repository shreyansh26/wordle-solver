### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and it can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, L are new letters.
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in 5).
- No A, R, or O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and it can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, L are new letters.
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in 5).
- No A, R, or O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

Remaining common letters: N, D, C, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S and E while using remaining letters.  
Good candidates:  
- S could be in positions 2, 3, or 5  
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

A word that satisfies these: “UNCES”  
- U, N, C are new letters

- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Contains both required letters S and E

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we now have after four guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (position 5, ✓ from UNCES)

- U (must appear somewhere, but has been ruled out of position 1)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, T, I, L, N, C, B, K

Positions ruled out for each remaining letter:
- E: cannot be 1, 5 (from EBUSK and earlier feedback)  
- U: cannot be 1 (from EBUSK)  
- S: already fixed at position 5

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are therefore still possible:
D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Contains both E and U, with E not in position 1 or 5, and U not in position 1.
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for E and U:
- E can be in 2, 3, or 4
- U can be in 2, 3, or 4 (but must be together with E somewhere)

Let’s list plausible patterns:
- _ E U _ S
- _ U E _ S
- E U _ _ S
- U E _ _ S  (invalid, since U can’t be 1)
- _ _ E U S
- _ _ U E S

Scanning for real words that fit:
- D E E P S → invalid (two E’s, but we only know one E for sure)
- F U E S → too short
- D U E S → too short
- _ _ E U S → nothing obvious
- _ _ U E S → nothing obvious
- _ E U _ S → “HEXES” – but X and second E are untested and we only know one E
- “FUMES” – F, U, M, E, S: all letters allowed, positions:
  – F (new, allowed)
  – U (allowed in 2)
  – M (new, allowed)
  – E (allowed in 4)
  – S (fixed in 5)
This satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, FUMES is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and it can quickly narrow down the possible letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S and E.
2. Excludes A, R, O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

Possible structure: S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try ""STILE"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, L are new letters.
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in 5).
- No A, R, or O.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters NOT in word: A, R, O
   - Letters IN word but wrong position: S, E

2. STILE → S(-) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(-)
   - Additional letters NOT in word: T, I, L
   - S is still in word but wrong position (now position 1)
   - E is still in word but wrong position (now position 5)

Summary of constraints so far:
- Must contain S and E
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, L
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4
- E cannot be in position 5

Remaining common letters: N, D, C, M, P, U, Y, etc.
Vowels left: U (since A, O, I are out)

Let’s try to place S and E while using remaining letters.  
Good candidates:  
- S could be in positions 2, 3, or 5  
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

A word that satisfies these: “UNCES”  
- U, N, C are new letters  
- S in position 5 (allowed)  
- E in position 4 (allowed)  
- Contains both required letters S and E  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, L)

Let’s guess “UNCES”.

   - Additional letters NOT in word: N, C
   - U is in word but wrong position (position 1)

   - S is in correct position (position 5)

Summary of constraints so far:
- Must contain S and E
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, L, N, C
- S must be in position 5 (✓)
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4
- U is in word but wrong position (position 1), so U must be in positions 2, 3, or 4

Letters left to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus U and E

Structure so far:
- Position 5: S
- Position 1: Not U (since U is in wrong position), and not any of A,R,O,T,I,L,N,C
- Position 1: Could be B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, or E
- E must be in 1-4
- U must be in 2-4
- Remaining positions can be filled with remaining letters

Let's try to find a word that fits:
- Position 5: S
- Position 1: Let's try E (since E must be somewhere)
- Then U must be in 2-4
- Possible word: E _ U _ S
Looking for valid 5-letter words: EBUSK, EBUGS, etc. - but let's check:
- EBUSK: Contains B, U, K - all allowed letters
- EBUGS: Contains B, U, G - all allowed letters

Let's try EBUSK.

Check constraints:
- Contains S (position 5) ✓
- Contains E (position 1) ✓
- Contains U (position 3) ✓
- No forbidden letters (A,R,O,T,I,L,N,C) ✓
- E not in position 5 ✓
- S in position 5 ✓
- U not in position 1 ✓

Let’s consolidate all the constraints we now have after four guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (position 5, ✓ from UNCES)
- E (must appear somewhere, but has been ruled out of positions 1 and 5 so far)
- U (must appear somewhere, but has been ruled out of position 1)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, R, O, T, I, L, N, C, B, K

Positions ruled out for each remaining letter:
- E: cannot be 1, 5 (from EBUSK and earlier feedback)  
- U: cannot be 1 (from EBUSK)  
- S: already fixed at position 5

Remaining alphabet letters that have never been guessed and are therefore still possible:
D, F, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with S.
2. Contains both E and U, with E not in position 1 or 5, and U not in position 1.
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Possible positions for E and U:
- E can be in 2, 3, or 4
- U can be in 2, 3, or 4 (but must be together with E somewhere)

Let’s list plausible patterns:
- _ E U _ S
- _ U E _ S
- E U _ _ S
- U E _ _ S  (invalid, since U can’t be 1)
- _ _ E U S
- _ _ U E S

Scanning for real words that fit:
- D E E P S → invalid (two E’s, but we only know one E for sure)
- F U E S → too short
- D U E S → too short
- _ _ E U S → nothing obvious
- _ _ U E S → nothing obvious
- _ E U _ S → “HEXES” – but X and second E are untested and we only know one E
- “FUMES” – F, U, M, E, S: all letters allowed, positions:
  – F (new, allowed)
  – U (allowed in 2)
  – M (new, allowed)
  – E (allowed in 4)
  – S (fixed in 5)
This satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, FUMES is a valid next guess.

2. Contains both E and U
3. E must be in position 2 or 3

5. Uses only the still-allowed letters

Let’s consider the two possible placements of E and U:

Case 1: E in position 2
Then the pattern is: _ E _ _ S
U must then be in position 3 or 4:
- _ E U _ S → e.g., D E U _ S → need a valid 5-letter word
- _ E _ U S → e.g., D E _ U S → need a valid 5-letter word

Case 2: E in position 3
Then the pattern is: _ _ E _ S
U must then be in position 4 (since position 3 is taken by E):
- _ _ E U S

Looking for real words:
- Case 1: _ E U _ S → “DEUS” is too short, “DEUS” isn’t valid
- Case 1: _ E _ U S → “HEXUS” – but X is allowed and not yet ruled out
