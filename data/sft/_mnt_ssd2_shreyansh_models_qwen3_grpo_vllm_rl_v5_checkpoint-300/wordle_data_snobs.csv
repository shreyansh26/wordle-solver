For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying a letter that's in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and has a good mix of letters.

Let me think about why these words are good:
- They use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
- They have a good vowel-consonant balance
- They can help identify multiple letters at once
- The letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain

This should give us a strong foundation for the second guess based on the feedback.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so S is the first letter.

N must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).

Good candidate consonants to test next are L, M, P, C, H, K, etc. and a vowel like I or U.

Possible words:
- SPOIL – but P and L are new, I is a new vowel, O is correct, S is correct.
- SCOOP – but we already know O is in position 3, and we’d have two O’s.
- SHOWN – but H and W are new, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in 4), so invalid.
- SMOKE – but K and E are new, E is excluded.
- SNICK – N is in 2, I, C, K are new.
- SPOON – two O’s, not helpful.

“SNICK” looks promising: S (correct), N (in position 2), O (correct), I, K (new letters). N is in position 2, which is allowed.

Another good one is “SPOIL”: S, P, O, I, L. All new letters except S and O which are confirmed.

Between these, “SPOIL” tests more new letters (P, I, L) while keeping S and O confirmed. I’ll go with that.

- SPOIL – but P and L are new, I is a new vowel, O is correct, S is correct.
- SCOOP – but we already know O is in position 3, and we’d have two O’s.
- SHOWN – but H and W are new, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in 4), so invalid.
- SMOKE – but K and E are new, E is excluded.
- SNICK – N is in 2, I, C, K are new.
- SPOON – two O’s, not helpful.

“SNICK” looks promising: S (correct), N (in position 2), O (correct), I, K (new letters). N is in position 2, which is allowed.

Another good one is “SPOIL”: S, P, O, I, L. All new letters except S and O which are confirmed.

Between these, “SPOIL” tests more new letters (P, I, L) while keeping S and O confirmed. I’ll go with that.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying a letter that's in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and has a good mix of letters.

Let me think about why these words are good:
- They use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
- They have a good vowel-consonant balance
- They can help identify multiple letters at once
- The letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain

This should give us a strong foundation for the second guess based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O?
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else.
- E is not in the word (x)

So we now know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

I want a word that:
- Keeps O in the 3rd slot.
- Moves S to a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- SPOON – but O is already in position 3, and we’d have two O’s, which might be allowed but doesn’t help much.
- STONY – S in 1st, T, N, Y new letters.
- SHOWN – S in 1st, H, W, N, O in 3rd.
- SNOUT – S in 1st, N, O in 3rd, U, T.

Among these, “STONY” looks good: it places S in the 1st position, introduces T, N, Y, and keeps O in the 3rd slot. All letters are new except O and S, which we know about.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so S is the first letter.
3. T and Y are not in the word.
4. N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ O _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding A, R, E, T, Y).

N must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).

Good candidate consonants to test next are L, M, P, C, H, K, etc. and a vowel like I or U.

Possible words:
- SPOIL – but P and L are new, I is a new vowel, O is correct, S is correct.
- SCOOP – but we already know O is in position 3, and we’d have two O’s.
- SHOWN – but H and W are new, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in 4), so invalid.
- SMOKE – but K and E are new, E is excluded.
- SNICK – N is in 2, I, C, K are new.
- SPOON – two O’s, not helpful.

“SNICK” looks promising: S (correct), N (in position 2), O (correct), I, K (new letters). N is in position 2, which is allowed.

Another good one is “SPOIL”: S, P, O, I, L. All new letters except S and O which are confirmed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying a letter that's in the word but in the wrong position.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more vowels and has a good mix of letters.

Let me think about why these words are good:
- They use common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
- They have a good vowel-consonant balance
- They can help identify multiple letters at once
- The letters are all distinct, maximizing information gain

This should give us a strong foundation for the second guess based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the word ends in …O?
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S appears somewhere else.
- E is not in the word (x)

So we now know:
- The word has an O in the 3rd position.
- It contains an S but not in position 4.
- It does not contain A, R, or E.

I want a word that:
- Keeps O in the 3rd slot.
- Moves S to a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- SPOON – but O is already in position 3, and we’d have two O’s, which might be allowed but doesn’t help much.
- STONY – S in 1st, T, N, Y new letters.
- SHOWN – S in 1st, H, W, N, O in 3rd.
- SNOUT – S in 1st, N, O in 3rd, U, T.

Among these, “STONY” looks good: it places S in the 1st position, introduces T, N, Y, and keeps O in the 3rd slot. All letters are new except O and S, which we know about.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STONY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 3 is definitely O.
2. S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so S is the first letter.
3. T and Y are not in the word.
4. N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ O _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (excluding A, R, E, T, Y).

N must appear somewhere in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).

Good candidate consonants to test next are L, M, P, C, H, K, etc. and a vowel like I or U.

Possible words:
- SPOIL – but P and L are new, I is a new vowel, O is correct, S is correct.
- SCOOP – but we already know O is in position 3, and we’d have two O’s.
- SHOWN – but H and W are new, N is in position 4 (but N can’t be in 4), so invalid.
- SMOKE – but K and E are new, E is excluded.
- SNICK – N is in 2, I, C, K are new.
- SPOON – two O’s, not helpful.

“SNICK” looks promising: S (correct), N (in position 2), O (correct), I, K (new letters). N is in position 2, which is allowed.

Another good one is “SPOIL”: S, P, O, I, L. All new letters except S and O which are confirmed.

Between these, “SPOIL” tests more new letters (P, I, L) while keeping S and O confirmed. I’ll go with that.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: S _ O _ _
- Letters confirmed in the word: S (position 1), O (position 3), N (somewhere not position 4)
- Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, T, Y, P, I, L

Remaining possible letters (excluding the above):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are used, and Y is excluded)

N must appear in position 2, 4, or 5. From previous feedback, N is not in position 4 (from STONY feedback), so N must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
1. S N O _ _
2. S _ O _ N

Looking at remaining letters, let's consider possible completions.

For pattern S N O _ _:
Need two more letters from remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z, U)
Possible combinations: SNOUT, SNOBK, SNODD, etc. But must form valid 5-letter words.

For pattern S _ O _ N:
Need letters for positions 2 and 4 from remaining pool.

Looking for valid words:
- SNOUT: S N O U T → but T is excluded
- SNOOD: S N O O D → two O's, but O is already in position 3
- SNOCK: S N O C K → valid word, uses C and K which are new
- SHOWN: S H O W N → but N is in position 5 here, and H, W are new
- SMOKE: S M O K E → E is excluded
- SCOOP: invalid (two O's and P excluded)

From above, SNOCK fits pattern S N O C K, but N is in position 2 which is allowed. However, we need to check if N is actually in position 2 or 5. From STONY feedback, N is in word but not position 4, so it could be 2 or 5.

Another valid word: SHOWN (S H O W N) → N in position 5, uses H and W which are new.

Between SNOCK and SHOWN, SHOWN seems more likely as a common word.

But let's verify:
- S H O W N: S (✓), H (new), O (✓), W (new), N (must be in 2 or 5, here 5) → fits all constraints.

Thus, next guess: SHOWN

From all feedback:

- Pattern: S N O _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (1), N (2), O (3)
- Letters excluded so far: A, R, E, T, Y, P, I, L, H, W, C, K

Remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5:
Consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, X, Z
Vowels left: U (all others used/excluded)

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with SNO and ending with two letters from the remaining pool.

Possible words:
- SNOUT (U is allowed, T excluded → invalid)
- SNODS (S already used, D allowed → but double S unlikely)
- SNOMA (A excluded)
- SNOGS (G allowed, S already used → double S unlikely)
- SNOMB (B allowed, but uncommon)

The only valid and common word left is SNOUT, but T is excluded. Next possible is SNOMB, but it's uncommon. Actually, looking again:

SNOMB is not a standard word. The valid ones are:

SNOUT - invalid (T)
SNOMA - invalid (A)
SNOGS - invalid (G and double S unlikely)

Wait, let's list all possible combinations:

Position 4 and 5 must be from B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, X, Z, U.

Possible valid words:
- SNOUT (U, T) - T excluded
- SNODS (D, S) - S already used
- SNOMA (M, A) - A excluded
- SNOMB (M, B) - valid? ""SNOMB"" is not a standard word
- SNOMF - no
- SNOMG - no
- SNOMV - no
- SNOMZ - no

Actually, the only valid English word starting with SNO and using remaining letters is SNOUT, but T is excluded. This suggests we might have missed something.

Wait, let's check if any other word fits. The remaining letters include B, D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, X, Z, U.

Looking for words:
- SNOBS (B, S) - S already used
- SNOOD (D, D) - double D possible, but uncommon
- SNOOD is valid (slang for snout)
- SNOOD would be S N O O D - but O is already in position 3, and we can't have another O unless it's allowed. The feedback didn't prohibit extra O's.

But SNOOD has two O's, and the feedback only confirmed one O in position 3. This might be acceptable.

Alternatively, SNOOD is valid.

Another possibility: SNOOD is acceptable.

But let's check SNOOD:
- S (✓), N (✓), O (✓), O (new position 4), D (new position 5)
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

This seems to be the only valid option left.

Thus, next guess: SNOOD
