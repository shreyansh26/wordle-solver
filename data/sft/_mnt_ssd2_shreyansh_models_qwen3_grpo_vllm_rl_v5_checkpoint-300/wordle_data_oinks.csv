### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible. 

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a strong chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and even if none are correct, it eliminates many possibilities by testing these common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Letters we know are in the word: O, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O and S somewhere (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively)
- Avoids A, R, E

Let’s look for words with O and S, and common remaining letters like T, I, N, L, C, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STONE – but has E (invalid)
- SLOTH – has R (invalid)
- SPOON – has O in position 3 (invalid per feedback)
- STOIC – has O in position 3 (invalid)
- SNOUT – has O in position 3 (invalid)
- SLOSH – O in position 2, S in position 1 (valid positions)
- SLOSH uses S, L, O, S, H – but S is repeated (not ideal)
- SNOUT – already considered
- STOKE – has E (invalid)
- SULOT – not a valid word
- SLOTH – already considered
- SLOBS – O in position 2, S in position 5 (valid positions)
- SLOBS uses S, L, O, B, S – again S is repeated

Another candidate: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), but R is not in the word (already known) – actually SLOTH has no A, R, E – so it’s valid. However, T is in position 4, which is allowed since S was in position 4 in AROSE but marked as wrong position, so T is not necessarily excluded.

But let’s pick a word with O and S not in positions 3 and 4 respectively, and avoid A, R, E. A good choice is ""SLOTH"" but let me check:
- S: position 1 (allowed, since in AROSE it was position 4)
- L: new letter
- O: position 2 (allowed, since in AROSE it was position 3)
- T: new letter
- H: new letter

""SLOTH"" seems valid, but let me think of another with more unique letters. ""SNOUT"" has O in position 3 (invalid). ""SLOSH"" has S twice. ""SLOTH"" is actually better.

But wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – does it have O and S? Yes. Does it avoid A, R, E? Yes. And positions:
- O is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – ok
- S is not in position 4 (it's in 1) – ok

So ""SLOTH"" is a valid next guess. However, let me think of another word that might give more info. ""SOLIT"" – but has I and T, but O is in position 2 (ok), S in position 1 (ok), and avoids A, R, E. But ""SOLIT"" is not a common word.

Another good option is ""SLOTH"". Alternatively, ""SLOBS"" but has S twice. ""SLOSH"" has S twice. ""SLOTH"" seems best.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" – it's a valid word meaning lazy. So:

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S (both still unknown in position)

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 again (from SLOTH).  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the secret word contains:
- Exactly one O and one S, placed somewhere other than:
  – O at 3, S at 4 or 1
  – and no A, R, E, L, T, H

Remaining common consonants to test: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, Y, U, I  
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, A and E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1 or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- Letters: S, O, N, I, C — none of the forbidden letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 — but we just learned S cannot be in position 1.  
So “SONIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS”
- Letters: C, O, I, N, S — all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

This fits all the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “COINS”.

4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- Letters: S, O, N, I, C — none of the forbidden letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 — but we just learned S cannot be in position 1.  
So “SONIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS”
- Letters: C, O, I, N, S — all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

This fits all the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “COINS”.",Guess 3: COINS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) I(-) N(-) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any to cover as much ground as possible. 

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (very common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a strong chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and even if none are correct, it eliminates many possibilities by testing these common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Letters we know are in the word: O, S  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O and S somewhere (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively)
- Avoids A, R, E

Let’s look for words with O and S, and common remaining letters like T, I, N, L, C, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STONE – but has E (invalid)
- SLOTH – has R (invalid)
- SPOON – has O in position 3 (invalid per feedback)
- STOIC – has O in position 3 (invalid)
- SNOUT – has O in position 3 (invalid)
- SLOSH – O in position 2, S in position 1 (valid positions)
- SLOSH uses S, L, O, S, H – but S is repeated (not ideal)
- SNOUT – already considered
- STOKE – has E (invalid)
- SULOT – not a valid word
- SLOTH – already considered
- SLOBS – O in position 2, S in position 5 (valid positions)
- SLOBS uses S, L, O, B, S – again S is repeated

Another candidate: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2 (allowed), S in position 1 (allowed), but R is not in the word (already known) – actually SLOTH has no A, R, E – so it’s valid. However, T is in position 4, which is allowed since S was in position 4 in AROSE but marked as wrong position, so T is not necessarily excluded.

But let’s pick a word with O and S not in positions 3 and 4 respectively, and avoid A, R, E. A good choice is ""SLOTH"" but let me check:
- S: position 1 (allowed, since in AROSE it was position 4)
- L: new letter
- O: position 2 (allowed, since in AROSE it was position 3)
- T: new letter
- H: new letter

""SLOTH"" seems valid, but let me think of another with more unique letters. ""SNOUT"" has O in position 3 (invalid). ""SLOSH"" has S twice. ""SLOTH"" is actually better.

But wait, let me think of ""SLOTH"" – does it have O and S? Yes. Does it avoid A, R, E? Yes. And positions:
- O is not in position 3 (it's in 2) – ok
- S is not in position 4 (it's in 1) – ok

So ""SLOTH"" is a valid next guess. However, let me think of another word that might give more info. ""SOLIT"" – but has I and T, but O is in position 2 (ok), S in position 1 (ok), and avoids A, R, E. But ""SOLIT"" is not a common word.

Another good option is ""SLOTH"". Alternatively, ""SLOBS"" but has S twice. ""SLOSH"" has S twice. ""SLOTH"" seems best.

But let me think of ""SLOTH"" – it's a valid word meaning lazy. So:

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(-) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H  
Letters that ARE in the word: O, S (both still unknown in position)

Positions ruled out so far:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) or position 3 again (from SLOTH).  
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or position 1 (from SLOTH).

So the secret word contains:
- Exactly one O and one S, placed somewhere other than:
  – O at 3, S at 4 or 1
  – and no A, R, E, L, T, H

Remaining common consonants to test: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, F, Y, U, I  
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, A and E are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1 or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5  
Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- Letters: S, O, N, I, C — none of the forbidden letters appear.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 1 — but we just learned S cannot be in position 1.  
So “SONIC” is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS”
- Letters: C, O, I, N, S — all allowed.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

This fits all the constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “COINS”.

Now we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, L, T, H, C  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, I, N, S  
- Exact position confirmed: S is in position 5 (✓).  
- Positions ruled out for O: 3 (from AROSE) and 3 (from SLOTH) — still only 3.  
- Positions ruled out for I: 3 (from SLOTH) and 3 (from COINS) — still only 3.  
- Positions ruled out for N: 4 (from SLOTH) and 4 (from COINS) — still only 4.  
- Positions ruled out for S: 1 (from SLOTH), 4 (from AROSE), and 4 (from COINS) — still only 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ _ _ S  
and must contain O, I, N in some order in positions 1-4, with:
- O not in 3
- I not in 3
- N not in 4

Possible positions for O, I, N among 1-4 (no repeats):
- O can be 1, 2, 4
- I can be 1, 2, 4
- N can be 1, 2, 3

Let’s list valid permutations of O, I, N across 1-4 that satisfy the above:

1 2 3 4
O I N _  → N is in 3 (allowed), O not in 3 (ok), I not in 3 (ok) → valid
O N I _  → I in 3 (invalid)
I O N _  → N in 3 (ok), O in 2 (ok), I in 1 (ok) → valid
I N O _  → O in 3 (invalid)
N O I _  → O in 2 (ok), I in 4 (ok), N in 1 (ok) → valid
N I O _  → O in 3 (invalid)

So the three valid patterns are:
- O I N _
- I O N _
- N O I _

We need a 5th letter for position 4 that:
- Has not been ruled out: not A, R, E, L, T, H, C
- Common remaining letters: D, G, M, P, B, F, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick the first pattern O I N _ and find a valid letter:
O I N ? S → OIN?S — possible words: OINBS (invalid), OINMS (invalid), OINGS (invalid), OINKS (valid word, K not ruled out).

Check OINKS:
- Letters: O, I, N, K, S — all allowed.
- Positions:
  – O in 1 (allowed)
  – I in 2 (allowed)
  – N in 3 (allowed)
  – K in 4 (allowed)
  – S in 5 (confirmed)
- No forbidden letters.

This fits perfectly.
