### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, U, Y, D, H, M, W, F, G, K, B, V, P, X, J, Q, Z.

A popular and effective first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A: very common
- R: very common
- O: very common
- S: very common
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of vowels and common consonants to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word starts with A and contains S somewhere after the first letter.  
We also know the remaining letters cannot include R, O, E.

Good next letters to test are common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out:

Since S is in the word but not in position 4, it could be in positions 2, 3, 5.

Candidate words:

- A L I S _  – again need a 5th letter.
- A M I S _  – same issue.

Both positions allowed.\n\nAnother candidate: A M I D S – same idea.\n\nLet’s pick A L I D S.\n\nCheck letters used: A, L, I, D, S. None are forbidden (R, O, E, T, N already excluded).

From the latest feedback (ALIDS → A✓ Lx I✓ D✓ S✓) we now know the exact word:

Position 1: A ✓  
Position 2: L x → not L  
Position 3: I ✓  
Position 4: D ✓  
Position 5: S ✓  

So the pattern is A _ I D S, and the blank (position 2) must be a letter that has NOT yet been ruled out.  
Letters already confirmed NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N, L.  
Common remaining consonants/vowels for position 2: B, C, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words matching A _ I D S:

- A C I D S → ACIDS (valid word, C not yet tested)  
- A M I D S → AMIDS (not a valid English word)  
- A P I D S → not valid  
- A B I D S → not valid  
- A F I D S → not valid  
- A H I D S → not valid  
- A G I D S → not valid  

Only valid candidate is ACIDS.
