For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

2. Avoids L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct  

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R (fixed at position 1), S (fixed at position 5), E (somewhere but not 4 or 5).
- Letters definitely out: L, A, T, O.
- Remaining positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the excluded letters.

We still need to place E somewhere among positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).  
We also need two more distinct letters for positions 2 and 3 (or 4 if E goes in 2 or 3).

A good next test word would:
- Keep R in position 1 and S in position 5.
- Try E in position 2 or 3.
- Introduce two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try E in position 2 and use two new consonants: N and I.

Next valid word: R I N G S – but G hasn’t been tested and fits.

Wait, we need to avoid O and already excluded L,A,T.  
Valid word: R I N G S – uses R(1), I, N, G, S(5).  
E must be placed somewhere, so let’s try R I E N S – invalid.

Let’s try E in position 2 and use two new consonants: N and I.

Word: R E N S E → but S is already fixed at 5, so this would duplicate S.  
Instead, let’s try R E N D S → but D hasn’t been tested yet.

A valid word that satisfies all constraints: R I N S E  
Positions:  
1 = R (✓)  
2 = I (new letter)  
3 = N (new letter)  
4 = S (but S must be at 5) – conflict.  

Better: R E N S E – again S at 5 only.  

Let’s try E in position 3: R _ E _ S  
A valid word: R I E N S – but “RIENS” isn’t valid.

Next valid word: R I N G S – but G hasn’t been tested and fits.

Wait, we need to avoid O and already excluded L,A,T.  
Valid word: R I N G S – uses R(1), I, N, G, S(5).  
E must be placed somewhere, so let’s try R I E N S – invalid.

Another approach: R _ E _ S with valid word “REINS” – but S is at 5, so R E I N S – valid.

Let’s check:  
R E I N S  
Positions:  
1 R (✓)  
2 E (must be in word, now in position 2)  
3 I (new)  
4 N (new)  
5 S (✓)  

This satisfies all known constraints.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form R E N _ S. The only common English word fitting this pattern is R E N T S (but T is already excluded) or R E N D S (but D hasn't been tested yet and fits).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain L, A, or T.
- The word DOES contain S and E, but S is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and E in different positions (S not first, E not last).
2. Avoids L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good letters to test next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A word that fits these criteria is ""ROSES"":
- R (new letter)
- O (new vowel)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- S (again, but position doesn't matter for known letters)

This tests R, O, and keeps S and E in new positions while avoiding L, A, T.

Guess 2: ROSES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE  
S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(x), A(x), T(x) → L, A, T are NOT in the word at all  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

Round 2: ROSES  
R(✓) → R is in position 1 and is correct  
O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct  

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R (fixed at position 1), S (fixed at position 5), E (somewhere but not 4 or 5).
- Letters definitely out: L, A, T, O.
- Remaining positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the excluded letters.

We still need to place E somewhere among positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).  
We also need two more distinct letters for positions 2 and 3 (or 4 if E goes in 2 or 3).

A good next test word would:
- Keep R in position 1 and S in position 5.
- Try E in position 2 or 3.
- Introduce two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try E in position 2 and use two new consonants: N and I.

Word: R E N S E → but S is already fixed at 5, so this would duplicate S.  
Instead, let’s try R E N D S → but D hasn’t been tested yet.

A valid word that satisfies all constraints: R I N S E  
Positions:  
1 = R (✓)  
2 = I (new letter)  
3 = N (new letter)  
4 = S (but S must be at 5) – conflict.  

Better: R E N S E – again S at 5 only.  

Let’s try E in position 3: R _ E _ S  
A valid word: R I E N S – but “RIENS” isn’t valid.

Next valid word: R I N G S – but G hasn’t been tested and fits.

Wait, we need to avoid O and already excluded L,A,T.  
Valid word: R I N G S – uses R(1), I, N, G, S(5).  
E must be placed somewhere, so let’s try R I E N S – invalid.

Another approach: R _ E _ S with valid word “REINS” – but S is at 5, so R E I N S – valid.

Let’s check:  
R E I N S  
Positions:  
1 R (✓)  
2 E (must be in word, now in position 2)  
3 I (new)  
4 N (new)  
5 S (✓)  

This satisfies all known constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me the most information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words, maximizing the chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So we know:
- The word does NOT contain L, A, or T.
- The word DOES contain S and E, but S is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and E in different positions (S not first, E not last).
2. Avoids L, A, T entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good letters to test next: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

A word that fits these criteria is ""ROSES"":
- R (new letter)
- O (new vowel)
- S (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- S (again, but position doesn't matter for known letters)

This tests R, O, and keeps S and E in new positions while avoiding L, A, T.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROSES -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) S(-) E(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE  
S(-)  → S is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(x), A(x), T(x) → L, A, T are NOT in the word at all  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

Round 2: ROSES  
R(✓) → R is in position 1 and is correct  
O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 3  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 4  
S(✓) → S is in position 5 and is correct  

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R (fixed at position 1), S (fixed at position 5), E (somewhere but not 4 or 5).
- Letters definitely out: L, A, T, O.
- Remaining positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled from the remaining alphabet, avoiding the excluded letters.

We still need to place E somewhere among positions 2 or 3 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).  
We also need two more distinct letters for positions 2 and 3 (or 4 if E goes in 2 or 3).

A good next test word would:
- Keep R in position 1 and S in position 5.
- Try E in position 2 or 3.
- Introduce two new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try E in position 2 and use two new consonants: N and I.

Word: R E N S E → but S is already fixed at 5, so this would duplicate S.  
Instead, let’s try R E N D S → but D hasn’t been tested yet.

A valid word that satisfies all constraints: R I N S E  
Positions:  
1 = R (✓)  
2 = I (new letter)  
3 = N (new letter)  
4 = S (but S must be at 5) – conflict.  

Better: R E N S E – again S at 5 only.  

Let’s try E in position 3: R _ E _ S  
A valid word: R I E N S – but “RIENS” isn’t valid.

Next valid word: R I N G S – but G hasn’t been tested and fits.

Wait, we need to avoid O and already excluded L,A,T.  
Valid word: R I N G S – uses R(1), I, N, G, S(5).  
E must be placed somewhere, so let’s try R I E N S – invalid.

Another approach: R _ E _ S with valid word “REINS” – but S is at 5, so R E I N S – valid.

Let’s check:  
R E I N S  
Positions:  
1 R (✓)  
2 E (must be in word, now in position 2)  
3 I (new)  
4 N (new)  
5 S (✓)  

This satisfies all known constraints.

Current confirmed information:

1. Positions:

   - 2: E (✓)
   - 5: S (✓)

2. Letters known to be in the word:
   - R, E, S

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   - L, A, T, O, I

4. Remaining positions to fill:
   - 3 and 4

5. From Guess 3 (REINS) we also learned:
   - N(-) → N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the word looks like: R E _ _ S
with the additional constraints:
- Position 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet excluded.
- N must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 4, it must be in 3).
- Therefore, position 3 must be N.

Now we have: R E N _ S

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form R E N _ S. The only common English word fitting this pattern is R E N T S (but T is already excluded) or R E N D S (but D hasn't been tested yet and fits).

Checking:
- R E N D S: All letters (R,E,N,D,S) haven't been ruled out except T is excluded, and D hasn't been used. This seems valid.

Another possible word is R E N N S (but double N isn't common in this context and likely invalid).

Thus, the most plausible next guess is RENDS.
