### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers C, R, A, N, E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

We also know the remaining letters must come from the pool of unused common letters: D, F, G, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, Y, etc.

A good next word should:
- include R and E in still-allowed positions,
- avoid all the ruled-out letters,
- use fresh letters to maximize information.

Therefore, ROGER is a strong third guess.

From the latest feedback:

ROGER → R(✓) O(x) G(✓) E(-) R(✓)

1. R is now fixed in positions 1 and 5 (✓).
2. G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
3. E is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
4. O is not in the word (x).

So the pattern so far is:
R _ _ _ R

Letters we know must appear: G and E.
Letters we know must NOT appear: C, A, N, T, H, W, O.

Positions left to fill: 2, 3, 4.

Constraints:
- G must be in position 2 or 4 (since it’s not in 3).
- E must be in position 2 or 3 (since it’s not in 4 or 5).

Let’s list possible combinations:

Case 1: G in position 2
R G _ _ R
E must be in 3: R G E _ R
The missing letter (position 4) must be from unused letters: D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, Y.

Case 2: G in position 4
R _ _ G R
E must be in 2 or 3:
- R E _ G R
- R _ E G R

Let’s pick a word from Case 1 that uses common remaining letters. The most common unused letters are D, F, I, L, M, P, S.

A good candidate is R I G E R (but E would be in 4, which is invalid). Wait, no: R G E _ R. Let’s pick R G E S R? Not a word. R G E D R? Not a word. R G E L R? Not a word. R G E M R? Not a word. R G E P R? Not a word. Hmm.

Let’s try Case 2:
R E _ G R: The missing letter (position 3) must be from unused letters. Common ones: D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, Y. Let’s pick R E D G R? Not a word. R E F G R? Not a word. R E I G R? Not a word. R E K G R? Not a word. R E L G R? Not a word. R E M G R? Not a word. R E P G R? Not a word. R E S G R? Not a word. R E U G R? Not a word. R E V G R? Not a word. R E Y G R? Not a word.

R _ E G R: The missing letter (position 2) must be from unused letters. Common ones: D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, Y. Let’s pick R I E G R? Not a word. R D E G R? Not a word. R F E G R? Not a word. R L E G R? Not a word. R S E G R? Not a word. R P E G R? Not a word. R M E G R? Not a word. R K E G R? Not a word. R U E G R? Not a word. R V E G R? Not a word. R Y E G R? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Maybe I need to consider that E could be in position 3 and G in position 2 or 4.

Wait, let’s try R I G E R – no, E would be in 4 which is invalid. R I V E R – but O is already ruled out, but V is allowed. Wait, RIVER: R I V E R. Let’s check:
- R: positions 1 and 5 ✓
- I: new letter
- V: new letter
- E: position 4 – but feedback says E is not in 4 (-). So RIVER is invalid.

R I P E R – same issue, E in 4.

R I S E R – E in 4.

R I D G E – but G is in 4, E in 5 – E can’t be in 5 (from CRANE feedback). So no.

R I S G E – E in 5 invalid.

R I K E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I L E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I M E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I P E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I S E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I V E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I D E R – E in 4 invalid.

R I G E R – E in 4 invalid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have R _ _ _ R with G and E somewhere inside, and no O, C, A, N, T, H, W.

Possible letters left: D, F, I, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, Y, plus G and E.

The only way to place G and E without violating their constraints is:

- G must be in 2 or 4
- E must be in 2 or 3

Let’s list all valid combinations:

1. G in 2, E in 3: R G E _ R
   Need a valid 5-letter word: R G E _ R
   Possible: R G E S R – not a word
   R G E D R – not a word
   R G E L R – not a word
   R G E M R – not a word
   R G E P R – not a word
   R G E I R – not a word
   R G E K R – not a word
   R G E Y R – not a word
   R G E F R – not a word
   R G E U R – not a word
   R G E V R – not a word
   None of these are valid.

2. G in 2, E in 2 – impossible, both can’t be in 2.

3. G in 4, E in 2: R E _ G R
   Need a valid word: R E _ G R
   Possible: R E D G R – not a word
   R E F G R – not a word
   R E I G R – not a word
   R E K G R – not a word
   R E L G R – not a word
   R E M G R – not a word
   R E P G R – not a word
   R E S G R – not a word
   R E U G R – not a word
   R E V G R – not a word
   R E Y G R – not a word
   None of these are valid.

4. G in 4, E in 3: R _ E G R
   Need a valid word: R _ E G R
   Possible: R I E G R – not a word
   R D E G R – not a word
   R F E G R – not a word
   R K E G R – not a word
   R L E G R – not a word
   R M E G R – not a word
   R P E G R – not a word
   R S E G R – not a word
   R U E G R – not a word
   R V E G R – not a word
   R Y E G R – not a word
   None of these are valid.

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: ROGER → R(✓) O(x) G(✓) E(-) R(✓)

- R(✓) in positions 1 and 5 – correct.
- O(x) – not in word.
- G(✓) – in word and in correct position? No, the symbol is ✓ for R, but for G it's just (✓) – but in the feedback provided earlier, the symbols were:
  - CRANE: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - THREW: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(-) W(x)
  - ROGER: R(✓) O(x) G(✓) E(-) R(✓)

The notation is a bit ambiguous. Does G(✓) mean G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3), or does it mean G is in the word but not in position 3 (since E is (-) not in 4)?

Looking back at the original rules:
- ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
- - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
- x : The letter is NOT in the word.

In ROGER, the feedback is:
R(✓) – R is correct in position 1
O(x) – O is not in word
G(✓) – G is correct in position 3
E(-) – E is in word but not in position 4
R(✓) – R is correct in position 5

So the word is R _ G _ R and must contain E somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but 3 is G), so E must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be R E G _ R.

Now we need a valid 5-letter word of the form R E G _ R.

Possible words:
- REGAR – but A is ruled out
- REGMA – but A is ruled out
- REGOR – but O is ruled out
- REGUR – but U is allowed, but is REGUR a word? Seems rare
- REGSR – not a word
- REGFR – not a word
- REGIR – not a word
- REGKR – not a word
- REGLR – not a word
- REGMR – not a word
- REGPR – not a word
- REGSR – not a word
- REGVR – not a word
- REGYR – not a word

This seems impossible. Did I misinterpret the feedback?

Wait, the feedback for ROGER is:
R(✓) O(x) G(✓) E(-) R(✓)

This implies:
- Position 1: R ✓ (correct)
- Position 2: O x (not in word)
- Position 3: G ✓ (correct)
- Position 4: E - (in word, but wrong position)
- Position 5: R ✓ (correct)

Thus the word is R _ G _ R and E must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 4 or 5, and 1 and 3 are R and G).

Thus the word must be R E G _ R.

Now we need a valid word: REG?R.

Looking at valid English 5-letter words:
- REGAR – invalid (A ruled out)
- REGMA – invalid (A ruled out)
- REGOR – invalid (O ruled out)
- REGUR – valid (rare but recognized)
- REGPR – invalid
- REGSR – invalid
- REGFR – invalid

The only possible word seems to be REGUR, but it's quite rare. However, ""REGUR"" is a valid word (relating to regurgitation).

Thus, REGUR is the only possible word left.

</think>

Given the constraints:
- Word must be R _ G _ R
- Must contain E (since E is in word but not in position 4)
- E must be in position 2, making the word R E G _ R
- The only valid English word fitting this is REGUR.
