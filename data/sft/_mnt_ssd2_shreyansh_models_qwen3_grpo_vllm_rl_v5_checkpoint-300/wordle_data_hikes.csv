3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information

Other good alternatives would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid choice for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E.
2. S is NOT in position 4.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities. A good candidate is ""STEEP"":
- Contains S and E
- S is in position 1 (not position 4) – satisfies the constraint
- E appears in positions 2 and 5; since position 5 is excluded for E, we'll still get feedback on positions 2 and 5
- Introduces new letters T and P to test
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or O

However, ""STEEP"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. A better choice is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E
- S in position 1
- E in position 2 (not position 5)
- Introduces T, I, N
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or O

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A strong starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information

Other good alternatives would be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" is a solid choice for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are not in the word at all (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E.
2. S is NOT in position 4.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- S is not in position 4
- E is not in position 5

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters to narrow down possibilities. A good candidate is ""STEEP"":
- Contains S and E
- S is in position 1 (not position 4) – satisfies the constraint
- E appears in positions 2 and 5; since position 5 is excluded for E, we'll still get feedback on positions 2 and 5
- Introduces new letters T and P to test
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or O

However, ""STEEP"" has two E's, which might not be optimal. A better choice is ""STEIN"":
- Contains S and E
- S in position 1
- E in position 2 (not position 5)
- Introduces T, I, N
- Doesn’t contain A, R, or O

""STEIN"" seems like the better choice.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far): S, E, I  

Current constraints on S, E, I:
- S must appear, but NOT in position 1 or 4.
- E must appear, but NOT in position 2 or 5.
- I must appear, but NOT in position 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, I each exactly once.
2. Places S somewhere other than positions 1 or 4.
3. Places E somewhere other than positions 2 or 5.
4. Places I somewhere other than position 4.
5. Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, T, N).

Remaining common letters we can use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A promising pattern is to place S in position 2, 3, or 5; E in position 1, 3, or 4; and I in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

One such word is “SIEVE”:
- S in position 1 → but this violates the S not in position 1 constraint.
Next candidate: “PIVES”:
- P, I, V, E, S – contains all required letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- I is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters.

“PIVES” meets every constraint.

Remaining usable letters for positions 1 and 3:
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a real English word fitting _ I _ E S using only these letters.

Possible combinations:
- B I D E S → ""BIDES"" (valid word)
- C I D E S → ""CIDES"" (not standard)
- D I C E S → ""DICES"" (valid, but uses C in position 3 which is allowed)
- G I V E S → ""GIVES"" (but V is ruled out)
- H I K E S → ""HIKES"" (valid)
- J I G E S → ""JIGES"" (not a word)
- K I D E S → ""KIDES"" (not standard)
- W I D E S → ""WIDES"" (valid)
- Y I D E S → ""YIDES"" (not standard)

Best candidates: ""BIDES"", ""DICES"", ""HIKES"", ""WIDES""

Among these, ""HIKES"" is the most common word and uses H and K which haven't been ruled out.",Guess 5: HIKES -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
