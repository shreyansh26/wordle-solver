For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, maximizing the information I'll get from the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- A is NOT in the word.
- T is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, L, E (but none in their original positions).
- Does NOT contain A or T.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, E in different positions and avoids A and T. Let’s rearrange S, L, E while filling the remaining spots with new letters. Good candidates are consonants like R, N, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""RISEN"":
- R (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- S (moved from 1st to 3rd)
- E (moved from 5th to 4th)
- N (new letter)

This tests new letters while repositioning the known letters S, L, E (though we only show S here; we’d need to include L as well). A better word that includes L is ""LESIN"" (but that’s not a valid English word). Instead, ""SLEEK"" uses S, L, E but repeats E. ""SLEEP"" is invalid (A not allowed). ""SPREE"" has T not allowed. 

A valid word is ""SLEET"":
- S (position 1 → 3)
- L (position 2 → 2 – but L was in wrong position 2, so can’t be here)
- E (position 4 → 3)
- E (position 5 → 4)
- T (invalid, not in word)

""SLEET"" is invalid because T is excluded. Next, ""SLOPE"":
- S (1 → 1 – but S was in wrong position 1, so can’t be here)
- L (2 → 2 – but L was in wrong position 2, so can’t be here)
- O (new vowel)
- P (new letter)
- E (5 → 4)

This is flawed because S and L can’t stay in their original positions. Let’s try ""ELBOW"":
- E (5 → 1)
- L (2 → 2 – invalid)
- B (new)
- O (new)
- W (new)

""L can’t be in position 2."" 

Best valid word seems ""ROLES"":
- R (new)
- O (new)
- L (2 → 3)
- E (4 → 2)
- S (1 → 5)

This repositions S, L, E and introduces new letters. However, ""ROLES"" is good. Another is ""SLOPE"" but L is in 2 again. 

A valid word with S, L, E in new positions is ""SLEET"" (but T excluded). Instead, ""SLEEK"" is invalid (T excluded). 

Let’s use ""ROLES"" as it repositions L and E and introduces R, O.

But a better word is ""SLOPE"" – but L is in 2 again. 

Realizing the issue: we must move L away from position 2. Let’s try ""SLEET"" is invalid. 

Next best is ""SLEEK"" but T excluded. 

Alternative: ""SLEEP"" but P is new, but E repeats. 

Valid word: ""SLEPT"" – but T excluded. 

""SLEEK"" is invalid. 

""ELDER"" – but D, R new, E in 5 → 1, L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""OLDER"" – O, D, R new, L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""LOWER"" – L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""LOWER"" invalid. 

""ELBOW"" invalid (L in 2). 

""ROLES"" is valid:
- R (new)
- O (new)
- L (2 → 3)
- E (4 → 2)
- S (1 → 5)

This works. Let’s use ROLES.

Based on the feedback, S, L, and E are in the word but in wrong positions, while A and T are not. I'll try a word that repositions these letters and introduces new common letters:

   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from ROLES: E(-)).
   - From SLATE: S was wrong in 1, L wrong in 2, E wrong in 5.

So far:
- S is confirmed in position 5.
- L is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is taken by S), so 1 or 4.
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken), so 1, 2, or 3.

Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, T, R, O).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with L and E somewhere in the first four positions, and no A, T, R, O.

Possible structure: _ _ _ E _ or _ _ E _ _ or _ E _ _ _, with L in 1 or 4.

Let's try:

- L in position 4, E in position 3: _ _ E L S

Looking for valid words:
- L E _ _ S: ""LEGS"" is 4 letters, ""LEEPS"" has P (but double E), ""LEMON"" has O (invalid).
- E _ _ L S: ""EXELS"" (invalid), ""EULGS"" (invalid).
- _ _ E L S: ""BELLS"" has B (valid), ""FELLS"" (valid), ""WELLS"" (valid).

""BELLS"" seems good:
- B (new letter)
- E (position 2)
- L (position 3 - but from ROLES, L is not in position 3, so this would conflict)
Wait, ""BELLS"" has L in 3 - which conflicts with ROLES feedback (L(-) in position 3).

""FELLS"" - F, E, L, L, S:
- L in 3 and 4 - same issue.

""WELLS"" - same issue.

Alternative: L in position 4:

""PEELS"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions, maximizing the information I'll get from the feedback.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- A is NOT in the word.
- T is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, L, E (but none in their original positions).
- Does NOT contain A or T.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, L, E in different positions and avoids A and T. Let’s rearrange S, L, E while filling the remaining spots with new letters. Good candidates are consonants like R, N, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, O, U.

A strong next guess would be ""RISEN"":
- R (new letter)
- I (new vowel)
- S (moved from 1st to 3rd)
- E (moved from 5th to 4th)
- N (new letter)

This tests new letters while repositioning the known letters S, L, E (though we only show S here; we’d need to include L as well). A better word that includes L is ""LESIN"" (but that’s not a valid English word). Instead, ""SLEEK"" uses S, L, E but repeats E. ""SLEEP"" is invalid (A not allowed). ""SPREE"" has T not allowed. 

A valid word is ""SLEET"":
- S (position 1 → 3)
- L (position 2 → 2 – but L was in wrong position 2, so can’t be here)
- E (position 4 → 3)
- E (position 5 → 4)
- T (invalid, not in word)

""SLEET"" is invalid because T is excluded. Next, ""SLOPE"":
- S (1 → 1 – but S was in wrong position 1, so can’t be here)
- L (2 → 2 – but L was in wrong position 2, so can’t be here)
- O (new vowel)
- P (new letter)
- E (5 → 4)

This is flawed because S and L can’t stay in their original positions. Let’s try ""ELBOW"":
- E (5 → 1)
- L (2 → 2 – invalid)
- B (new)
- O (new)
- W (new)

""L can’t be in position 2."" 

Best valid word seems ""ROLES"":
- R (new)
- O (new)
- L (2 → 3)
- E (4 → 2)
- S (1 → 5)

This repositions S, L, E and introduces new letters. However, ""ROLES"" is good. Another is ""SLOPE"" but L is in 2 again. 

A valid word with S, L, E in new positions is ""SLEET"" (but T excluded). Instead, ""SLEEK"" is invalid (T excluded). 

Let’s use ""ROLES"" as it repositions L and E and introduces R, O.

But a better word is ""SLOPE"" – but L is in 2 again. 

Realizing the issue: we must move L away from position 2. Let’s try ""SLEET"" is invalid. 

Next best is ""SLEEK"" but T excluded. 

Alternative: ""SLEEP"" but P is new, but E repeats. 

Valid word: ""SLEPT"" – but T excluded. 

""SLEEK"" is invalid. 

""ELDER"" – but D, R new, E in 5 → 1, L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""OLDER"" – O, D, R new, L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""LOWER"" – L in 2 → 2 (invalid). 

""LOWER"" invalid. 

""ELBOW"" invalid (L in 2). 

""ROLES"" is valid:
- R (new)
- O (new)
- L (2 → 3)
- E (4 → 2)
- S (1 → 5)

This works. Let’s use ROLES.Based on the feedback, S, L, and E are in the word but in wrong positions, while A and T are not. I'll try a word that repositions these letters and introduces new common letters:
