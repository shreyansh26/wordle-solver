For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's structure.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. The combination can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters we still need to place: A, S.
- A cannot be in position 1.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We should now look for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Some candidate words:
- STASH (but has H, which wasn’t tested yet)
- SALSA (but has L and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)
- SNACK (but has N, C, K and E is excluded)
- SLANT (but has L, N, T and E is excluded)
- SADAS (but has D and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)

A better candidate is ""STAIN"" but it has I and N which weren't tested yet. However, we know A must be present and S must be present, and positions matter.

Another good candidate is ""STASH"" – it has S, T, A, S, H. But it has two S's and H isn't tested yet. Also S is in position 4 which is invalid.

A better word is ""STAIN"" – S, T, A, I, N. This has S, A, and avoids R, O, E. S is in position 1 (valid), A is in position 3 (valid). T, I, N are new letters to test.

But let me think of a word with A and S in different positions. ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y – but Y isn't tested yet and S is in position 1 (valid), A in position 2 (valid). This seems good.

However, ""STAIN"" might be better as it tests T, I, N which are common letters.

After considering, ""STAIN"" seems like the best next guess as it introduces new common letters while respecting the constraints.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's structure.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. The combination can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters we still need to place: A, S.
- A cannot be in position 1.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We should now look for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Some candidate words:
- STASH (but has H, which wasn’t tested yet)
- SALSA (but has L and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)
- SNACK (but has N, C, K and E is excluded)
- SLANT (but has L, N, T and E is excluded)
- SADAS (but has D and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)

A better candidate is ""STAIN"" but it has I and N which weren't tested yet. However, we know A must be present and S must be present, and positions matter.

Another good candidate is ""STASH"" – it has S, T, A, S, H. But it has two S's and H isn't tested yet. Also S is in position 4 which is invalid.

A better word is ""STAIN"" – S, T, A, I, N. This has S, A, and avoids R, O, E. S is in position 1 (valid), A is in position 3 (valid). T, I, N are new letters to test.

But let me think of a word with A and S in different positions. ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y – but Y isn't tested yet and S is in position 1 (valid), A in position 2 (valid). This seems good.

However, ""STAIN"" might be better as it tests T, I, N which are common letters.

After considering, ""STAIN"" seems like the best next guess as it introduces new common letters while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback that A and S are in the word but not in their original positions, and R, O, E are not in the word, I'll try a new guess:

From the new feedback on STAIN:

- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Exact letters and positions: S _ A _ _
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E, T, I, N
- Letters already confirmed: S, A
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has A in position 3
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N

Possible patterns: S _ A _ _

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern:
- SCAMP (but has M and P, and P is at position 5 which might be okay)
- SCARF (but has R and F)
- SALAD (but has L and D, and second A)
- SAMBA (but has M, B, and second A)
- SABOT (but has B, O, T)
- SCAMP (already considered)
- SAGAR (but has G, R)
- SALSA (but has L, S, second A)
- SCARF (already considered)
- SCAMP seems the best so far: S C A M P

Let me check if SCAMP meets all criteria:
- Starts with S: yes
- A in position 3: yes
- No R, O, E, T, I, N: yes (letters are S, C, A, M, P)
- All letters are valid and not excluded
- Common word: yes

Therefore, SCAMP is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that S is in position 1 and A is in position 3, and excluding the letters R, O, E, T, I, N, I'll try:

Thus, the only valid word fitting the constraints is SMALL.

Check SMALL:
- S M A L L
- S (✓) position 1
- M in position 2 (allowed, since M is in word but not in position 4)
- A (✓) position 3
- L and L - not excluded
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Therefore, SMALL is the logical next guess.

- A(✓) 3rd letter – locked in place.
- L(✓) 4th letter – locked in place.
- L(-) 5th letter – the letter L is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  Since we already have L in the 4th position, the 5th letter must be something else entirely.

So the pattern is now: S M A L _

Letters already excluded (from any position):
R, O, E, T, I, N, C, P, and now the final L is also excluded from position 5.

Letters still allowed for the 5th position (not yet excluded and not already placed):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any others not listed above).

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with “SMAL” and ends with one of those letters.  
The only common word that fits is “SMALL,” but we’ve already ruled out the second L for position 5.  
Looking through the remaining letters, “SMALT” (a historical glass pigment) and “SMALY” (rare) are not standard dictionaries.  
The only remaining valid dictionary word is “SMALT” (sometimes spelled “smaltz”), but it’s obscure.

However, the next most common and valid word is “SMALL,” which we’ve already tried.  
Given the constraints, the only remaining plausible letter that forms a recognized word is “K,” making “SMALK” impossible, or “SMALD” (a type of glass) which is also obscure.

Rechecking standard dictionaries, the only standard English word that fits the pattern S M A L _ is “SMALL,” but we’ve already used it and the final L is excluded.  
Therefore, the next best candidate must be “SMALT,” even though it’s less common.

But upon deeper reflection, the word “SMALT” is indeed recognized in major dictionaries (e.g., Merriam-Webster as a variant spelling).  
Thus, SMALT is the logical next guess.

However, if we strictly require a more common word, we might reconsider.  
Upon re-evaluation, the only remaining common word that fits is actually “SMALL,” but since we know the final letter isn’t L, we must accept that no standard word remains except “SMALT.”

Therefore, the correct and only remaining guess is:

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help narrow down possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word's structure.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

Let me think through why this is a good first guess:
1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. The combination can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters we still need to place: A, S.
- A cannot be in position 1.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We should now look for a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does not contain R, O, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Some candidate words:
- STASH (but has H, which wasn’t tested yet)
- SALSA (but has L and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)
- SNACK (but has N, C, K and E is excluded)
- SLANT (but has L, N, T and E is excluded)
- SADAS (but has D and second A, and S in position 4 is invalid)

A better candidate is ""STAIN"" but it has I and N which weren't tested yet. However, we know A must be present and S must be present, and positions matter.

Another good candidate is ""STASH"" – it has S, T, A, S, H. But it has two S's and H isn't tested yet. Also S is in position 4 which is invalid.

A better word is ""STAIN"" – S, T, A, I, N. This has S, A, and avoids R, O, E. S is in position 1 (valid), A is in position 3 (valid). T, I, N are new letters to test.

But let me think of a word with A and S in different positions. ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y – but Y isn't tested yet and S is in position 1 (valid), A in position 2 (valid). This seems good.

However, ""STAIN"" might be better as it tests T, I, N which are common letters.

After considering, ""STAIN"" seems like the best next guess as it introduces new common letters while respecting the constraints.Based on the feedback that A and S are in the word but not in their original positions, and R, O, E are not in the word, I'll try a new guess:

- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Exact letters and positions: S _ A _ _
- Letters to exclude: R, O, E, T, I, N
- Letters already confirmed: S, A
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has A in position 3
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, I, N

Possible patterns: S _ A _ _

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern:
- SCAMP (but has M and P, and P is at position 5 which might be okay)
- SCARF (but has R and F)
- SALAD (but has L and D, and second A)
- SAMBA (but has M, B, and second A)
- SABOT (but has B, O, T)
- SCAMP (already considered)
- SAGAR (but has G, R)
- SALSA (but has L, S, second A)
- SCARF (already considered)
- SCAMP seems the best so far: S C A M P

Let me check if SCAMP meets all criteria:
- Starts with S: yes
- A in position 3: yes
- No R, O, E, T, I, N: yes (letters are S, C, A, M, P)
- All letters are valid and not excluded
- Common word: yes

Therefore, SCAMP is a good next guess.Based on the feedback that S is in position 1 and A is in position 3, and excluding the letters R, O, E, T, I, N, I'll try:

2. Letters to exclude (x or - in any position):
   - C, P, T, I, N, R, O, E, M (because M is in the word but not in position 4)

3. Pattern so far: S _ A _ _

4. Letters still allowed (not yet excluded and not fixed):
   - B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed above)

5. M is in the word but not in position 4, so M must be in position 2 or 5.

1. S M A _ _
   - SMARM (but R is excluded)
   - SMACK (C is excluded)
   - SMALL (L is allowed, second L is okay)
   - SMARM is invalid (R excluded)
   - SMACK invalid (C excluded)
   - SMALL: S M A L L - letters are S, M, A, L, L - no excluded letters, M is in position 2 (allowed), L is allowed
   - SMELL: S M E L L - E is excluded
   - So SMALL seems valid

2. S _ A _ M
   - S B A R M - R excluded
   - S L A B M - not a word
   - S H A R M - R excluded
   - S K A R M - R excluded
   - S F A R M - R excluded
   - S G A R M - R excluded
   - S V A R M - R excluded
   - S D A R M - R excluded
   - S W A R M - R excluded
   - S B A R M - R excluded
   - S H A R M - R excluded
   - S K A R M - R excluded
   - S L A R M - R excluded
   - S P A R M - P is excluded
   - S M A R M - R excluded
   - S C A R M - C is excluded
   - S G A R M - R excluded
   - S B A R M - R excluded
   - S H A R M - R excluded
   - S K A R M - R excluded
   - S L A R M - R excluded
   - S V A R M - R excluded
   - S W A R M - R excluded
   - S X A R M - R excluded
   - S Y A R M - R excluded
   - S Z A R M - R excluded
   - None seem valid

Thus, the only valid word fitting the constraints is SMALL.

Check SMALL:
- S M A L L
- S (✓) position 1
- M in position 2 (allowed, since M is in word but not in position 4)
- A (✓) position 3
- L and L - not excluded

  Since we already have L in the 4th position, the 5th letter must be something else entirely.

So the pattern is now: S M A L _

Letters already excluded (from any position):
R, O, E, T, I, N, C, P, and now the final L is also excluded from position 5.

Letters still allowed for the 5th position (not yet excluded and not already placed):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any others not listed above).

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with “SMAL” and ends with one of those letters.  
The only common word that fits is “SMALL,” but we’ve already ruled out the second L for position 5.  
Looking through the remaining letters, “SMALT” (a historical glass pigment) and “SMALY” (rare) are not standard dictionaries.  
The only remaining valid dictionary word is “SMALT” (sometimes spelled “smaltz”), but it’s obscure.

However, the next most common and valid word is “SMALL,” which we’ve already tried.  
Given the constraints, the only remaining plausible letter that forms a recognized word is “K,” making “SMALK” impossible, or “SMALD” (a type of glass) which is also obscure.

Rechecking standard dictionaries, the only standard English word that fits the pattern S M A L _ is “SMALL,” but we’ve already used it and the final L is excluded.  
Therefore, the next best candidate must be “SMALT,” even though it’s less common.

But upon deeper reflection, the word “SMALT” is indeed recognized in major dictionaries (e.g., Merriam-Webster as a variant spelling).  
Thus, SMALT is the logical next guess.

However, if we strictly require a more common word, we might reconsider.  
Upon re-evaluation, the only remaining common word that fits is actually “SMALL,” but since we know the final letter isn’t L, we must accept that no standard word remains except “SMALT.”

Therefore, the correct and only remaining guess is:

SMALT

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can reveal a lot about the secret word\'s structure.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.\n\nLet me think through why this is a good first guess:\n1. Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words\n2. Contains 2 very common consonants (R, S)\n3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English\n4. The combination can help identify which vowels are present and their positions\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.\n- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.\n- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.\n- Letters we still need to place: A, S.\n- A cannot be in position 1.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n\nWe should now look for a 5-letter word that:\n1.

T, I, N are new letters to test.\n\nBut let me think of a word with A and S in different positions. ""SALTY"" has S, A, L, T, Y – but Y isn\'t tested yet and S is in position 1 (valid), A in position 2 (valid).

- The 5th letter is NOT T (just like the 5th letter is NOT L from SMALL).
