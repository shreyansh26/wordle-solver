### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced choice that tests multiple vowels and common consonants.

- Positions ruled out:
  – R cannot be elsewhere (already fixed at 3)

From TRIBE: E was in position 5 (feedback E(-)), so position 5 is ruled out for E.
From NERDY: E was in position 2 (feedback E(-)), so position 2 is ruled out for E.
Thus E can only be in 1 or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced choice that tests multiple vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not A, O, or S.
- R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps R and E in different positions.
2. Avoids A, O, S.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to test new letters.

Good candidates: TRIBE, DRIVE, FRESH, CRONE, etc.

TRIBE:
- T (new letter)
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- I (new vowel)
- B (new letter)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 5)

This tests new letters T, I, B while repositioning R and E.

Another option: CRANE (but A is excluded), or PRIDE.

I'll go with TRIBE as it covers new letters efficiently.

So far we have:

- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I, B  
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E (both confirmed, but neither is in its current position)

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) or position 2 again (from TRIBE) — so R must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or position 5 again (from TRIBE) — so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We still need to test other common consonants (N, L, C, D, etc.) and the remaining vowels (U, Y).  
A good next word would place R and E in new spots while introducing fresh letters.

Candidate: “NERDY”
- N (new)
- E (now in position 2)
- R (now in position 3)
- D (new)
- Y (new)

This tests N, D, Y and gives new home addresses for R and E.

From Guess 4 (LURED) we now know the exact word:

- L(x) → L is not in the word.  
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in position 2.  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 3.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 4.  
- D(✓) → D is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is now fully determined:  
Position 1: unknown (but we know it must be a letter not yet ruled out).  
Position 2: U  
Position 3: R  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: D  

Letters already ruled out include: A, O, S, T, I, B, N, Y, L.  
We still need a valid 5-letter word that matches the pattern _ U R E D.

The only common English word that fits is:

C U R E D → CURED (though ""cured"" is the more standard spelling, ""cur ed"" is listed in some dictionaries).  
However, the more widely recognized spelling is ""CURED"".

Let’s verify:  
C is not yet ruled out, U is confirmed at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.  
""CURED"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the correct next guess is ""CURED"".
