For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words
- It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while placing R and S in different positions. Good candidates are words like:
- TRUST (but U is less common)
- DRIPS (but P is less common)
- FIRST (but F is less common)

A better choice is ""FIRST"" because:
- It re-uses R in position 3 (allowed since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- It introduces F, I, and T (all common letters)
- It keeps S out of position 4
- It avoids A, O, E entirely

However, ""DRIPS"" might be better because it introduces D and P while keeping R and S in new positions. But ""DRIPS"" has P which is less common.

A more balanced choice is ""TRIPS"":
- T, I, P are common
- R is in position 2 (allowed since original R was in position 2 and marked -, so position 2 is now known to be wrong, but we can test R elsewhere)
- S is in position 5 (different from original position 4)

Actually, since R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", position 2 is now known to be wrong, so R should be tested elsewhere. Similarly, S was in position 4 and marked ""-"", so position 4 is wrong.

Let me choose ""TRIPS"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (but we know from feedback that R is not in position 2, so this is bad)

Better: ""STIRP"":
- S: in position 1 (was in 4 before, now new position)
- T: new letter
- I: new vowel
- R: in position 3 (new position)
- P: new letter

But ""STIRP"" is not a common word. A better common word is ""TRIPS"" with R in position 2 - but we know R is not in position 2.

Next option: ""CRISP"":
- C: new letter
- R: in position 2 (again, same issue)

Better: ""SPRIT"":
- S: position 1
- P: new
- R: position 3
- I: new
- T: new

""SPRIT"" is a valid word and tests S in position 1, R in position 3, and introduces P, I, T.

But maybe even simpler: ""FIRST"" - but R is in position 2 which we know is wrong.

Wait, let's think differently: since R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4, we can try placing them in positions 1, 3, or 5.

A good word would be ""SPLIT"":
- S: position 1 (new)
- P: new
- L: new
- I: new
- T: new

But this doesn't use R at all. We know R is in the word, so we must include R.

Best next guess: ""STIRP"" is not common. ""TRIPS"" has R in position 2 which we know is wrong. ""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 which is also wrong.

Alternative: ""WRIST"":
- W: new
- R: position 2 (still wrong position)
- I: new
- S: position 4 (still wrong position)
- T: new

This is worse.

Better: ""CRISP"" - R in position 2 (still wrong).

Next idea: use a word with R in position 1 or 3 or 5, and S in position 1, 3, or 5.

A good candidate is ""STIRP"" but it's uncommon. ""TRIPS"" is common but R is in position 2.

Wait, let's try ""FIRST"" - even though R is in position 2, the feedback will confirm if R is in position 2 again (which we know it's not), but we can still learn more letters.

But to maximize information, let's choose ""STIRP"" - but it's not a valid word. Actually, ""STIRP"" is valid (a narrow strip), but let's use a more common word.

""STIRP"" is actually valid, but let's use ""TRIPS"" and accept that R will be in position 2 (which we know is wrong), but this gives us more info on other letters.

Actually, better to avoid position 2 for R. Let's try ""SPRIT"" - S in position 1, R in position 3, and test P, I, T.

""SPRIT"" is a valid word and uses R in position 3 (new position) and S in position 1 (new position), while introducing P, I, T.

This seems optimal.

Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, I'll test new positions for R and S while introducing other common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English 5-letter words
- It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are in the word but in the wrong position.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2
- O: x → not in the word
- S: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: x → not in the word

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels while placing R and S in different positions. Good candidates are words like:
- TRUST (but U is less common)
- DRIPS (but P is less common)
- FIRST (but F is less common)

A better choice is ""FIRST"" because:
- It re-uses R in position 3 (allowed since feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- It introduces F, I, and T (all common letters)
- It keeps S out of position 4
- It avoids A, O, E entirely

However, ""DRIPS"" might be better because it introduces D and P while keeping R and S in new positions. But ""DRIPS"" has P which is less common.

A more balanced choice is ""TRIPS"":
- T, I, P are common
- R is in position 2 (allowed since original R was in position 2 and marked -, so position 2 is now known to be wrong, but we can test R elsewhere)
- S is in position 5 (different from original position 4)

Actually, since R was in position 2 and marked ""-"", position 2 is now known to be wrong, so R should be tested elsewhere. Similarly, S was in position 4 and marked ""-"", so position 4 is wrong.

Let me choose ""TRIPS"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (but we know from feedback that R is not in position 2, so this is bad)

Better: ""STIRP"":
- S: in position 1 (was in 4 before, now new position)
- T: new letter
- I: new vowel
- R: in position 3 (new position)
- P: new letter

But ""STIRP"" is not a common word. A better common word is ""TRIPS"" with R in position 2 - but we know R is not in position 2.

Next option: ""CRISP"":
- C: new letter
- R: in position 2 (again, same issue)

Better: ""SPRIT"":
- S: position 1
- P: new
- R: position 3
- I: new
- T: new

""SPRIT"" is a valid word and tests S in position 1, R in position 3, and introduces P, I, T.

But maybe even simpler: ""FIRST"" - but R is in position 2 which we know is wrong.

Wait, let's think differently: since R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4, we can try placing them in positions 1, 3, or 5.

A good word would be ""SPLIT"":
- S: position 1 (new)
- P: new
- L: new
- I: new
- T: new

But this doesn't use R at all. We know R is in the word, so we must include R.

Best next guess: ""STIRP"" is not common. ""TRIPS"" has R in position 2 which we know is wrong. ""DRIPS"" has R in position 2 which is also wrong.

Alternative: ""WRIST"":
- W: new
- R: position 2 (still wrong position)
- I: new
- S: position 4 (still wrong position)
- T: new

This is worse.

Better: ""CRISP"" - R in position 2 (still wrong).

Next idea: use a word with R in position 1 or 3 or 5, and S in position 1, 3, or 5.

A good candidate is ""STIRP"" but it's uncommon. ""TRIPS"" is common but R is in position 2.

Wait, let's try ""FIRST"" - even though R is in position 2, the feedback will confirm if R is in position 2 again (which we know it's not), but we can still learn more letters.

But to maximize information, let's choose ""STIRP"" - but it's not a valid word. Actually, ""STIRP"" is valid (a narrow strip), but let's use a more common word.

""STIRP"" is actually valid, but let's use ""TRIPS"" and accept that R will be in position 2 (which we know is wrong), but this gives us more info on other letters.

Actually, better to avoid position 2 for R. Let's try ""SPRIT"" - S in position 1, R in position 3, and test P, I, T.

""SPRIT"" is a valid word and uses R in position 3 (new position) and S in position 1 (new position), while introducing P, I, T.

This seems optimal.Based on the feedback that R and S are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively, I'll test new positions for R and S while introducing other common letters.

From the latest feedback:

RISKY → R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓) Y(x)

- R is in position 1 (✓)
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 3 (✓)
- K is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is not in the word (x)

So the secret word is now fully determined:

Position 1: R
Position 2: I
Position 3: S
Position 4: K
Position 5: ?

We only need to find the 5th letter. We know the word does not contain A, O, E, P, T, Y. Allowed letters for position 5 are any remaining consonants or vowels not yet excluded.

Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with RISK, the most common ending is ""RISK + B"" → RISK B is not a word, but ""RISKY"" is. Since Y is excluded, we need another common letter.

Possible words:
- RISK + N → RISKN? Not valid.
- RISK + T → RISK T? T is excluded.
- RISK + S → RISKS? But S is already in position 3 and we don't know if it repeats.
- RISK + E → RISKE? E is excluded.
- RISK + O → RISKO? O is excluded.
- RISK + A → RISKA? A is excluded.

Looking at the remaining letters, let's think of common letters that fit. The word must be R I S K _.

Possible candidates:
- RISK B → Not a word.
- RISK D → RISKD? Not a word.
- RISK F → RISKF? Not a word.
- RISK G → RISKG? Not a word.
- RISK H → RISKH? Not a word.
- RISK L → RISK L? Not a word.
- RISK M → RISK M? Not a word.
- RISK N → RISK N? Not a word.
- RISK S → RISKS? This is a valid word (though implies S is repeated, which is allowed).
- RISK T → T is excluded.
- RISK U → RISKU? Not a word.
- RISK V → RISKV? Not a word.
- RISK W → RISKW? Not a word.
- RISK X → RISKX? Not a word.
- RISK Z → RISKZ? Not a word.

The only valid word seems to be RISKS. However, this would mean S is in position 5, but we already have S in position 3. The problem doesn't prohibit repeated letters, so this is possible.

But let's double-check if there are other possible letters. Maybe we missed a common word.

Another approach: think of words that fit RISK_ and are 5 letters. The only common ones are:
- RISKY (invalid, Y excluded)
- RISKS (valid, but S repeats)
- RISK + another letter.

Looking at the remaining letters, let's consider D: RISKD? Not a word. N: RISKN? Not a word. S: RISKS. 

Given this, RISKS seems to be the only possible word. However, since K is in position 4 and we have RISK_, the 5th letter must be a consonant not yet excluded. 

Wait, let's check if there's another word. Maybe RISK + B is not a word, but RISK + another letter. 

Actually, ""RISK"" is a prefix, and the 5th letter must be such that the whole word is valid. The only valid word I can think of is RISKS. 

But let me verify: RISKS is a valid 5-letter word meaning to take a risk again. It fits all constraints:
- R I S K S
- No forbidden letters (A, O, E, P, T, Y)
- S is allowed to repeat if the word allows it.

Since this seems to be the only possible word, we'll go with RISKS.

The latest feedback shows that the first four letters are exactly RISK. We only need to determine the fifth letter. After eliminating all previously ruled-out letters (A, O, E, P, T, Y), the only remaining common letter that forms a valid 5-letter word starting with RISK is S.
