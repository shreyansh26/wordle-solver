2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes two very common vowels (A, E) and three very common consonants (S, L, T). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one letter in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities effectively.

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE as my first guess.

Another option is CRANK:

- A in position 3 would conflict, but here A is in position 3 – so this is bad.

DRAIN:
- D, R, A, I, N – A in position 3 is invalid.

RAINB:
- A in position 3 is invalid.

RADIO:
- A in position 3 is invalid.

RAISE:
- Contains S and E, which are excluded.

RANCH:
- A in position 3 is invalid.

RADIO:
- A in position 3 is invalid.

RAIN:
- Only 4 letters, not 5.

RAINY seems best among 5-letter options.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RAINY -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE  
S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
→ Word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.  
→ Word DOES contain A, but A is NOT in position 3.

Guess 2: RAINY  
R(x) A(✓) I(-) N(-) Y(x)  
→ Word does NOT contain R, Y.  
→ Word DOES contain A, and A is in position 2 (because A got ✓ in slot 2).  
→ Word also contains I and N, but both are in wrong positions (I not in 3, N not in 4).

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (fixed at position 2), I, N.  
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, R, Y.  
- Positions still unknown: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but A is locked at 2).

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ A _ _ _  
and must include I and N somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5, while avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels left: O, U (since A is used, and I is already present).

Let’s try to place I and N in new spots.  
If we put I in position 1, N could be in 3,4, or 5.  
If we put I in position 3, N could be in 1,4, or 5.  
Etc.

A simple candidate that fits:  
C A N I D  
- A at 2 ✓  
- Contains I and N ✓  
- No excluded letters ✓  
- Common word ✓  

Another candidate:  
M A I N D  
But N would be at 4 (allowed), I at 3 (allowed), etc.  

CANID seems slightly better because C and D are common consonants.

Let’s go with CANID.

Current constraints after three guesses:

1. A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _
2. N is in the word and is in position 3 (from CANID feedback: N(✓)).
3. I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from CANID feedback: I(-)).
4. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, Y, C, D.
5. Remaining positions to fill: 1, 4, 5.
6. Remaining letters to place: I (must go in 1 or 5), plus any other allowed consonants or vowels.

Allowed letters now:
- Vowels: O, U (A is used, I is present)
- Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

From point 3, I cannot be in position 4, and position 3 is N, position 2 is A. So I must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try:
- Position 1: I
- Position 4 and 5: need two more letters from allowed set, forming a valid word.

Possible word: I A N _ _
But position 3 is N, so I A N _ _ doesn't fit (N is already at 3).

Wait, the pattern is _ A N _ _ (since N is at 3).

So we have: _ A N _ _
I must be in position 1 or 5.

Option 1: I A N _ _
But that would be I A N _ _, which is 5 letters: I A N _ _ → positions 1,2,3: I A N. Then positions 4,5 need letters.

Possible: I A N G O → IANGO (but not a valid word)
I A N K O → IANKO (invalid)
I A N G O → invalid
I A N G U → IANGU (invalid)

Option 2: _ A N _ I
Positions 1,4,5: need letters, with I at 5.

Possible: B A N K I → BAN KI (but K is allowed, B is allowed)
Check if BAN KI is a valid word: yes, ""banki"" is a variant spelling of ""bun"" in some contexts, but might not be valid.
Alternatively: G A N G I → GANGI (invalid)
F A N G I → FANGI (invalid)
M A N G I → MANGI (valid word meaning ""to eat"" in some languages)

But ""MANGI"" is valid and fits:
- M (allowed)
- A (fixed)
- N (fixed at 3)
- G (allowed)
- I (fixed at 5)

Check constraints:
- Contains I and N ✓
- A at 2 ✓
- N at 3 ✓
- I at 5 (not at 4) ✓
- No excluded letters ✓

Thus, MANGI is a valid next guess.
