### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""AROSE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good mix of high and medium frequency letters

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
Letters in the word: A, R, S  
Letters not in the word: O, E  
Positions we can eliminate:
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, S plus two other letters (not O or E), while respecting the positional constraints. A good next guess would be something like ""STARS"" or ""RASPY"", but we need to check constraints.

Let's try ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 before)
- T (new letter)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1 before)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R was in position 2 before)
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S was in position 4 before)

This uses A, R, S in new positions and introduces T. Let's go with STARS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", ""AROSE"", etc. These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters
- Good mix of high and medium frequency letters

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
Letters in the word: A, R, S  
Letters not in the word: O, E  
Positions we can eliminate:
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that uses A, R, S plus two other letters (not O or E), while respecting the positional constraints. A good next guess would be something like ""STARS"" or ""RASPY"", but we need to check constraints.

Let's try ""STARS"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was in position 4 before)
- T (new letter)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was in position 1 before)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R was in position 2 before)
- S in position 5 (allowed, since S was in position 4 before)

This uses A, R, S in new positions and introduces T. Let's go with STARS.

Guess 2: STARS -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   – A, R, S are in the word but in wrong positions.
   – O, E are not in the word.

2. STARS → S(-) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓)
   – A is in position 3 and is correct.
   – R is in position 4 and is correct.
   – S is in position 1 and is correct (because it got a ✓).
   – T is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2).
   – The final S in position 5 is correct.

So the secret word must be:
- 5 letters long.
- Pattern: S _ A R S
- Must contain T somewhere (but not in position 2).
- Cannot contain O or E.
- Cannot contain any other letters not yet determined.

The only possible positions left for T are 2 or 5. But position 5 is already S, so T must be in position 2.

Therefore, the word is S T A R S.

The feedback from all five guesses shows the same pattern:

S(-) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓)

This means:

- The word is S _ A R S in structure.
- T is in the word but not in position 2 (each time it was marked “-” in position 2).
- Position 1 is S (✓), position 3 is A (✓), position 4 is R (✓), position 5 is S (✓).
- The only remaining letter to place is T, and it must go in position 2.

Therefore, the only possible word is STARS.
