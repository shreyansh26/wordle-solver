For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities at once. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

Common 5-letter words avoiding A, R, S, E and with O elsewhere:
- DOUGH (but has U and H, not sure)
- POINT (but has I, N, T - let's see)
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T - but O is 2nd, which is allowed)
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D - O is 3rd, which is not allowed)

""POINT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""DOUGH"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""MOUNT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.

Current constraints:
1. Must contain O (and it is now known to be in the 2nd position).
2. Must contain T (from POINT feedback: T(-) – letter exists but is in wrong position).
3. Must NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N.

So the pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T which must appear somewhere.

We know T is in the word but not in the 5th position (from POINT feedback). So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:

- _ O T _ _

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words that fit:
- T O _ _ _: TOWER, TODAY (but A is banned), TONGS (S banned), TOPIC (I banned) → TOWER seems valid.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH, DOTTY, HOTEL, MOTEL, WOTAN (but A banned) → HOTEL, MOTEL look good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT, DOGOT, FOGOT, LOGOT, MOBOT, VOGOT – most have O in 2nd and T in 4th, but need to check validity.

Valid candidates: TOWER, HOTEL, MOTEL, LOGOT, etc.

Let’s pick TOWER:
- T O W E R – but E is banned, so TOWER is invalid (E is in it).
Next, HOTEL:
- H O T E L – E is banned.
Next, MOTEL:
- M O T E L – E is banned.

We need to avoid E entirely. Let’s look again:
- T O _ _ _: TONGS (S banned), TODAY (A banned), TOTEM (E banned), TOTED (E banned) – seems limited.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH (C and H are allowed), DOTTY (Y allowed), HOTEL (E banned), MOTEL (E banned) – BOTCH looks good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT (valid?), DOGOT (valid?), LOGOT (valid?), MOBOT (valid?), VOGOT (valid?) – need to check dictionary.

BOTCH is a valid word meaning to damage or spoil. It fits:
- B O T C H
- Contains O in 2nd position (✓), T in 3rd position (allowed), and avoids all banned letters.

Thus, BOTCH is a strong next guess.

Let's summarize the constraints gathered so far:

1. Position 2 must be O (from POINT and BOTCH feedback).
2. T must appear somewhere in the word (from POINT and BOTCH feedback), but NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   - Therefore T must be in position 1 or 4.
3. H must appear in the word (from BOTCH feedback) and it is NOT in position 5 (since BOTCH had H in position 5 and got H(✓)).
   - So H must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.
5. Letters still allowed: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T and H which must appear.

Possible patterns:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 4: _ O _ T _

And H must be in position 3 or (if T is in 1) 4.

Let's explore both cases:

Case 1: T in position 1 (T O _ _ _)
   - Then H must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Possible: T O H _ _ or T O _ H _
   - Need two more letters (not in banned list).
   - Examples: TOUGH (U, G allowed), TOTEM (E banned), TOUGH is valid (U, G not banned).

Case 2: T in position 4 (_ O _ T _)
   - Then H must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Possible: H O _ T _ or _ O H T _
   - Examples: HOMER (E banned), HOSTS (S banned), HOIST (I banned), HOTEL (E banned), MOTEL (E banned) – seems limited.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities at once. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

Common 5-letter words avoiding A, R, S, E and with O elsewhere:
- DOUGH (but has U and H, not sure)
- POINT (but has I, N, T - let's see)
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T - but O is 2nd, which is allowed)
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D - O is 3rd, which is not allowed)
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D - O is 2nd, allowed)

""POINT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""DOUGH"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""MOUNT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.

Among these, ""POINT"" seems like a good choice as it introduces new common letters (P, I, N, T) to test.

Current constraints:
1. Must contain O (and it is now known to be in the 2nd position).
2. Must contain T (from POINT feedback: T(-) – letter exists but is in wrong position).
3. Must NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N.

So the pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T which must appear somewhere.

We know T is in the word but not in the 5th position (from POINT feedback). So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- T O _ _ _
- _ O T _ _
- _ O _ T _

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words that fit:
- T O _ _ _: TOWER, TODAY (but A is banned), TONGS (S banned), TOPIC (I banned) → TOWER seems valid.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH, DOTTY, HOTEL, MOTEL, WOTAN (but A banned) → HOTEL, MOTEL look good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT, DOGOT, FOGOT, LOGOT, MOBOT, VOGOT – most have O in 2nd and T in 4th, but need to check validity.

Valid candidates: TOWER, HOTEL, MOTEL, LOGOT, etc.

Let’s pick TOWER:
- T O W E R – but E is banned, so TOWER is invalid (E is in it).
Next, HOTEL:
- H O T E L – E is banned.
Next, MOTEL:
- M O T E L – E is banned.

We need to avoid E entirely. Let’s look again:
- T O _ _ _: TONGS (S banned), TODAY (A banned), TOTEM (E banned), TOTED (E banned) – seems limited.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH (C and H are allowed), DOTTY (Y allowed), HOTEL (E banned), MOTEL (E banned) – BOTCH looks good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT (valid?), DOGOT (valid?), LOGOT (valid?), MOBOT (valid?), VOGOT (valid?) – need to check dictionary.

BOTCH is a valid word meaning to damage or spoil. It fits:
- B O T C H
- Contains O in 2nd position (✓), T in 3rd position (allowed), and avoids all banned letters.

Thus, BOTCH is a strong next guess.

Possible patterns:

And H must be in position 3 or (if T is in 1) 4.

Let's explore both cases:

Case 1: T in position 1 (T O _ _ _)
   - Then H must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Possible: T O H _ _ or T O _ H _
   - Need two more letters (not in banned list).
   - Examples: TOUGH (U, G allowed), TOTEM (E banned), TOUGH is valid (U, G not banned).

Case 2: T in position 4 (_ O _ T _)
   - Then H must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Possible: H O _ T _ or _ O H T _

From these, the most promising valid word seems TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, H in 3, U and G allowed).Based on the feedback, we know:

- T must appear (but not in positions 3 or 5), so T is in 1 or 4.
- H must appear (but not in position 5), so H is in 1, 3, or 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

Let's extract the new information from the latest feedback:

TOUGH → T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(✓)

1. Position 2 is still O (✓).
2. Position 5 is H (✓), so H must be in position 5.
3. T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (since we got T(-) here).
4. U and G are NOT in the word (x).

Combining with earlier constraints:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = H
- T must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 3 or 4 (since 1 is now excluded for T, and 2,5 are taken).
- Forbidden letters now include U, G, plus previous bans: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ H, with T in either position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ O T _ H (T in 3)
- _ O _ T H (T in 4)

Letters still allowed: D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's look for valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

For _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- FOTCH (not a word)
- JOTTY (Y allowed, but T is in 3, H in 5) – but JOTTY has T in 3 and Y in 4, which is allowed.
- MOTCH (not a word)
- WOTCH (not a word)

For _ O _ T H:
- DOFTY (not a word)
- FOLLY (but L is allowed, Y allowed) – but FOLLY has no T.
- LOGIC (C banned)
- MOLLY (no T)
- VOTCH (not a word)

The only valid word fitting seems JOTTY (but T is in 3, which is allowed, and Y is allowed). However, JOTTY has J, O, T, T, Y – but we need 5 distinct positions? No, letters can repeat unless banned. But JOTTY has T twice, which might be okay.

But let's check if JOTTY is valid: JOTTY is a valid word meaning to jump or a nickname for Josephine.

Alternatively, looking again:
- _ O _ T H: Could be FOTTH (not a word), MOTTH (not a word).
- _ O T _ H: Could be DOTCH (C banned), FOTCH (not a word), JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems JOTTY is the closest.

Wait, JOTTY is J-O-T-T-Y, which has T in 3 and 4, but we only need one T. However, the word must have T in either 3 or 4, not necessarily only one T.

But JOTTY seems to fit the constraints:
- O in 2 (✓)
- H in 5 (✓)
- T in 3 (allowed)
- J and Y not banned.

But let's see if there's a better word. Another possibility is:
- _ O T _ H: Could be DOTCH (C banned), FOTCH (not a word), JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems JOTTY is the only valid word here.

However, JOTTY has T in both 3 and 4, which might not be necessary. Let's think of other words:

For _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems no other options.

For _ O _ T H:
- Could be FOLLY (no T), LOGIC (C banned), etc.

Actually, looking more carefully, the word must be _ O T _ H or _ O _ T H, with T in 3 or 4, and H in 5.

Let's try _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- FOTCH (not a word)
- JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – but JOTTY is J-O-T-T-Y, which has T in 3 and 4, but we only need T in 3 or 4. So JOTTY would have T in 3, which is allowed.

But is there a word with T in 4 and other letters? For example:
- _ O _ T H: Could be FOLLY (no T), LOGIC (C banned), etc.

Actually, the word ""FOGOT"" (past tense of fogo) exists, but O is in 2, T in 4, H in 5, but G is banned (from TOUGH feedback).

Another word: ""VOGOT"" – but G is banned.

""MOOTY"" – but T is in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""MOOTY"" has Y in 5, but H must be in 5, so this is invalid.

""LOTHY"" – but L, O, T, H, Y – but H is in 4, not 5.

""LOTHS"" – S banned.

""VOGUE"" – E banned.

""MOOTH"" – but H is in 5, T in 4, O in 2 – this seems valid:
- M O O T H – but O is repeated, and we have O in 2 (✓), T in 4 (allowed), H in 5 (✓). Letters: M, O, T, H – all allowed (M not banned, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5).

But MOOTH is a valid word (though rare, meaning to moan or wail).

But is there a more common word? Let's think:

""DOUGH"" – but G is banned.

""FOOTY"" – but T is in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""FOOTH"" – not a word.

""HOOTY"" – H in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""HOOTH"" – not a word.

""VOOTY"" – V in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""VOOTH"" – not a word.

""JOOTY"" – J in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""JOOTH"" – not a word.

""KOOTY"" – K in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""KOOTH"" – not a word.

""LOOTY"" – L in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""LOOTH"" – not a word.

""MOOTY"" – M in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""MOOTH"" – M in 1, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5 – this seems valid.

""NOOTY"" – N is banned.

""POOTY"" – P is banned.

""ROOTY"" – R is banned.

""SOOTY"" – S is banned.

""TOOTY"" – T is in 1, but T cannot be in 1 (from TOUGH feedback T(-)).

""WOOTY"" – W in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""WOOTH"" – W in 1, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5 – this seems valid.

Between MOOTH and WOOTH, both fit:
- MOOTH: M O O T H
- WOOTH: W O O T H

Both are valid, but MOOTH is more common as a word (though rare).

But let's check if there's a word with T in 4 and no double O:

_ O _ T H:
- Could be F O _ T H: FOLTH (not a word), FOWTH (not a word).
- Could be D O _ T H: DOLTH (not a word), DOMTH (not a word).
- Could be L O _ T H: LOLTH (not a word), LOMTH (not a word).
- Could be V O _ T H: VOLT? No, 5 letters.

Seems no common words here.

Thus, the best candidates are MOOTH or WOOTH, both fitting:
- O in 2 (✓)
- H in 5 (✓)
- T in 4 (allowed)
- No banned letters.

Between these, MOOTH is more likely the intended word.

But let's verify:
- MOOTH: M O O T H
  - M: allowed
  - O: allowed in 2
  - O: allowed in 3 (no restriction)
  - T: allowed in 4
  - H: allowed in 5
  - No banned letters.

Thus, MOOTH is a valid next guess.
</think>

From the latest feedback:
- Position 2 is O (✓)
- Position 5 is H (✓)
- T must appear (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), so T is in position 4
- Forbidden letters now include U, G, plus all previously banned letters

Pattern: _ O _ T H

The only common word fitting this is MOOTH (M-O-O-T-H).

<guess>MOOTH</guess>",MOOTH,"Let's extract the new information from the latest feedback:

TOUGH → T(-) O(✓) U(x) G(x) H(✓)

1. Position 2 is still O (✓).

- FOLLY (but L is allowed, Y allowed) – but FOLLY has no T.
- LOGIC (C banned)
- MOLLY (no T)
- VOTCH (not a word)

The only valid word fitting seems JOTTY (but T is in 3, which is allowed, and Y is allowed). However, JOTTY has J, O, T, T, Y – but we need 5 distinct positions? No, letters can repeat unless banned. But JOTTY has T twice, which might be okay.

Let's try _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- FOTCH (not a word)
- JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – but JOTTY is J-O-T-T-Y, which has T in 3 and 4, but we only need T in 3 or 4. So JOTTY would have T in 3, which is allowed.

But is there a word with T in 4 and other letters? For example:
- _ O _ T H: Could be FOLLY (no T), LOGIC (C banned), etc.

Actually, the word ""FOGOT"" (past tense of fogo) exists, but O is in 2, T in 4, H in 5, but G is banned (from TOUGH feedback).

Another word: ""VOGOT"" – but G is banned.

""MOOTY"" – but T is in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""MOOTY"" has Y in 5, but H must be in 5, so this is invalid.

Between MOOTH and WOOTH, both fit:
- MOOTH: M O O T H
- WOOTH: W O O T H

Both are valid, but MOOTH is more common as a word (though rare).

But let's check if there's a word with T in 4 and no double O:

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. These words use frequently occurring letters in English and help eliminate many possibilities at once. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

Common 5-letter words avoiding A, R, S, E and with O elsewhere:
- DOUGH (but has U and H, not sure)
- POINT (but has I, N, T - let's see)
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T - but O is 2nd, which is allowed)
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D - O is 3rd, which is not allowed)
- BOUND (B, O, U, N, D - O is 2nd, allowed)

""POINT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""DOUGH"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.
""MOUNT"" has O in 2nd position and avoids A, R, S, E.

Among these, ""POINT"" seems like a good choice as it introduces new common letters (P, I, N, T) to test.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
1. Must contain O (and it is now known to be in the 2nd position).
2. Must contain T (from POINT feedback: T(-) – letter exists but is in wrong position).
3. Must NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, I, N.

So the pattern so far: _ O _ _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding the banned ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T which must appear somewhere.

We know T is in the word but not in the 5th position (from POINT feedback). So T must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- T O _ _ _
- _ O T _ _
- _ O _ T _

Let’s brainstorm 5-letter words that fit:
- T O _ _ _: TOWER, TODAY (but A is banned), TONGS (S banned), TOPIC (I banned) → TOWER seems valid.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH, DOTTY, HOTEL, MOTEL, WOTAN (but A banned) → HOTEL, MOTEL look good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT, DOGOT, FOGOT, LOGOT, MOBOT, VOGOT – most have O in 2nd and T in 4th, but need to check validity.

Valid candidates: TOWER, HOTEL, MOTEL, LOGOT, etc.

Let’s pick TOWER:
- T O W E R – but E is banned, so TOWER is invalid (E is in it).
Next, HOTEL:
- H O T E L – E is banned.
Next, MOTEL:
- M O T E L – E is banned.

We need to avoid E entirely. Let’s look again:
- T O _ _ _: TONGS (S banned), TODAY (A banned), TOTEM (E banned), TOTED (E banned) – seems limited.
- _ O T _ _: BOTCH (C and H are allowed), DOTTY (Y allowed), HOTEL (E banned), MOTEL (E banned) – BOTCH looks good.
- _ O _ T _: COBUT (valid?), DOGOT (valid?), LOGOT (valid?), MOBOT (valid?), VOGOT (valid?) – need to check dictionary.

BOTCH is a valid word meaning to damage or spoil. It fits:
- B O T C H
- Contains O in 2nd position (✓), T in 3rd position (allowed), and avoids all banned letters.

Thus, BOTCH is a strong next guess.

Let's summarize the constraints gathered so far:

1. Position 2 must be O (from POINT and BOTCH feedback).
2. T must appear somewhere in the word (from POINT and BOTCH feedback), but NOT in positions 3 or 5.
   - Therefore T must be in position 1 or 4.
3. H must appear in the word (from BOTCH feedback) and it is NOT in position 5 (since BOTCH had H in position 5 and got H(✓)).
   - So H must be in position 1, 3, or 4.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.
5. Letters still allowed: D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus T and H which must appear.

Possible patterns:
- If T is in position 1: T O _ _ _
- If T is in position 4: _ O _ T _

And H must be in position 3 or (if T is in 1) 4.

Let's explore both cases:

Case 1: T in position 1 (T O _ _ _)
   - Then H must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Possible: T O H _ _ or T O _ H _
   - Need two more letters (not in banned list).
   - Examples: TOUGH (U, G allowed), TOTEM (E banned), TOUGH is valid (U, G not banned).

Case 2: T in position 4 (_ O _ T _)
   - Then H must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Possible: H O _ T _ or _ O H T _
   - Examples: HOMER (E banned), HOSTS (S banned), HOIST (I banned), HOTEL (E banned), MOTEL (E banned) – seems limited.

From these, the most promising valid word seems TOUGH (T in 1, O in 2, H in 3, U and G allowed).Based on the feedback, we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- T must appear (but not in positions 3 or 5), so T is in 1 or 4.
- H must appear (but not in position 5), so H is in 1, 3, or 4.
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

The word ""TOUGH"" fits:
- T in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (required), H in 3 (allowed), U and G not banned.

1. Position 2 is still O (✓).
2. Position 5 is H (✓), so H must be in position 5.
3. T is in the word but NOT in position 1 (since we got T(-) here).
4. U and G are NOT in the word (x).

Combining with earlier constraints:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = H
- T must appear somewhere, and the only remaining positions are 3 or 4 (since 1 is now excluded for T, and 2,5 are taken).
- Forbidden letters now include U, G, plus previous bans: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ H, with T in either position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- _ O T _ H (T in 3)
- _ O _ T H (T in 4)

Letters still allowed: D, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's look for valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

For _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- FOTCH (not a word)
- JOTTY (Y allowed, but T is in 3, H in 5) – but JOTTY has T in 3 and Y in 4, which is allowed.
- MOTCH (not a word)
- WOTCH (not a word)

For _ O _ T H:
- DOFTY (not a word)
- FOLLY (but L is allowed, Y allowed) – but FOLLY has no T.
- LOGIC (C banned)
- MOLLY (no T)
- VOTCH (not a word)

The only valid word fitting seems JOTTY (but T is in 3, which is allowed, and Y is allowed). However, JOTTY has J, O, T, T, Y – but we need 5 distinct positions? No, letters can repeat unless banned. But JOTTY has T twice, which might be okay.

But let's check if JOTTY is valid: JOTTY is a valid word meaning to jump or a nickname for Josephine.

Alternatively, looking again:
- _ O _ T H: Could be FOTTH (not a word), MOTTH (not a word).
- _ O T _ H: Could be DOTCH (C banned), FOTCH (not a word), JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems JOTTY is the closest.

Wait, JOTTY is J-O-T-T-Y, which has T in 3 and 4, but we only need one T. However, the word must have T in either 3 or 4, not necessarily only one T.

But JOTTY seems to fit the constraints:
- O in 2 (✓)
- H in 5 (✓)
- T in 3 (allowed)
- J and Y not banned.

But let's see if there's a better word. Another possibility is:
- _ O T _ H: Could be DOTCH (C banned), FOTCH (not a word), JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems JOTTY is the only valid word here.

However, JOTTY has T in both 3 and 4, which might not be necessary. Let's think of other words:

For _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – seems no other options.

For _ O _ T H:
- Could be FOLLY (no T), LOGIC (C banned), etc.

Actually, looking more carefully, the word must be _ O T _ H or _ O _ T H, with T in 3 or 4, and H in 5.

Let's try _ O T _ H:
- DOTCH (C banned)
- FOTCH (not a word)
- JOTTY (but T is in 3, H in 5) – but JOTTY is J-O-T-T-Y, which has T in 3 and 4, but we only need T in 3 or 4. So JOTTY would have T in 3, which is allowed.

But is there a word with T in 4 and other letters? For example:
- _ O _ T H: Could be FOLLY (no T), LOGIC (C banned), etc.

Actually, the word ""FOGOT"" (past tense of fogo) exists, but O is in 2, T in 4, H in 5, but G is banned (from TOUGH feedback).

Another word: ""VOGOT"" – but G is banned.

""MOOTY"" – but T is in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""MOOTY"" has Y in 5, but H must be in 5, so this is invalid.

""LOTHY"" – but L, O, T, H, Y – but H is in 4, not 5.

""LOTHS"" – S banned.

""VOGUE"" – E banned.

""MOOTH"" – but H is in 5, T in 4, O in 2 – this seems valid:
- M O O T H – but O is repeated, and we have O in 2 (✓), T in 4 (allowed), H in 5 (✓). Letters: M, O, T, H – all allowed (M not banned, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5).

But MOOTH is a valid word (though rare, meaning to moan or wail).

But is there a more common word? Let's think:

""DOUGH"" – but G is banned.

""FOOTY"" – but T is in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""FOOTH"" – not a word.

""HOOTY"" – H in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""HOOTH"" – not a word.

""VOOTY"" – V in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""VOOTH"" – not a word.

""JOOTY"" – J in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""JOOTH"" – not a word.

""KOOTY"" – K in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""KOOTH"" – not a word.

""LOOTY"" – L in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""LOOTH"" – not a word.

""MOOTY"" – M in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""MOOTH"" – M in 1, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5 – this seems valid.

""NOOTY"" – N is banned.

""POOTY"" – P is banned.

""ROOTY"" – R is banned.

""SOOTY"" – S is banned.

""TOOTY"" – T is in 1, but T cannot be in 1 (from TOUGH feedback T(-)).

""WOOTY"" – W in 1, O in 2, T in 3, Y in 5, but H must be in 5.

""WOOTH"" – W in 1, O in 2, T in 4, H in 5 – this seems valid.

Between MOOTH and WOOTH, both fit:
- MOOTH: M O O T H
- WOOTH: W O O T H

Both are valid, but MOOTH is more common as a word (though rare).

But let's check if there's a word with T in 4 and no double O:

_ O _ T H:
- Could be F O _ T H: FOLTH (not a word), FOWTH (not a word).
- Could be D O _ T H: DOLTH (not a word), DOMTH (not a word).
- Could be L O _ T H: LOLTH (not a word), LOMTH (not a word).
- Could be V O _ T H: VOLT? No, 5 letters.

Seems no common words here.

Thus, the best candidates are MOOTH or WOOTH, both fitting:
- O in 2 (✓)
- H in 5 (✓)
- T in 4 (allowed)
- No banned letters.

Between these, MOOTH is more likely the intended word.

But let's verify:
- MOOTH: M O O T H
  - M: allowed
  - O: allowed in 2
  - O: allowed in 3 (no restriction)
  - T: allowed in 4
  - H: allowed in 5
  - No banned letters.

Thus, MOOTH is a valid next guess.From the latest feedback:
- Position 2 is O (✓)
- Position 5 is H (✓)
- T must appear (but not in positions 1, 3, or 5), so T is in position 4
- Forbidden letters now include U, G, plus all previously banned letters

Pattern: _ O _ T H

The only common word fitting this is MOOTH (M-O-O-T-H).

From the latest feedback (MOOTH → M(x) O(✓) O(-) T(✓) H(✓)) we now know:

1. Position 2 = O (✓) — still required.
2. Position 5 = H (✓) — still required.
3. Position 4 = T (✓) — newly fixed; T is now locked in slot 4.
4. The second O (in position 3) is in the word but in the wrong place (it cannot be in slot 3).  
   Therefore the word contains exactly one O (since the other O would have shown up as a ✓ if it were in the correct spot), and that O must be in slot 2 (which we already have) — so there is no second O anywhere else.  
   Thus, the third slot must be a letter other than O.

5. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C, U, G, M.

6. Current pattern: _ O _ T H  
   The blank in slot 3 must be one of the still-allowed letters: D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

7. Valid English 5-letter words fitting _ O _ T H with no banned letters:
   - FOOTH (not standard)
   - JOTTH (not a word)
   - KOTTH (not a word)
   - LOTTH (not a word)
   - VOTTH (not a word)
   - WOTTH (not a word)
   - YOTTH (not a word)
   - ZOTTH (not a word)

   The only legitimate dictionary entry that matches is “FOOTH,” but it is archaic.  
   Rechecking, the standard modern word is “FOOTY,” but that ends in Y, not H.  
   There is no other common English word left that fits the pattern _ O _ T H with the remaining allowed letters.

However, we overlooked one: “LOTHY” (an archaic term for “lothe”), but H must be in slot 5.  
Another candidate: “VOOTH” (a dialectal form), but again H must be in slot 5.

Re-evaluating, the only valid modern word that fits the constraints is:

FOOTH (obsolete but listed in some dictionaries) or the extremely rare “JOOTY” (which would require H in slot 5 but has Y instead).

But the pattern is strictly _ O _ T H, and the only letter left that makes a legitimate (if uncommon) word is:

D O _ T H → “DOOTH” (a Scots word for “dooth” or “doot” extended, but not standard).

After careful reconsideration, the only remaining plausible word is:

FOOTH (F-O-O-T-H), despite its archaic status, because it is the only one that satisfies every constraint.

But we have already ruled out O in slot 3, so the word must be _ O [non-O] T H.  
Given that, and the remaining letters, the only valid word is:

JOTTH (not valid), KOTTH (invalid), etc. — none exist.

Realization: the only remaining valid modern English word fitting _ O _ T H with no banned letters is:

“FOOTY” is invalid (ends Y).  
“FOOTH” is the only one left, albeit obsolete.

However, upon double-checking, the word “LOOTY” has H in slot 5 and T in slot 4, but O repeats.  
But we have no evidence against double-O; the feedback only told us the second O is misplaced, not that there is only one O.  
Thus, the word could be L-O-O-T-H, i.e., LOOTH (a variant spelling of “loot” extended), but it is not standard.

After exhaustive search, the only remaining valid word is:

“FOOTY” is invalid (Y).  
“FOOTH” is the only one left.

But let’s re-examine the O feedback:  
MOOTH feedback: O(-) in slot 3 means the letter O is in the word but not in slot 3.  
We already have O in slot 2, so the word contains at least two O’s: one in slot 2 and another somewhere else.  
Thus slot 3 can be any letter except O (because the other O cannot be in slot 3), but the word can have another O elsewhere.  
Therefore, the pattern is actually:  
- Slot 2 = O (✓)  
- Slot 4 = T (✓)  
- Slot 5 = H (✓)  
- Slot 1 and 3 can be any allowed letters, and slot 3 can be O (but then there would be two O’s).  

Thus, the word can be:  
[allowed letter] O [allowed letter (could be O)] T H  

Valid modern words fitting this:

- FOOTH (F-O-O-T-H) – archaic but valid  
- JOOTY – invalid (Y)  
- KOOTY – invalid (Y)  
- LOOTY – invalid (Y)  
- VOOTY – invalid (Y)  

The only remaining valid word is FOOTH.

Hence, the correct next guess is FOOTH.

<guess>FOOTH</guess>",FOOTH,"From the latest feedback (MOOTH → M(x) O(✓) O(-) T(✓) H(✓)) we now know:

1. Position 2 = O (✓) — still required.
2. Position 5 = H (✓) — still required.
3. Position 4 = T (✓) — newly fixed; T is now locked in slot 4.
4. The second O (in position 3) is in the word but in the wrong place (it cannot be in slot 3).  
   Therefore the word contains exactly one O (since the other O would have shown up as a ✓ if it were in the correct spot), and that O must be in slot 2 (which we already have) — so there is no second O anywhere else.  
   Thus, the third slot must be a letter other than O.

5. Forbidden letters so far:  
   A, R, S, E, P, I, N, B, C, U, G, M.

6. Current pattern: _ O _ T H  
   The blank in slot 3 must be one of the still-allowed letters: D, F, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

7. Valid English 5-letter words fitting _ O _ T H with no banned letters:
   - FOOTH (not standard)
