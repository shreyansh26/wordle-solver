For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
- Does not contain L, T, or E.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and A but moves them to new positions.
2. Avoids L, T, E.
3. Introduces new common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good untested common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, G, etc.

A balanced choice is “RAINS”:
- R – new consonant.
- A – known to be in the word; now in position 2.
- I – new vowel.
- N – new consonant.
- S – known to be in the word; now in position 5.

This tests 3 new letters (R, I, N) while repositioning S and A.

A good candidate is “CABOS”:
- C – new consonant
- A – known to be in the word (position 2 is still open)
- B – new consonant
- O – new vowel

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used letters in English.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- S(-)  – S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
- Does not contain L, T, or E.

We now want a new guess that:
1. Keeps S and A but moves them to new positions.
2. Avoids L, T, E.
3. Introduces new common letters we haven’t tested yet.

Good untested common letters: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, G, etc.

A balanced choice is “RAINS”:
- R – new consonant.
- A – known to be in the word; now in position 2.
- I – new vowel.
- N – new consonant.
- S – known to be in the word; now in position 5.

This tests 3 new letters (R, I, N) while repositioning S and A.

Current knowledge:

Letters in the word and their status:
- S – fixed in position 5 (✓)
- A – in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from RAINS and CABOS)
- O – in the word but NOT in position 4 (from CABOS)

Letters known to be absent: L, T, E, R, I, N, C, B

So the pattern is:
_ _ _ _ S
with A in position 1 or 4, and O somewhere except position 4.

Possible positions for A: 1 or 4
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

Let’s list remaining common letters that haven’t been used and are still allowed:
D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y

We need a word that:
- Ends in S
- Contains A (in 1 or 4)
- Contains O (in 1, 2, or 3)
- Uses only the allowed letters

A good candidate is “GAMOS”:
- G – new consonant
- A – in position 2 (but we know A is not in position 2 from RAINS) – so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “HOMAS”:
- H – new consonant
- O – in position 2
- M – new consonant
- A – in position 4 (allowed)
- S – fixed in position 5

This fits all constraints:
- Ends in S
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- O in position 2
- Uses only allowed letters (H, O, M, A, S)

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their constraints:
- S – locked in position 5 (✓)
- A – in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from RAINS, CABOS, HOMAS)
- O – in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from CABOS, HOMAS)

Therefore:
- A must be in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- O must be in position 3 (only remaining spot)

Word skeleton so far:
A _ O _ S

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, R, I, N, C, B, H, M

Remaining unused common letters: D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Ends with S
- Uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 2 and 4

Candidate pairs for positions 2 and 4 from the allowed set:
- Position 2: D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Y
- Position 4: D, F, G, K, P, U, W, Y

We need to form real words. Scanning possibilities:

- A D O G S → ""ADOGS"" – valid word (though rare)
- A F O G S – no such word
- A G O D S – ""AGODS"" – not a valid word
- A P O D S – ""APods"" – not valid
- A U O D S – not valid
- A W O G S – not valid
- A Y O D S – not valid

The only real word fitting the pattern is ""ADOGS"".

Let's verify:
- A in position 1 – allowed
- O in position 3 – allowed
- S in position 5 – locked
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (D, G)

Thus, ""ADOGS"" is the logical next guess.

From the latest feedback on ADOGS:

- A(✓)  – A is in position 1 and correct.

- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in position 5 and correct.

So the pattern is now:
A _ _ _ S
with O somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 3 or 5).

Letters still ruled out: L, T, E, R, I, N, C, B, H, M, D, G.

Remaining common letters: F, K, P, U, W, Y.

We need a real 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A, ends with S.
- Contains O in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters in the remaining spots.

Possible skeletons:
- A O _ _ S  (O in position 2)
- A _ _ O S  (O in position 4)

A O _ _ S

- A O K F S – not a word
- A O P U S – not a word
- A O U P S – not a word

- A K Y O S – “AKYOS” – not a word
- A P Y O S – “APYOS” – not a word
- A W Y O S – “AWYOS” – not a word

The only real word that fits is “AFOGS” – but G is already ruled out.

Next real word: “AKOS” – too short.

Next: “APPOS” – but P is allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Let’s check “APPOS”:
- A P P O S – but O is in position 4, which is allowed.
- Letters: A, P, O, S – all allowed so far.

Thus, “APPOS” is the correct word.
