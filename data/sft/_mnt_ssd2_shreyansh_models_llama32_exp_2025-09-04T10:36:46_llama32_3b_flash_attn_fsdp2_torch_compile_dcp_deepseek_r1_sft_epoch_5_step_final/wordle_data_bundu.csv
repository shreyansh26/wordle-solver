 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

<guess>night</guess>",night,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).",Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that\'s 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, T, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? \n   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? \n   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, O, W, Y.\n\n Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using two N\'s might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try a word with one N for now.\n\n I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven\'t tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can\'t because N is in the 4th.\n\n How about ""NIGHT"": \n   N(1), I, G, H, T.\n\n This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   I: new letter\n   G: new letter\n   H: new letter\n   T: new letter\n\n This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that\'s acceptable? \n   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s a new position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. Both are common.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.\n\n Let me go with ""NIGHT"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.\n\n ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? \n   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that\'s a new position for N.\n\n But we don\'t know about B, I, S, O.\n\n I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? \n\n However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.\n\n I\'ll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:\n- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""night""
  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
  I: x (not in word)
  G: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

And the letter 'N' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes 'N' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don't know which one, but we can use other N's? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple N's, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can't be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list the available letters: 
Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T
Known present: N (but position unknown)

So available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)

We need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

We know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven't tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:
- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.

However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.

But wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven't tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.

But note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.

Another word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.

So ""UNLIT"" is invalid.

How about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.

""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
S: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.

But we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y.

Alternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _
For example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.
""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.
""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": 
B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that's a possibility.

But we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.
""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include N.

So for N in the 3rd: 
""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? 
P(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.

We must avoid putting N in the 4th.

So for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.
""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable? 
But we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, U, K, Y.

Alternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N
Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.
""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.
""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.
""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.

So we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.
- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.
- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.

But wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.

However, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.

We also note that we have not tested the letter O. It's a common vowel.

So let's consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven't tested and also tests more common letters.

Another word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.
""SNOWY"" is okay.

With N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N's? And U and Y. But note: we don't know if the word has two N's. But it's possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N's, we might get two marks for N? But we don't know if there are two. Also, we are using two N's when we might test two new letters.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

But we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. It's risky.

Alternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.

But let's see the letters: 
- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.
- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.
- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).

We also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.

We want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven't tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.

So the remaining vowels are O and U.

""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.
""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).
""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).

I think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.

So I'll go with ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it's in the 3rd we get a '-' and we know it's not in 2nd, etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven't tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.

Another candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N's? And it's 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.

So let's stick with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".

If we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.

So, I choose ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven't tested B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.

We want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.

So ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.

Also, note that we haven't tested O, which is a common vowel.

So let's go with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a '-' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.

Therefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I'll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").
- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.

The word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>snowy</guess>",snowy,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""night""
  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
  I: x (not in word)
  G: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.

But wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven't tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.

But note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.

Another word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.

So ""UNLIT"" is invalid.

How about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.

""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
S: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.

But we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y.

Alternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _
For example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.
""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.
""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": 
B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that's a possibility.

We must avoid putting N in the 4th.

So for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.
""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable? 
But we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, U, K, Y.

Alternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N
Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.
""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.
""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.
""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.

So we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.
- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.
- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.

But wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.

However, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.

We also note that we have not tested the letter O. It's a common vowel.

So let's consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven't tested and also tests more common letters.

Another word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.
""SNOWY"" is okay.

With N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N's? And U and Y. But note: we don't know if the word has two N's. But it's possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N's, we might get two marks for N? But we don't know if there are two.

Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. It's risky.

Alternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.

But let's see the letters: 
- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.
- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.
- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).

We also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.

We want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven't tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.

So the remaining vowels are O and U.

""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.
""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).
""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).

I think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.

So I'll go with ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it's in the 3rd we get a '-' and we know it's not in 2nd, etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven't tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.

Another candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N's? And it's 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.

So let's stick with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".

If we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.

So, I choose ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven't tested B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.

We want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.

So ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.

Also, note that we haven't tested O, which is a common vowel.

So let's go with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a '-' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.

Therefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".

<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I'll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").
- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.

The word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.",Guess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

<guess>night</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""night""
  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
  I: x (not in word)
  G: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

And the letter 'N' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes 'N' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don't know which one, but we can use other N's? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple N's, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can't be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list the available letters: 
Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T
Known present: N (but position unknown)

So available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)

We need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

We know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven't tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:
- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.

However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.

But wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven't tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.

But note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.

Another word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.

So ""UNLIT"" is invalid.

How about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.

""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
S: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.

But we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y.

Alternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _
For example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.
""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.
""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": 
B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that's a possibility.

But we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.
""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include N.

So for N in the 3rd: 
""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? 
P(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.

We must avoid putting N in the 4th.

So for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.
""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable? 
But we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, U, K, Y.

Alternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N
Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.
""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.
""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.
""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.

So we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.
- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.
- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.

But wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.

However, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.

We also note that we have not tested the letter O. It's a common vowel.

So let's consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven't tested and also tests more common letters.

Another word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.
""SNOWY"" is okay.

With N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N's? And U and Y. But note: we don't know if the word has two N's. But it's possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N's, we might get two marks for N? But we don't know if there are two. Also, we are using two N's when we might test two new letters.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

But we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. It's risky.

Alternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.

But let's see the letters: 
- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.
- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.
- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).

We also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.

We want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven't tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.

So the remaining vowels are O and U.

""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.
""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).
""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).

I think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.

So I'll go with ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it's in the 3rd we get a '-' and we know it's not in 2nd, etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven't tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.

Another candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N's? And it's 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.

So let's stick with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".

If we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.

So, I choose ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven't tested B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.

We want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.

So ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.

Also, note that we haven't tested O, which is a common vowel.

So let's go with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a '-' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.

Therefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".

<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I'll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").
- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.

The word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don\'t have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes \'N\' and uses other common letters.\n\n Idea: Start with a word that has \'N\' in the first position? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has \'N\' in a different position than 4.\n\n Example words:\n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, \'N\' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, \'N\' was in the 4th position and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put \'N\' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting \'N\' in the 4th.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has \'N\' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word with \'N\' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don\'t know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with \'N\' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.\n\n So, we must avoid E and A.\n\n Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.\n\n Possibilities:\n - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.\n - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven\'t tested.\n - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven\'t tested T, H, I, K.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an \'N\', so we can try to use it.\n\n However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.\n\n Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it\'s in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn\'t make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.\n\n So, let\'s try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: \n   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.\n\n But we don\'t know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""NOISY"": \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.\n\n Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\n Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.\n\n However, we don\'t know if U, L, I, T are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.\n\n Some options:\n - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": \n        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that\'s 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, T, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? \n   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? \n   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, O, W, Y.\n\n Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using two N\'s might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try a word with one N for now.\n\n I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven\'t tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can\'t because N is in the 4th.\n\n How about ""NIGHT"": \n   N(1), I, G, H, T.\n\n This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   I: new letter\n   G: new letter\n   H: new letter\n   T: new letter\n\n This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that\'s acceptable? \n   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s a new position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. Both are common.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.\n\n Let me go with ""NIGHT"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.\n\n ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? \n   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that\'s a new position for N.\n\n But we don\'t know about B, I, S, O.\n\n I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? \n\n However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.\n\n I\'ll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:\n- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""night""\n  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position?

So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n  I: x (not in word)\n  G: x (not in word)\n  H: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAnd the letter \'N\' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes \'N\' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).\n- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don\'t know which one, but we can use other N\'s? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple N\'s, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can\'t be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: \nForbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T\nKnown present: N (but position unknown)\n\nSo available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)\n\nWe need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven\'t tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:\n- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nBut wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven\'t tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.\n\nBut note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.\n\nSo ""UNLIT"" is invalid.\n\nHow about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.\n\n""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? \nS: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _\nFor example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.\n""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.\n""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": \nB(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that\'s a possibility.\n\nBut we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include N.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: \n""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? \nP(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in the 4th.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nExample: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.\n""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \nF(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable? \nBut we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, U, K, Y.\n\nAlternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N\nExample: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.\n""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.\n""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.\n""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.\n\nSo we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.\n- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.\n- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.\n\nBut wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.\n\nWe also note that we have not tested the letter O. It\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven\'t tested and also tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""SNOWY"" is okay.\n\nWith N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N\'s? And U and Y. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N\'s and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N\'s, we might get two marks for N? But we don\'t know if there are two. Also, we are using two N\'s when we might test two new letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N\'s in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. It\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: \n- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.\n- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.\n- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).\n\nWe also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.\n\nWe want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven\'t tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.\n\nSo the remaining vowels are O and U.\n\n""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.\n""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).\n""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).\n\nI think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it\'s in the 3rd we get a \'-\' and we know it\'s not in 2nd, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven\'t tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N\'s? And it\'s 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".\n\nIf we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nSo, I choose ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven\'t tested B, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.\n\nWe want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.\n\nSo ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.\n\nAlso, note that we haven\'t tested O, which is a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).\n2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).\n3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I\'ll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").\n- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.\n- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.\n\nThe word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:\n- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""snowy"":
 S: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 2nd position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position? Actually, we know from guess1 that N is not in 4th, from guess2 that not in 1st, and now from guess3 that not in 2nd. Therefore, the only possibility is that N is in the 3rd position? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and we have ruled out 1,2,4 and now 2? Actually, we have ruled out 1 (from guess2), 2 (from guess3), and 4 (from guess1). So the 3rd position is the only one left? But wait, we also have 5th? We haven't tested the 5th.

 However, we know that N must be in the word and is not in any of the positions we've tried and gotten wrong. So the 3rd position is a candidate. But we haven't tested the 5th? We can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have N in the 5th. We haven't tested the 5th position for N.

 Actually, we have tested:
 - 1st: guess2 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 1st
 - 2nd: guess3 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 2nd
 - 4th: guess1 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 4th

 And we haven't tested 3rd and 5th.

 But in guess3, we put N in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd. So we know N is not in 2nd. Similarly, we know it's not in 1st, 4th. So the only position left is 3rd? But wait, what about 5th? We haven't tested 5th.

 Actually, we can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter N.
 - N is not in position 1, 2, 4 (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, guess3 respectively) -> so the only possibility is position 3 or 5.

 We have two candidates: 3rd and 5th.

 We can try to test both? But we can only test one at a time.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use 5 letters.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B, L, O, W, N -> but we put N in the 5th? 
   In ""BLOWN"": B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> so we are testing the 5th position for N.

 But we also want to test the 3rd? We can do that in a later guess.

 However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
 Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So B, L, O, W, N are allowed.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And if we get an 'x'? But we know N is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 But we are also testing B, L, O, W in the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th positions.

 So, let's consider ""BLOWN"". 

 However, we have to be cautious: what if the word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one N.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 How about ""FUNNY""? 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> but we are putting N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid because it has N in the 4th? Actually, ""FUNNY"" has N in the 3rd and 4th? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). 
   But we know that N is not in the 4th (from guess1), so we cannot use the 4th position for N. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY""? Same issue: B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N.

 So we avoid.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> N is in the 5th and only the 3rd is left? But we are testing the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use one N.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> but N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": 
   B, O, U, N, D -> N in the 4th? Same issue.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd? Or in the 5th.

 Let me think of words with N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   Example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. 
   ""PLANK"" -> A forbidden.
   ""CLANK"" -> C forbidden.

 How about ""STUNK"": 
   S, T, U, N, K -> but S and T are forbidden? T is forbidden (from guess2) and S is forbidden (from guess3). So no.

 How about ""JUMPS"": no N.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N? So we cannot use the 4th.

 How about ""DUNNY"": 
   D, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, 4th is invalid.

 We must avoid the 4th for N.

 So, how about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""MINTY"": 
   M, I, N, T, Y -> but I and T are forbidden. No.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H are forbidden. No.

 How about ""LUNGY"": 
   L, U, N, G, Y -> G is forbidden (from guess2). No.

 How about ""XENON"": 
   X, E, N, O, N -> E is forbidden. No.

 How about ""BLOWN"" we already have: B, L, O, W, N -> N in the 5th. And the letters B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
   B: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, W: allowed, N: known present.

 So ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And we get information about B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are having trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BLOND"" is invalid. What about ""BLAND""? A forbidden.

 How about ""PLUMB"": 
   P, L, U, M, B -> no N? We must include N.

 How about ""UNCLIP"": too long.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   How about ""BORNS""? Not a word. 
   ""BORNE"" -> E forbidden.
   ""HORNS"": H and R forbidden? H is forbidden (from guess2) and R is forbidden (from guess1). 

 How about ""WOMAN"": 
   W, O, M, A, N -> A forbidden.

 How about ""YOGIN"": 
   Y, O, G, I, N -> G and I forbidden.

 How about ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> E forbidden.

 How about ""KOINE"": 
   K, O, I, N, E -> I and E forbidden.

 I'm struggling. Maybe we should focus on the 5th position for now.

 Another word: ""BLOWN"" is one option. But we can also try ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of.

 Alternatively, ""BOWLN""? Not a word.

 Or ""BOWNS""? Not a word.

 How about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> but N is in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid. So we cannot use.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": same.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 How about ""WOUND"": 
   W, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   W(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""HOUND"": same.

 How about ""MOUND"": same.

 How about ""BLAND"": 
   B, L, A, N, D -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""CLINK"": 
   C, L, I, N, K -> C and I forbidden.

 How about ""FLING"": 
   F, L, I, N, G -> I and G forbidden.

 How about ""SLING"": 
   S, L, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""STING"": 
   S, T, I, N, G -> S, T, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""SWING"": 
   S, W, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""BLUNT"": 
   B, L, U, N, T -> T forbidden.

 How about ""FLUNG"": 
   F, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""CLUNG"": 
   C, L, U, N, G -> C and G forbidden.

 How about ""PLUNG"": 
   P, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of that has N in the 5th and no forbidden letters? 
   B, L, O, W, N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4, N5.

 This uses B, L, O, W, N. All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd.

 Also, we test B, L, O, W.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

 However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a '-' for N and then we know it's in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.

 How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.

 How about ""UNCLO"": 
   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.

 How about ""UNDID"": 
   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.

 How about ""UNFIT"": 
   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.

 How about ""UNPIN"": 
   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N's? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven't tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got '-', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven't tested 3rd.

 However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.

 Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""LUNCH"": same.

 How about ""PUNCH"": same.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 How about ""HUNCH"": same.

 How about ""WENCH"": same.

 How about ""DUNCE"": 
   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.

 How about ""DUNGE"": 
   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). 
   But we haven't tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it's valid.

 But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that's the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.

 So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.

 Now, we have two options: 
   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)
   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)

 Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.

 We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.

 We can choose either. Let's choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.

 But we have to decide.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.

 ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? 

 But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.

 I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.

 Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.

 So let's go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

<guess>blown</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1, 2, or 4**. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, Y (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, L, U, M, P, F, K, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in position 5**: Since position 3 is the only other candidate for N, I'll test it in position 5 (using ""BLOWN"").
- **Test new common letters**: Use B, L, O, W (which are common and untested) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters are used.

The word **""BLOWN""** fits:
- Places N in position 5 (testing the only remaining possibility).
- Uses new common letters: B, L, O, W.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>blown</guess>",blown,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""snowy"":
 S: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 2nd position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position? Actually, we know from guess1 that N is not in 4th, from guess2 that not in 1st, and now from guess3 that not in 2nd. Therefore, the only possibility is that N is in the 3rd position? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and we have ruled out 1,2,4 and now 2? Actually, we have ruled out 1 (from guess2), 2 (from guess3), and 4 (from guess1). So the 3rd position is the only one left? But wait, we also have 5th? We haven't tested the 5th.

 However, we know that N must be in the word and is not in any of the positions we've tried and gotten wrong. So the 3rd position is a candidate. But we haven't tested the 5th? We can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have N in the 5th. We haven't tested the 5th position for N.

 Actually, we have tested:
 - 1st: guess2 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 1st
 - 2nd: guess3 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 2nd
 - 4th: guess1 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 4th

 And we haven't tested 3rd and 5th.

 But in guess3, we put N in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd. So we know N is not in 2nd. Similarly, we know it's not in 1st, 4th. So the only position left is 3rd? But wait, what about 5th? We haven't tested 5th.

 Actually, we can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter N.
 - N is not in position 1, 2, 4 (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, guess3 respectively) -> so the only possibility is position 3 or 5.

 We have two candidates: 3rd and 5th.

 We can try to test both? But we can only test one at a time.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use 5 letters.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B, L, O, W, N -> but we put N in the 5th? 
   In ""BLOWN"": B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> so we are testing the 5th position for N.

 But we also want to test the 3rd? We can do that in a later guess.

 However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
 Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So B, L, O, W, N are allowed.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And if we get an 'x'? But we know N is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 But we are also testing B, L, O, W in the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th positions.

 So, let's consider ""BLOWN"". 

 However, we have to be cautious: what if the word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one N.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 How about ""FUNNY""? 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> but we are putting N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid because it has N in the 4th? Actually, ""FUNNY"" has N in the 3rd and 4th? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). 
   But we know that N is not in the 4th (from guess1), so we cannot use the 4th position for N. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY""? Same issue: B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N.

 So we avoid.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> N is in the 5th and only the 3rd is left? But we are testing the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use one N.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> but N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": 
   B, O, U, N, D -> N in the 4th? Same issue.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd? Or in the 5th.

 Let me think of words with N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   Example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. 
   ""PLANK"" -> A forbidden.
   ""CLANK"" -> C forbidden.

 How about ""STUNK"": 
   S, T, U, N, K -> but S and T are forbidden? T is forbidden (from guess2) and S is forbidden (from guess3). So no.

 How about ""JUMPS"": no N.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N? So we cannot use the 4th.

 How about ""DUNNY"": 
   D, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, 4th is invalid.

 We must avoid the 4th for N.

 So, how about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""MINTY"": 
   M, I, N, T, Y -> but I and T are forbidden. No.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H are forbidden. No.

 How about ""LUNGY"": 
   L, U, N, G, Y -> G is forbidden (from guess2). No.

 How about ""XENON"": 
   X, E, N, O, N -> E is forbidden. No.

 How about ""BLOWN"" we already have: B, L, O, W, N -> N in the 5th. And the letters B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
   B: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, W: allowed, N: known present.

 So ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And we get information about B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are having trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BLOND"" is invalid. What about ""BLAND""? A forbidden.

 How about ""PLUMB"": 
   P, L, U, M, B -> no N? We must include N.

 How about ""UNCLIP"": too long.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   How about ""BORNS""? Not a word. 
   ""BORNE"" -> E forbidden.
   ""HORNS"": H and R forbidden? H is forbidden (from guess2) and R is forbidden (from guess1). 

 How about ""WOMAN"": 
   W, O, M, A, N -> A forbidden.

 How about ""YOGIN"": 
   Y, O, G, I, N -> G and I forbidden.

 How about ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> E forbidden.

 How about ""KOINE"": 
   K, O, I, N, E -> I and E forbidden.

 I'm struggling. Maybe we should focus on the 5th position for now.

 Another word: ""BLOWN"" is one option. But we can also try ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of.

 Alternatively, ""BOWLN""? Not a word.

 Or ""BOWNS""? Not a word.

 How about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> but N is in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid. So we cannot use.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": same.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 How about ""WOUND"": 
   W, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   W(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""HOUND"": same.

 How about ""MOUND"": same.

 How about ""BLAND"": 
   B, L, A, N, D -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""CLINK"": 
   C, L, I, N, K -> C and I forbidden.

 How about ""FLING"": 
   F, L, I, N, G -> I and G forbidden.

 How about ""SLING"": 
   S, L, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""STING"": 
   S, T, I, N, G -> S, T, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""SWING"": 
   S, W, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""BLUNT"": 
   B, L, U, N, T -> T forbidden.

 How about ""FLUNG"": 
   F, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""CLUNG"": 
   C, L, U, N, G -> C and G forbidden.

 How about ""PLUNG"": 
   P, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of that has N in the 5th and no forbidden letters? 
   B, L, O, W, N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4, N5.

 This uses B, L, O, W, N. All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd.

 Also, we test B, L, O, W.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

 However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a '-' for N and then we know it's in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.

 How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.

 How about ""UNCLO"": 
   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.

 How about ""UNDID"": 
   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.

 How about ""UNFIT"": 
   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.

 How about ""UNPIN"": 
   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N's? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven't tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got '-', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven't tested 3rd.

 However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.

 Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""LUNCH"": same.

 How about ""PUNCH"": same.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 How about ""HUNCH"": same.

 How about ""WENCH"": same.

 How about ""DUNCE"": 
   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.

 How about ""DUNGE"": 
   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). 
   But we haven't tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it's valid.

 But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that's the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.

 So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.

 Now, we have two options: 
   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)
   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)

 Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.

 We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.

 We can choose either. Let's choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.

 But we have to decide.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.

 ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? 

 But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.

 I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.

 Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.

 So let's go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

<guess>blown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1, 2, or 4**. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, Y (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, L, U, M, P, F, K, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in position 5**: Since position 3 is the only other candidate for N, I'll test it in position 5 (using ""BLOWN"").
- **Test new common letters**: Use B, L, O, W (which are common and untested) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters are used.

The word **""BLOWN""** fits:
- Places N in position 5 (testing the only remaining possibility).
- Uses new common letters: B, L, O, W.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.",Guess 4: blown -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x) N(-),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

<guess>night</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""night""
  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
  I: x (not in word)
  G: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

And the letter 'N' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes 'N' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don't know which one, but we can use other N's? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple N's, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can't be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list the available letters: 
Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T
Known present: N (but position unknown)

So available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)

We need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

We know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven't tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:
- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.

However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.

But wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven't tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.

But note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.

Another word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.

So ""UNLIT"" is invalid.

How about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.

""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
S: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.

But we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y.

Alternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _
For example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.
""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.
""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": 
B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that's a possibility.

But we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.
""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include N.

So for N in the 3rd: 
""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? 
P(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.

We must avoid putting N in the 4th.

So for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.
""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable? 
But we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, U, K, Y.

Alternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N
Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.
""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.
""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.
""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.

So we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.
- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.
- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.

But wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.

However, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.

We also note that we have not tested the letter O. It's a common vowel.

So let's consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven't tested and also tests more common letters.

Another word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.
""SNOWY"" is okay.

With N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N's? And U and Y. But note: we don't know if the word has two N's. But it's possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N's, we might get two marks for N? But we don't know if there are two. Also, we are using two N's when we might test two new letters.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

But we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. It's risky.

Alternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.

But let's see the letters: 
- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.
- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.
- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).

We also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.

We want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven't tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.

So the remaining vowels are O and U.

""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.
""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).
""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).

I think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.

So I'll go with ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it's in the 3rd we get a '-' and we know it's not in 2nd, etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven't tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.

Another candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N's? And it's 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.

So let's stick with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".

If we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.

So, I choose ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven't tested B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.

We want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.

So ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.

Also, note that we haven't tested O, which is a common vowel.

So let's go with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a '-' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.

Therefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".

<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I'll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").
- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.

The word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>snowy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the third guess ""snowy"":
 S: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 2nd position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position? Actually, we know from guess1 that N is not in 4th, from guess2 that not in 1st, and now from guess3 that not in 2nd. Therefore, the only possibility is that N is in the 3rd position? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and we have ruled out 1,2,4 and now 2? Actually, we have ruled out 1 (from guess2), 2 (from guess3), and 4 (from guess1). So the 3rd position is the only one left? But wait, we also have 5th? We haven't tested the 5th.

 However, we know that N must be in the word and is not in any of the positions we've tried and gotten wrong. So the 3rd position is a candidate. But we haven't tested the 5th? We can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have N in the 5th. We haven't tested the 5th position for N.

 Actually, we have tested:
 - 1st: guess2 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 1st
 - 2nd: guess3 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 2nd
 - 4th: guess1 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 4th

 And we haven't tested 3rd and 5th.

 But in guess3, we put N in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd. So we know N is not in 2nd. Similarly, we know it's not in 1st, 4th. So the only position left is 3rd? But wait, what about 5th? We haven't tested 5th.

 Actually, we can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter N.
 - N is not in position 1, 2, 4 (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, guess3 respectively) -> so the only possibility is position 3 or 5.

 We have two candidates: 3rd and 5th.

 We can try to test both? But we can only test one at a time.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use 5 letters.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B, L, O, W, N -> but we put N in the 5th? 
   In ""BLOWN"": B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> so we are testing the 5th position for N.

 But we also want to test the 3rd? We can do that in a later guess.

 However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
 Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So B, L, O, W, N are allowed.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And if we get an 'x'? But we know N is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 But we are also testing B, L, O, W in the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th positions.

 So, let's consider ""BLOWN"". 

 However, we have to be cautious: what if the word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one N.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 How about ""FUNNY""? 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> but we are putting N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid because it has N in the 4th? Actually, ""FUNNY"" has N in the 3rd and 4th? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). 
   But we know that N is not in the 4th (from guess1), so we cannot use the 4th position for N. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY""? Same issue: B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N.

 So we avoid.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> N is in the 5th and only the 3rd is left? But we are testing the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use one N.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> but N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": 
   B, O, U, N, D -> N in the 4th? Same issue.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd? Or in the 5th.

 Let me think of words with N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   Example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. 
   ""PLANK"" -> A forbidden.
   ""CLANK"" -> C forbidden.

 How about ""STUNK"": 
   S, T, U, N, K -> but S and T are forbidden? T is forbidden (from guess2) and S is forbidden (from guess3). So no.

 How about ""JUMPS"": no N.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N? So we cannot use the 4th.

 How about ""DUNNY"": 
   D, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, 4th is invalid.

 We must avoid the 4th for N.

 So, how about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""MINTY"": 
   M, I, N, T, Y -> but I and T are forbidden. No.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H are forbidden. No.

 How about ""LUNGY"": 
   L, U, N, G, Y -> G is forbidden (from guess2). No.

 How about ""XENON"": 
   X, E, N, O, N -> E is forbidden. No.

 How about ""BLOWN"" we already have: B, L, O, W, N -> N in the 5th. And the letters B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
   B: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, W: allowed, N: known present.

 So ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And we get information about B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are having trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BLOND"" is invalid. What about ""BLAND""? A forbidden.

 How about ""PLUMB"": 
   P, L, U, M, B -> no N? We must include N.

 How about ""UNCLIP"": too long.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   How about ""BORNS""? Not a word. 
   ""BORNE"" -> E forbidden.
   ""HORNS"": H and R forbidden? H is forbidden (from guess2) and R is forbidden (from guess1). 

 How about ""WOMAN"": 
   W, O, M, A, N -> A forbidden.

 How about ""YOGIN"": 
   Y, O, G, I, N -> G and I forbidden.

 How about ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> E forbidden.

 How about ""KOINE"": 
   K, O, I, N, E -> I and E forbidden.

 I'm struggling. Maybe we should focus on the 5th position for now.

 Another word: ""BLOWN"" is one option. But we can also try ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of.

 Alternatively, ""BOWLN""? Not a word.

 Or ""BOWNS""? Not a word.

 How about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> but N is in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid. So we cannot use.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": same.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 How about ""WOUND"": 
   W, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   W(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""HOUND"": same.

 How about ""MOUND"": same.

 How about ""BLAND"": 
   B, L, A, N, D -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""CLINK"": 
   C, L, I, N, K -> C and I forbidden.

 How about ""FLING"": 
   F, L, I, N, G -> I and G forbidden.

 How about ""SLING"": 
   S, L, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""STING"": 
   S, T, I, N, G -> S, T, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""SWING"": 
   S, W, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""BLUNT"": 
   B, L, U, N, T -> T forbidden.

 How about ""FLUNG"": 
   F, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""CLUNG"": 
   C, L, U, N, G -> C and G forbidden.

 How about ""PLUNG"": 
   P, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of that has N in the 5th and no forbidden letters? 
   B, L, O, W, N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4, N5.

 This uses B, L, O, W, N. All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd.

 Also, we test B, L, O, W.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

 However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a '-' for N and then we know it's in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.

 How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.

 How about ""UNCLO"": 
   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.

 How about ""UNDID"": 
   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.

 How about ""UNFIT"": 
   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.

 How about ""UNPIN"": 
   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N's? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven't tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got '-', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven't tested 3rd.

 However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.

 Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""LUNCH"": same.

 How about ""PUNCH"": same.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 How about ""HUNCH"": same.

 How about ""WENCH"": same.

 How about ""DUNCE"": 
   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.

 How about ""DUNGE"": 
   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). 
   But we haven't tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it's valid.

 But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that's the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.

 So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.

 Now, we have two options: 
   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)
   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)

 Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.

 We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.

 We can choose either. Let's choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.

 But we have to decide.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.

 ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? 

 But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.

 I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.

 Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.

 So let's go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

<guess>blown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1, 2, or 4**. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, Y (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, L, U, M, P, F, K, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in position 5**: Since position 3 is the only other candidate for N, I'll test it in position 5 (using ""BLOWN"").
- **Test new common letters**: Use B, L, O, W (which are common and untested) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters are used.

The word **""BLOWN""** fits:
- Places N in position 5 (testing the only remaining possibility).
- Uses new common letters: B, L, O, W.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

Includes \'N\' (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.\n 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.\n\n Since \'N\' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing \'N\' in a different position.\n\n Possible positions for \'N\': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.\n\n We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don\'t have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes \'N\' and uses other common letters.\n\n Idea: Start with a word that has \'N\' in the first position? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has \'N\' in a different position than 4.\n\n Example words:\n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, \'N\' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, \'N\' was in the 4th position and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put \'N\' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting \'N\' in the 4th.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has \'N\' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word with \'N\' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don\'t know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with \'N\' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.\n\n So, we must avoid E and A.\n\n Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.\n\n Possibilities:\n - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.\n - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven\'t tested.\n - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven\'t tested T, H, I, K.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an \'N\', so we can try to use it.\n\n However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.\n\n Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it\'s in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn\'t make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.\n\n So, let\'s try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: \n   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.\n\n But we don\'t know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""NOISY"": \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.\n\n Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\n Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.\n\n However, we don\'t know if U, L, I, T are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.\n\n Some options:\n - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": \n        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that\'s 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, T, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? \n   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? \n   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, O, W, Y.\n\n Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using two N\'s might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try a word with one N for now.\n\n I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven\'t tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can\'t because N is in the 4th.\n\n How about ""NIGHT"": \n   N(1), I, G, H, T.\n\n This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   I: new letter\n   G: new letter\n   H: new letter\n   T: new letter\n\n This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that\'s acceptable? \n   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s a new position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. Both are common.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.\n\n Let me go with ""NIGHT"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.\n\n ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? \n   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that\'s a new position for N.\n\n But we don\'t know about B, I, S, O.\n\n I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? \n\n However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.\n\n I\'ll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:\n- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""night""\n  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n  I: x (not in word)\n  G: x (not in word)\n  H: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAnd the letter \'N\' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes \'N\' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).\n- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don\'t know which one, but we can use other N\'s? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple N\'s, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can\'t be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: \nForbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T\nKnown present: N (but position unknown)\n\nSo available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)\n\nWe need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven\'t tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:\n- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nBut wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven\'t tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.\n\nBut note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.\n\nSo ""UNLIT"" is invalid.\n\nHow about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.\n\n""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? \nS: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _\nFor example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.\n""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.\n""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": \nB(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that\'s a possibility.\n\nBut we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include N.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: \n""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? \nP(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in the 4th.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nExample: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.\n""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \nF(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable? \nBut we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, U, K, Y.\n\nAlternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N\nExample: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.\n""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.\n""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.\n""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.\n\nSo we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.\n- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.\n- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.\n\nBut wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.\n\nWe also note that we have not tested the letter O. It\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven\'t tested and also tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""SNOWY"" is okay.\n\nWith N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N\'s? And U and Y. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N\'s and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N\'s, we might get two marks for N? But we don\'t know if there are two. Also, we are using two N\'s when we might test two new letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N\'s in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. It\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: \n- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.\n- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.\n- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).\n\nWe also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.\n\nWe want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven\'t tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.\n\nSo the remaining vowels are O and U.\n\n""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.\n""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).\n""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).\n\nI think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it\'s in the 3rd we get a \'-\' and we know it\'s not in 2nd, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven\'t tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N\'s? And it\'s 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".\n\nIf we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nSo, I choose ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven\'t tested B, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.\n\nWe want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.\n\nSo ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.\n\nAlso, note that we haven\'t tested O, which is a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N.

All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).\n\n So I\'ll go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a \'-\', then we know N must be in the 3rd.\n\n Also, we test B, L, O, W.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".\n\n However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a \'-\' for N and then we know it\'s in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.\n\n How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.\n\n How about ""UNCLO"": \n   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNDID"": \n   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNFIT"": \n   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNPIN"": \n   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N\'s? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven\'t tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got \'-\', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven\'t tested 3rd.\n\n However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.\n\n Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.\n\n How about ""LUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""PUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""HUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""WENCH"": same.\n\n How about ""DUNCE"": \n   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""DUNGE"": \n   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""FUNKY"": \n   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). \n   But we haven\'t tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? \n   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it\'s valid.\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a \'-\', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that\'s the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.\n\n So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.\n\n Now, we have two options: \n   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)\n   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)\n\n Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.\n\n We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.\n\n We can choose either. Let\'s choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.\n\n But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a \'-\', then we know N is in the 5th.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can\'t because we have to put N in one position.\n\n We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.\n\n But we have to decide.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.\n\n ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? \n\n But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.\n\n I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.\n\n Both are valid. I\'ll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.\n\n Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.\n\n So let\'s go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".\n\n<guess>blown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2.

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""blown"":
 B: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is B!
 L: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 W: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 5th position) -> so N is in the word but not in the 5th. Since we already know N is in the word and not in 1,2,4 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for N is 3rd.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word starts with B (position 1 is B).
 - The secret word has N in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, and now also absent: O, W, L.

 So the full list of absent letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 And we know the word is of the form: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd, 4th, and 5th positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: We have to avoid: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 So available letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (but note B is already used at the start, but it can appear again? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters, so we cannot rule out duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicates so far. We should avoid using B again? Because we already know the first letter is B and we haven't tested B in other positions? Actually, we don't know if B appears again. But to be safe, we can avoid using B in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have tested B only in the first position and it was correct. We don't know if B appears again. But we can use B again? However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use it.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 The word pattern: B _ N _ _

 We need to choose a word that fits: B _ N _ _

 And uses only available letters (and we can use B again? but we don't know).

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list the available letters: 
   B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z

 But note: we already used B in the first position. If we use B again, we are testing if there is a second B? But we don't have any information about duplicates. So we can try.

 But to maximize information, we might avoid using B again and test new letters.

 So, we need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we can avoid B for now? but we don't have to).

 However, we know that the word has N in the 3rd, so the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We can try a word that has, say, U in the 2nd and then M in the 4th and Y in the 5th: ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? And we know N is in the 3rd. Also, ""BUNNY"" has N in the 2nd and 5th? But we are putting N in the 3rd? Actually, in ""BUNNY"": 
   B(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting N in the 3rd (which is correct) and also in the 4th? We know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNCH"": 
   B, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"": 
   B, A, N, D, Y -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONEY"": 
   B, O, N, E, Y -> O and E forbidden.

 How about ""BONNY"": 
   B, O, N, N, Y -> O forbidden and N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNNY"": same.

 How about ""FUNNY"": 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> O forbidden and N in the 3rd and 4th? Also, we know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 We are having trouble. 

 How about we try a word that doesn't have N in the 4th? We know N is in the 3rd, so we can only use N in the 3rd? And we cannot put it in the 4th or 5th? Actually, we can put it in the 5th? But we know from the feedback of ""blown"" that N is not in the 5th? 
   In ""blown"": we had N in the 5th and got a '-', meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. So we know N is not in the 5th. Therefore, the only position left for N is the 3rd.

 So we must have N in the 3rd.

 Therefore, the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z.

 Let's try to form a word: 
   Position 1: B (fixed)
   Position 2: ? (must be from D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   Position 3: N (fixed)
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

 Example: ""BUNNY"" is invalid because of the 4th N and the 5th Y. But we know the 4th cannot be N.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"": 
   B, O, N, K, Y -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKY"": 
   B, U, N, K, Y -> 
        B1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        U, K, Y are available? 
        But we haven't tested U, K, Y.

 This word: ""BUNKY"" -> is it valid? It means cozy or comfortable. Yes, it's a word.

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th.

 So, let's consider ""BUNKY"".

 But we have to check: 
   Position 2: U -> we haven't tested U.
   Position 4: K -> we haven't tested K.
   Position 5: Y -> we haven't tested Y.

 And we avoid all forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""BUNKY"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""BUNNY"" is invalid. 

 How about ""MUNGE""? Forbidden letters.

 How about ""PUNKY"": 
   P, U, N, K, Y -> 
        P1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters.

 ""PUNKY"" is a word (meaning sassy or rebellious).

 But we have to choose between ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are anagrams? 
   BUNKY: B, U, N, K, Y -> same letters as PUNKY? 
   PUNKY: P, U, N, K, Y -> same.

 So either is fine. We can choose one.

 But note: we have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We are testing U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th for both.

 We don't have any information about U, K, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? The most common available letters are: U, D, F, M, P, K, Y.

 ""BUNKY"" uses U, K, Y.
 ""PUNKY"" uses P, U, K, Y.

 We haven't tested U, K, Y at all.

 Another word: ""BUNKS"" -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the best options.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are both valid.

 But we don't have any information about the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses D or F? 

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common words.

 Another one: ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""MUMMY"": 
   M, U, M, M, Y -> but we have three M's? And we don't know if M is in the word. But we haven't tested M. 
   However, we are putting N in the 3rd? ""MUMMY"" has no N? We must include N.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the main options.

 Let me choose ""BUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd. We haven't tested U. Similarly, K in the 4th and Y in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"" to test P instead of B? But we already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So both are valid.

 I'll go with ""BUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""PUNKY""? We don't know. We have to guess one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters? But we are constrained by the pattern B _ N _ _ and the available letters.

 Another word: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common ones.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> 
        F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        But we have to avoid using F? We haven't tested F. And we are testing U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing F in the first position? We already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So ""FUNKY"" is a valid word and tests F, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B as the first letter. So if we use ""FUNKY"", we are:
   F (new) in position 1 -> but we know position 1 is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in position 1, but what if the word has B in the first and also elsewhere? We don't know. But we are using B in the first position. However, we are testing F in the first. If the word has F, then we get information.

 But we are also testing U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"": P in the first, U in the second, N in the third, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 We have two options: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 Let me choose ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter? Or ""BUNKY"" because B is already known? But we are using B again? We don't know if B appears again. But we can test.

 However, we are more interested in getting the word right than in testing new letters? We have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions.

 But note: we have to use the pattern B _ N _ _.

 We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B in the first, so we are effectively testing P in the first? But we don't know if the first letter is P or B? We know it's B, so if we put B in the first, we get a ✓, and we test the other positions.

 Alternatively, if we put P in the first and it's correct, then we know the first letter is P. But we know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first, but what if the word has B in the first and also another B? We don't know.

 But we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.

 I think ""PUNKY"" is a word and we haven't tested P, U, K, Y.

 So let's choose ""PUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting N in the 3rd, which we know is correct. We are testing P in the first, U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 If we get:
   P: if correct, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B (and we already know B is in the first, so it must be B). But wait, if we put P in the first and it's not correct, then we know the first letter must be B? Because we have B as correct in the first? Actually, we have B as correct in the first, so if the word is ""BUNKY"", then P would be absent? But we are testing P in the first. If P is absent, then we know the first letter is B (because we have B as correct in the first) and then the word is ""BUNKY"" (if we get U correct and K and Y also). But we are testing U in the second.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the feedback is:
   P: if ✓ then first letter is P, and we test U, K, Y.
   If P is absent, then the first letter must be B, and we get a ✓ for B (again) and then we test U, K, Y for the second, fourth, fifth positions.

 But we already know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it's absent, we don't learn anything new about the first position? Actually, we know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it's absent, then we know the first letter is B and the word is ""BUNKY"" (if U is correct, etc.).

 However, we have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.

 I think we should choose one. Let's choose ""PUNKY"" because it tests P, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and the word is ""BUNKY"".

 So we can guess ""PUNKY"". If it's not correct, then we know it's ""BUNKY"".

 But we have to make sure we have enough guesses. We have 4 left? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? We used 4 guesses? Let me count:
   Guess 1: crane
   Guess 2: night
   Guess 3: snowy
   Guess 4: blown

 So we have 2 more guesses? Actually, the game gives 6 tries, so we have 2 left.

 We can guess ""PUNKY"" and if it's not correct, then we guess ""BUNKY"" next.

 But we can also try to test more letters? We have to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions.

 We know the pattern: B _ N _ _

 We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.

 But we can also try a word that uses different letters? For example, we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we don't have many options.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses different letters? But we are constrained.

 Another idea: we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we don't know which one.

 I think we should guess ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So let's guess ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get it in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? But we have to use the pattern.

 We can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we have to choose one.

 I'll go with ""PUNKY"" because P is more common than U? Actually, in English, P is more common than U? 

 But let's see the frequency: 
   P: very common
   U: common
   K: common
   Y: common

 So ""PUNKY"" tests P, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So, I choose ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get:
   P: absent (x) because the first letter is B, not P.
   U: ? 
   N: ✓ (we know it's in the 3rd)
   K: ?
   Y: ?

 Then we would know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it.

 But if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the word is ""BUNKY"", then we get:
   P: x (absent)
   U: ? 
   N: ✓
   K: ? 
   Y: ?

 Then we know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it in the next turn.

 So it's safe.

 Therefore, I choose ""PUNKY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.
- **Guess 4 (""blown"")**: 
  - B is **correct** in position 1 (✓).
  - L, O, W, N are absent (x).  
  - This means:  
    - N is not in position 5 (since we got ""-"" for N in position 5).  
    - L, O, W are new absent letters.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **B** (from Guess 4).  
   - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4 feedback: N is in the word but not in position 5, and we already knew it wasn't in positions 1–4).  
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L (12 letters eliminated).  
3. **Word pattern**: The secret word is **B _ N _ _**.  
4. **Remaining possibilities**:  
   - N must be in position 3 (only remaining slot).  
   - Valid letters for other positions: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (since A–L are eliminated).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on position 2, 4, and 5**: Use new, common letters from the available set to test the unknown positions.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: U, K, Y, M, P, D (most common untested letters).  
- **Candidate words**:  
  - **""PUNKY""**: Tests P (position 1), U (position 2), K (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - **""BUNKY""**: Tests B (position 1) again and U, K, Y.  
- **Why ""PUNKY""?**  
  - Tests P in position 1 (if correct, we lock position 1; if absent, position 1 must be B, and we can guess ""BUNKY"" next).  
  - Covers high-frequency letters: P, U, K, Y.  
  - Avoids reusing absent letters.  

### Next Guess: **""PUNKY""**
- Tests the pattern **B _ N _ _** with N fixed in position 3.  
- Maximizes new information:  
  - If P is ✓, we lock position 1.  
  - If U is ✓, we lock position 2.  
  - If K is ✓, we lock position 4.  
  - If Y is ✓, we lock position 5.  
- Failsafe: If all other positions are absent, the word must be **""BUNKY""** (since N is fixed in position 3).  

<guess>punky</guess>",punky,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""blown"":
 B: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is B!
 L: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 W: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 5th position) -> so N is in the word but not in the 5th. Since we already know N is in the word and not in 1,2,4 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for N is 3rd.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word starts with B (position 1 is B).
 - The secret word has N in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, and now also absent: O, W, L.

 So the full list of absent letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 And we know the word is of the form: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd, 4th, and 5th positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: We have to avoid: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 So available letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (but note B is already used at the start, but it can appear again? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters, so we cannot rule out duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicates so far. We should avoid using B again? Because we already know the first letter is B and we haven't tested B in other positions? Actually, we don't know if B appears again. But to be safe, we can avoid using B in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have tested B only in the first position and it was correct. We don't know if B appears again. But we can use B again? However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use it.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 The word pattern: B _ N _ _

 We need to choose a word that fits: B _ N _ _

 And uses only available letters (and we can use B again? but we don't know).

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list the available letters: 
   B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z

 But note: we already used B in the first position. If we use B again, we are testing if there is a second B? But we don't have any information about duplicates. So we can try.

 But to maximize information, we might avoid using B again and test new letters.

 So, we need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we can avoid B for now? but we don't have to).

 However, we know that the word has N in the 3rd, so the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We can try a word that has, say, U in the 2nd and then M in the 4th and Y in the 5th: ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? And we know N is in the 3rd. Also, ""BUNNY"" has N in the 2nd and 5th? But we are putting N in the 3rd? Actually, in ""BUNNY"": 
   B(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting N in the 3rd (which is correct) and also in the 4th? We know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNCH"": 
   B, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"": 
   B, A, N, D, Y -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONEY"": 
   B, O, N, E, Y -> O and E forbidden.

 How about ""BONNY"": 
   B, O, N, N, Y -> O forbidden and N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNNY"": same.

 How about ""FUNNY"": 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> O forbidden and N in the 3rd and 4th? Also, we know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 We are having trouble. 

 How about we try a word that doesn't have N in the 4th? We know N is in the 3rd, so we can only use N in the 3rd? And we cannot put it in the 4th or 5th? Actually, we can put it in the 5th? But we know from the feedback of ""blown"" that N is not in the 5th? 
   In ""blown"": we had N in the 5th and got a '-', meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. So we know N is not in the 5th. Therefore, the only position left for N is the 3rd.

 So we must have N in the 3rd.

 Therefore, the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z.

 Let's try to form a word: 
   Position 1: B (fixed)
   Position 2: ? (must be from D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   Position 3: N (fixed)
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

 Example: ""BUNNY"" is invalid because of the 4th N and the 5th Y. But we know the 4th cannot be N.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"": 
   B, O, N, K, Y -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKY"": 
   B, U, N, K, Y -> 
        B1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        U, K, Y are available? 
        But we haven't tested U, K, Y.

 This word: ""BUNKY"" -> is it valid? It means cozy or comfortable. Yes, it's a word.

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th.

 So, let's consider ""BUNKY"".

 But we have to check: 
   Position 2: U -> we haven't tested U.
   Position 4: K -> we haven't tested K.
   Position 5: Y -> we haven't tested Y.

 And we avoid all forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""BUNKY"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""BUNNY"" is invalid. 

 How about ""MUNGE""? Forbidden letters.

 How about ""PUNKY"": 
   P, U, N, K, Y -> 
        P1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters.

 ""PUNKY"" is a word (meaning sassy or rebellious).

 But we have to choose between ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are anagrams? 
   BUNKY: B, U, N, K, Y -> same letters as PUNKY? 
   PUNKY: P, U, N, K, Y -> same.

 So either is fine. We can choose one.

 But note: we have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We are testing U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th for both.

 We don't have any information about U, K, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? The most common available letters are: U, D, F, M, P, K, Y.

 ""BUNKY"" uses U, K, Y.
 ""PUNKY"" uses P, U, K, Y.

 We haven't tested U, K, Y at all.

 Another word: ""BUNKS"" -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the best options.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are both valid.

 But we don't have any information about the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses D or F? 

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common words.

 Another one: ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""MUMMY"": 
   M, U, M, M, Y -> but we have three M's? And we don't know if M is in the word. But we haven't tested M. 
   However, we are putting N in the 3rd? ""MUMMY"" has no N? We must include N.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the main options.

 Let me choose ""BUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd. We haven't tested U. Similarly, K in the 4th and Y in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"" to test P instead of B? But we already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So both are valid.

 I'll go with ""BUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""PUNKY""? We don't know. We have to guess one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters? But we are constrained by the pattern B _ N _ _ and the available letters.

 Another word: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common ones.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> 
        F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        But we have to avoid using F? We haven't tested F. And we are testing U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing F in the first position? We already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So ""FUNKY"" is a valid word and tests F, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B as the first letter. So if we use ""FUNKY"", we are:
   F (new) in position 1 -> but we know position 1 is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in position 1, but what if the word has B in the first and also elsewhere? We don't know. But we are using B in the first position. However, we are testing F in the first. If the word has F, then we get information.

 But we are also testing U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"": P in the first, U in the second, N in the third, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 We have two options: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 Let me choose ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter? Or ""BUNKY"" because B is already known? But we are using B again? We don't know if B appears again. But we can test.

 However, we are more interested in getting the word right than in testing new letters? We have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions.

 But note: we have to use the pattern B _ N _ _.

 We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B in the first, so we are effectively testing P in the first? But we don't know if the first letter is P or B? We know it's B, so if we put B in the first, we get a ✓, and we test the other positions.

 Alternatively, if we put P in the first and it's correct, then we know the first letter is P. But we know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first, but what if the word has B in the first and also another B? We don't know.

 But we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.

 I think ""PUNKY"" is a word and we haven't tested P, U, K, Y.

 So let's choose ""PUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting N in the 3rd, which we know is correct. We are testing P in the first, U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 If we get:
   P: if correct, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B (and we already know B is in the first, so it must be B). But wait, if we put P in the first and it's not correct, then we know the first letter must be B? Because we have B as correct in the first? Actually, we have B as correct in the first, so if the word is ""BUNKY"", then P would be absent? But we are testing P in the first. If P is absent, then we know the first letter is B (because we have B as correct in the first) and then the word is ""BUNKY"" (if we get U correct and K and Y also). But we are testing U in the second.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the feedback is:
   P: if ✓ then first letter is P, and we test U, K, Y.

 Another idea: we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we don't know which one.

 I think we should guess ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So let's guess ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get it in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? But we have to use the pattern.

 We can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we have to choose one.

 I'll go with ""PUNKY"" because P is more common than U? Actually, in English, P is more common than U? 

 But let's see the frequency: 
   P: very common
   U: common
   K: common
   Y: common

 So ""PUNKY"" tests P, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So, I choose ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get:
   P: absent (x) because the first letter is B, not P.
   U: ? 
   N: ✓ (we know it's in the 3rd)
   K: ?
   Y: ?

 Then we would know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it.

 But if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the word is ""BUNKY"", then we get:
   P: x (absent)
   U: ? 
   N: ✓
   K: ? 
   Y: ?

 Then we know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it in the next turn.

 So it's safe.

 Therefore, I choose ""PUNKY"".

<guess>punky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.
- **Guess 4 (""blown"")**: 
  - B is **correct** in position 1 (✓).
  - L, O, W, N are absent (x).  
  - This means:  
    - N is not in position 5 (since we got ""-"" for N in position 5).  
    - L, O, W are new absent letters.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **B** (from Guess 4).  
   - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4 feedback: N is in the word but not in position 5, and we already knew it wasn't in positions 1–4).  
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L (12 letters eliminated).  
3. **Word pattern**: The secret word is **B _ N _ _**.  
4. **Remaining possibilities**:  
   - N must be in position 3 (only remaining slot).  
   - Valid letters for other positions: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (since A–L are eliminated).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on position 2, 4, and 5**: Use new, common letters from the available set to test the unknown positions.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: U, K, Y, M, P, D (most common untested letters).  
- **Candidate words**:  
  - **""PUNKY""**: Tests P (position 1), U (position 2), K (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - **""BUNKY""**: Tests B (position 1) again and U, K, Y.  
- **Why ""PUNKY""?**  
  - Tests P in position 1 (if correct, we lock position 1; if absent, position 1 must be B, and we can guess ""BUNKY"" next).  
  - Covers high-frequency letters: P, U, K, Y.  
  - Avoids reusing absent letters.  

### Next Guess: **""PUNKY""**
- Tests the pattern **B _ N _ _** with N fixed in position 3.  
- Maximizes new information:  
  - If P is ✓, we lock position 1.  
  - If U is ✓, we lock position 2.  
  - If K is ✓, we lock position 4.  
  - If Y is ✓, we lock position 5.  
- Failsafe: If all other positions are absent, the word must be **""BUNKY""** (since N is fixed in position 3).",Guess 5: punky -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(x) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter 'N' is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the 4th and got a '-' meaning present but wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter 'N' and does not contain C, R, A, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes 'N' (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the 4th.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, E.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also note that the word must have 5 letters and be a valid English word.

 Since 'N' is in the word but not in the 4th position, we can try placing 'N' in a different position.

 Possible positions for 'N': 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

 We also want to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don't have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.

 However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).

 Let's try to form a word that includes 'N' and uses other common letters.

 Idea: Start with a word that has 'N' in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'N' in a different position than 4.

 Example words:
 - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, 'N' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, 'N' was in the 4th position and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put 'N' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting 'N' in the 4th.

 Therefore, we need a word that has 'N' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 Let's try to find a word with 'N' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don't know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with 'N' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.

 So, we must avoid E and A.

 Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.

 Possibilities:
 - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.
 - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven't tested.
 - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven't tested T, H, I, K.

 But wait: we know that the word has an 'N', so we can try to use it.

 However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

 Let me list some words that fit:
 - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.

 Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.

 We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn't make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.

 So, let's try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: 
   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.

 But we don't know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""NOISY"": 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.

 Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters.

 Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.

 So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.

 However, we don't know if U, L, I, T are in the word.

 Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

 How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.

 Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.

 Some options:
 - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": 
        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.

 But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that's 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know if the word has O, I, T, P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? 
   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.

 How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? 
   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we don't know about S, O, W, Y.

 Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's. But it's allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don't know if the word has two N's.

 However, we are trying to get information. Using two N's might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's try a word with one N for now.

 I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: 
   N (1), O, I, S, Y.

 This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven't tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.

 Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can't because N is in the 4th.

 How about ""NIGHT"": 
   N(1), I, G, H, T.

 This avoids A, E, R, C.

 Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.

 I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.

 Let me check: 
   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
   I: new letter
   G: new letter
   H: new letter
   T: new letter

 This will give us information about these letters.

 Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that's acceptable? 
   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? 
   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that's a new position.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. Both are common.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.

 How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable.

 But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.

 However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.

 Let me go with ""NIGHT"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.

 ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? 
   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that's a new position for N.

 But we don't know about B, I, S, O.

 I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? 

 However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.

 I'll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.

 So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.
- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.

The word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:
- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).

<guess>night</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""night""
  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.
  I: x (not in word)
  G: x (not in word)
  H: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, combining the information:
- The secret word contains the letter 'N' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

We also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

And the letter 'N' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Includes 'N' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).
- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don't know which one, but we can use other N's? Actually, we don't know if there are multiple N's, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can't be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.

Let's list the available letters: 
Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T
Known present: N (but position unknown)

So available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)

We need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.

Let's try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don't know if that's the case. We are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

We know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven't tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me try to form words:

Option 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _
We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:
- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.

But note: we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.

However, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.

But wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven't tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.

But note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.

Another word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.

So ""UNLIT"" is invalid.

How about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.

""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
S: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.

But we don't know if the word has S, O, W, Y.

Alternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _
For example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.
""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.
""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": 
B(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that's a possibility.

But we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.
""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include N.

So for N in the 3rd: 
""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? 
P(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.

We must avoid putting N in the 4th.

So for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

Example: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.
""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that's acceptable? 
But we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.

But note: we don't know if the word has F, U, K, Y.

Alternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N
Example: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.
""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.
""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.
""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.

So we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.

Let me list some candidates:

- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.
- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.
- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.

But wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.

However, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.

We also note that we have not tested the letter O. It's a common vowel.

So let's consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven't tested and also tests more common letters.

Another word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.
""SNOWY"" is okay.

With N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N's? And U and Y. But note: we don't know if the word has two N's. But it's possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N's and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N's, we might get two marks for N? But we don't know if there are two. Also, we are using two N's when we might test two new letters.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.

But we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N's in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don't know. It's risky.

Alternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.

But let's see the letters: 
- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.
- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.
- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).

We also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.

We want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven't tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.

So the remaining vowels are O and U.

""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.
""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).
""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).

I think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.

So I'll go with ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it's in the 3rd we get a '-' and we know it's not in 2nd, etc.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven't tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.

Another candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that's 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N's? And it's 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.

So let's stick with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".

If we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.

So, I choose ""SNOWY"".

But wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven't tested B, L, O, W.

Similarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.

We want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.

So ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.

Also, note that we haven't tested O, which is a common vowel.

So let's go with ""SNOWY"".

But note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a '-' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.

Therefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".

<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I'll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").
- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.

The word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:
- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>snowy</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the third guess ""snowy"":
 S: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 2nd position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position? Actually, we know from guess1 that N is not in 4th, from guess2 that not in 1st, and now from guess3 that not in 2nd. Therefore, the only possibility is that N is in the 3rd position? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and we have ruled out 1,2,4 and now 2? Actually, we have ruled out 1 (from guess2), 2 (from guess3), and 4 (from guess1). So the 3rd position is the only one left? But wait, we also have 5th? We haven't tested the 5th.

 However, we know that N must be in the word and is not in any of the positions we've tried and gotten wrong. So the 3rd position is a candidate. But we haven't tested the 5th? We can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have N in the 5th. We haven't tested the 5th position for N.

 Actually, we have tested:
 - 1st: guess2 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 1st
 - 2nd: guess3 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 2nd
 - 4th: guess1 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 4th

 And we haven't tested 3rd and 5th.

 But in guess3, we put N in the 2nd and got a '-', meaning it's in the word but not in the 2nd. So we know N is not in 2nd. Similarly, we know it's not in 1st, 4th. So the only position left is 3rd? But wait, what about 5th? We haven't tested 5th.

 Actually, we can test the 5th in the next guess.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has the letter N.
 - N is not in position 1, 2, 4 (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, guess3 respectively) -> so the only possibility is position 3 or 5.

 We have two candidates: 3rd and 5th.

 We can try to test both? But we can only test one at a time.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use 5 letters.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B, L, O, W, N -> but we put N in the 5th? 
   In ""BLOWN"": B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> so we are testing the 5th position for N.

 But we also want to test the 3rd? We can do that in a later guess.

 However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
 Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So B, L, O, W, N are allowed.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it's in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And if we get an 'x'? But we know N is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

 But we are also testing B, L, O, W in the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th positions.

 So, let's consider ""BLOWN"". 

 However, we have to be cautious: what if the word has two N's? We don't know. But we are only required to have at least one N.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 How about ""FUNNY""? 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> but we are putting N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid because it has N in the 4th? Actually, ""FUNNY"" has N in the 3rd and 4th? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). 
   But we know that N is not in the 4th (from guess1), so we cannot use the 4th position for N. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY""? Same issue: B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N.

 So we avoid.

 How about ""BLOWN"": 
   B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> N is in the 5th and only the 3rd is left? But we are testing the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use one N.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> but N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": 
   B, O, U, N, D -> N in the 4th? Same issue.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd? Or in the 5th.

 Let me think of words with N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   Example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. 
   ""PLANK"" -> A forbidden.
   ""CLANK"" -> C forbidden.

 How about ""STUNK"": 
   S, T, U, N, K -> but S and T are forbidden? T is forbidden (from guess2) and S is forbidden (from guess3). So no.

 How about ""JUMPS"": no N.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N? So we cannot use the 4th.

 How about ""DUNNY"": 
   D, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, 4th is invalid.

 We must avoid the 4th for N.

 So, how about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, same issue.

 How about ""MINTY"": 
   M, I, N, T, Y -> but I and T are forbidden. No.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H are forbidden. No.

 How about ""LUNGY"": 
   L, U, N, G, Y -> G is forbidden (from guess2). No.

 How about ""XENON"": 
   X, E, N, O, N -> E is forbidden. No.

 How about ""BLOWN"" we already have: B, L, O, W, N -> N in the 5th. And the letters B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? 
   B: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, W: allowed, N: known present.

 So ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd (because that's the only other possibility). And we get information about B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are having trouble finding one without forbidden letters.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.

 How about ""BLOND"" is invalid. What about ""BLAND""? A forbidden.

 How about ""PLUMB"": 
   P, L, U, M, B -> no N? We must include N.

 How about ""UNCLIP"": too long.

 We need a word that has N in the 3rd: 
   _ _ N _ _
   How about ""BORNS""? Not a word. 
   ""BORNE"" -> E forbidden.
   ""HORNS"": H and R forbidden? H is forbidden (from guess2) and R is forbidden (from guess1). 

 How about ""WOMAN"": 
   W, O, M, A, N -> A forbidden.

 How about ""YOGIN"": 
   Y, O, G, I, N -> G and I forbidden.

 How about ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> E forbidden.

 How about ""KOINE"": 
   K, O, I, N, E -> I and E forbidden.

 I'm struggling. Maybe we should focus on the 5th position for now.

 Another word: ""BLOWN"" is one option. But we can also try ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of.

 Alternatively, ""BOWLN""? Not a word.

 Or ""BOWNS""? Not a word.

 How about ""BUNNY""? 
   B, U, N, N, Y -> but N is in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid. So we cannot use.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""MOUND"": 
   M, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""BOUND"": same.

 How about ""FOUND"": same.

 How about ""POUND"": same.

 How about ""WOUND"": 
   W, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   W(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""HOUND"": same.

 How about ""MOUND"": same.

 How about ""BLAND"": 
   B, L, A, N, D -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BLOND"": 
   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? 
   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.

 How about ""CLINK"": 
   C, L, I, N, K -> C and I forbidden.

 How about ""FLING"": 
   F, L, I, N, G -> I and G forbidden.

 How about ""SLING"": 
   S, L, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""STING"": 
   S, T, I, N, G -> S, T, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""SWING"": 
   S, W, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.

 How about ""BLUNT"": 
   B, L, U, N, T -> T forbidden.

 How about ""FLUNG"": 
   F, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""CLUNG"": 
   C, L, U, N, G -> C and G forbidden.

 How about ""PLUNG"": 
   P, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of that has N in the 5th and no forbidden letters? 
   B, L, O, W, N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4, N5.

 This uses B, L, O, W, N. All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 3rd.

 Also, we test B, L, O, W.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

 However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a '-' for N and then we know it's in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.

 How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.

 How about ""UNCLO"": 
   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.

 How about ""UNDID"": 
   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.

 How about ""UNFIT"": 
   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.

 How about ""UNPIN"": 
   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N's? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven't tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got '-', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven't tested 3rd.

 However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.

 Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.

 Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""LUNCH"": same.

 How about ""PUNCH"": same.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 How about ""HUNCH"": same.

 How about ""WENCH"": same.

 How about ""DUNCE"": 
   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.

 How about ""DUNGE"": 
   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? 
   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). 
   But we haven't tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it's valid.

 But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a '-', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that's the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.

 So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.

 Now, we have two options: 
   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)
   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)

 Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.

 We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.

 We can choose either. Let's choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a '-', then we know N is in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can't because we have to put N in one position.

 We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.

 But we have to decide.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.

 ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? 

 But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.

 I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 So I'll go with ""BLOWN"".

 But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a '-' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.

 Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.

 So let's go with ""BLOWN"".

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.

 Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".

<guess>blown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.

### Key Insights:
1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1, 2, or 4**. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, Y (cannot be used).
3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, L, U, M, P, F, K, V, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test N in position 5**: Since position 3 is the only other candidate for N, I'll test it in position 5 (using ""BLOWN"").
- **Test new common letters**: Use B, L, O, W (which are common and untested) to maximize information.
- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters are used.

The word **""BLOWN""** fits:
- Places N in position 5 (testing the only remaining possibility).
- Uses new common letters: B, L, O, W.
- Avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>blown</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: blown -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x) N(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""blown"":
 B: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is B!
 L: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 W: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but not in the 5th position) -> so N is in the word but not in the 5th. Since we already know N is in the word and not in 1,2,4 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for N is 3rd.

 Therefore, we now know:
 - The secret word starts with B (position 1 is B).
 - The secret word has N in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, and now also absent: O, W, L.

 So the full list of absent letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 And we know the word is of the form: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd, 4th, and 5th positions with letters that are not in the absent list.

 Available letters: We have to avoid: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.

 So available letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (but note B is already used at the start, but it can appear again? We don't know. The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters, so we cannot rule out duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicates so far. We should avoid using B again? Because we already know the first letter is B and we haven't tested B in other positions? Actually, we don't know if B appears again. But to be safe, we can avoid using B in positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have tested B only in the first position and it was correct. We don't know if B appears again. But we can use B again? However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use it.

 But note: we have to form a valid word.

 The word pattern: B _ N _ _

 We need to choose a word that fits: B _ N _ _

 And uses only available letters (and we can use B again? but we don't know).

 However, we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's list the available letters: 
   B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z

 But note: we already used B in the first position. If we use B again, we are testing if there is a second B? But we don't have any information about duplicates. So we can try.

 But to maximize information, we might avoid using B again and test new letters.

 So, we need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we can avoid B for now? but we don't have to).

 However, we know that the word has N in the 3rd, so the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We can try a word that has, say, U in the 2nd and then M in the 4th and Y in the 5th: ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N's? And we know N is in the 3rd. Also, ""BUNNY"" has N in the 2nd and 5th? But we are putting N in the 3rd? Actually, in ""BUNNY"": 
   B(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting N in the 3rd (which is correct) and also in the 4th? We know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""BUNCH"": 
   B, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"": 
   B, A, N, D, Y -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONEY"": 
   B, O, N, E, Y -> O and E forbidden.

 How about ""BONNY"": 
   B, O, N, N, Y -> O forbidden and N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNNY"": same.

 How about ""FUNNY"": 
   F, U, N, N, Y -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""DUNNO"": 
   D, U, N, N, O -> O forbidden and N in the 3rd and 4th? Also, we know the 4th is invalid.

 How about ""MUNGE"": 
   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.

 How about ""PUNCH"": 
   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"": same.

 We are having trouble. 

 How about we try a word that doesn't have N in the 4th? We know N is in the 3rd, so we can only use N in the 3rd? And we cannot put it in the 4th or 5th? Actually, we can put it in the 5th? But we know from the feedback of ""blown"" that N is not in the 5th? 
   In ""blown"": we had N in the 5th and got a '-', meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. So we know N is not in the 5th. Therefore, the only position left for N is the 3rd.

 So we must have N in the 3rd.

 Therefore, the pattern is: B _ N _ _

 We need to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z.

 Let's try to form a word: 
   Position 1: B (fixed)
   Position 2: ? (must be from D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z)
   Position 3: N (fixed)
   Position 4: ?
   Position 5: ?

 Example: ""BUNNY"" is invalid because of the 4th N and the 5th Y. But we know the 4th cannot be N.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"": 
   B, O, N, K, Y -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNKY"": 
   B, U, N, K, Y -> 
        B1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        U, K, Y are available? 
        But we haven't tested U, K, Y.

 This word: ""BUNKY"" -> is it valid? It means cozy or comfortable. Yes, it's a word.

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th.

 So, let's consider ""BUNKY"".

 But we have to check: 
   Position 2: U -> we haven't tested U.
   Position 4: K -> we haven't tested K.
   Position 5: Y -> we haven't tested Y.

 And we avoid all forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""BUNKY"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""BUNNY"" is invalid. 

 How about ""MUNGE""? Forbidden letters.

 How about ""PUNKY"": 
   P, U, N, K, Y -> 
        P1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters.

 ""PUNKY"" is a word (meaning sassy or rebellious).

 But we have to choose between ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are anagrams? 
   BUNKY: B, U, N, K, Y -> same letters as PUNKY? 
   PUNKY: P, U, N, K, Y -> same.

 So either is fine. We can choose one.

 But note: we have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We are testing U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th for both.

 We don't have any information about U, K, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? The most common available letters are: U, D, F, M, P, K, Y.

 ""BUNKY"" uses U, K, Y.
 ""PUNKY"" uses P, U, K, Y.

 We haven't tested U, K, Y at all.

 Another word: ""BUNKS"" -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> C and H forbidden.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> O forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the best options.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we can try.

 However, we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are both valid.

 But we don't have any information about the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses D or F? 

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common words.

 Another one: ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

 How about ""MUMMY"": 
   M, U, M, M, Y -> but we have three M's? And we don't know if M is in the word. But we haven't tested M. 
   However, we are putting N in the 3rd? ""MUMMY"" has no N? We must include N.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the main options.

 Let me choose ""BUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting U in the 2nd. We haven't tested U. Similarly, K in the 4th and Y in the 5th.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"" to test P instead of B? But we already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So both are valid.

 I'll go with ""BUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""PUNKY""? We don't know. We have to guess one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters? But we are constrained by the pattern B _ N _ _ and the available letters.

 Another word: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common ones.

 How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKS"": 
   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""FUNKY"": 
   F, U, N, K, Y -> 
        F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? 
        But we have to avoid using F? We haven't tested F. And we are testing U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing F in the first position? We already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don't have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.

 So ""FUNKY"" is a valid word and tests F, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B as the first letter. So if we use ""FUNKY"", we are:
   F (new) in position 1 -> but we know position 1 is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in position 1, but what if the word has B in the first and also elsewhere? We don't know. But we are using B in the first position. However, we are testing F in the first. If the word has F, then we get information.

 But we are also testing U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"": P in the first, U in the second, N in the third, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 We have two options: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 Let me choose ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter? Or ""BUNKY"" because B is already known? But we are using B again? We don't know if B appears again. But we can test.

 However, we are more interested in getting the word right than in testing new letters? We have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions.

 But note: we have to use the pattern B _ N _ _.

 We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.

 But we already have B in the first, so we are effectively testing P in the first? But we don't know if the first letter is P or B? We know it's B, so if we put B in the first, we get a ✓, and we test the other positions.

 Alternatively, if we put P in the first and it's correct, then we know the first letter is P. But we know the first letter is B? Actually, we don't know for sure. We have B as correct in the first, but what if the word has B in the first and also another B? We don't know.

 But we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.

 I think ""PUNKY"" is a word and we haven't tested P, U, K, Y.

 So let's choose ""PUNKY"".

 But note: we are putting N in the 3rd, which we know is correct. We are testing P in the first, U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.

 If we get:
   P: if correct, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B (and we already know B is in the first, so it must be B). But wait, if we put P in the first and it's not correct, then we know the first letter must be B? Because we have B as correct in the first? Actually, we have B as correct in the first, so if the word is ""BUNKY"", then P would be absent? But we are testing P in the first. If P is absent, then we know the first letter is B (because we have B as correct in the first) and then the word is ""BUNKY"" (if we get U correct and K and Y also). But we are testing U in the second.

 Alternatively, if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the feedback is:
   P: if ✓ then first letter is P, and we test U, K, Y.
   If P is absent, then the first letter must be B, and we get a ✓ for B (again) and then we test U, K, Y for the second, fourth, fifth positions.

 But we already know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it's absent, we don't learn anything new about the first position? Actually, we know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it's absent, then we know the first letter is B and the word is ""BUNKY"" (if U is correct, etc.).

 However, we have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". 

 We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.

 Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.

 How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.

 I think we should choose one. Let's choose ""PUNKY"" because it tests P, which is a common letter.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and the word is ""BUNKY"".

 So we can guess ""PUNKY"". If it's not correct, then we know it's ""BUNKY"".

 But we have to make sure we have enough guesses. We have 4 left? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? We used 4 guesses? Let me count:
   Guess 1: crane
   Guess 2: night
   Guess 3: snowy
   Guess 4: blown

 So we have 2 more guesses? Actually, the game gives 6 tries, so we have 2 left.

 We can guess ""PUNKY"" and if it's not correct, then we guess ""BUNKY"" next.

 But we can also try to test more letters? We have to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions.

 We know the pattern: B _ N _ _

 We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.

 But we can also try a word that uses different letters? For example, we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we don't have many options.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses different letters? But we are constrained.

 Another idea: we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we don't know which one.

 I think we should guess ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So let's guess ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get it in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? But we have to use the pattern.

 We can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.

 But we have to choose one.

 I'll go with ""PUNKY"" because P is more common than U? Actually, in English, P is more common than U? 

 But let's see the frequency: 
   P: very common
   U: common
   K: common
   Y: common

 So ""PUNKY"" tests P, U, K, Y.

 But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it's B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".

 So, I choose ""PUNKY"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get:
   P: absent (x) because the first letter is B, not P.
   U: ? 
   N: ✓ (we know it's in the 3rd)
   K: ?
   Y: ?

 Then we would know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it.

 But if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the word is ""BUNKY"", then we get:
   P: x (absent)
   U: ? 
   N: ✓
   K: ? 
   Y: ?

 Then we know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it in the next turn.

 So it's safe.

 Therefore, I choose ""PUNKY"".

<guess>punky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.
- **Guess 4 (""blown"")**: 
  - B is **correct** in position 1 (✓).
  - L, O, W, N are absent (x).  
  - This means:  
    - N is not in position 5 (since we got ""-"" for N in position 5).  
    - L, O, W are new absent letters.  

### Key Insights:
1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **B** (from Guess 4).  
   - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4 feedback: N is in the word but not in position 5, and we already knew it wasn't in positions 1–4).  
2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L (12 letters eliminated).  
3. **Word pattern**: The secret word is **B _ N _ _**.  
4. **Remaining possibilities**:  
   - N must be in position 3 (only remaining slot).  
   - Valid letters for other positions: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (since A–L are eliminated).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Focus on position 2, 4, and 5**: Use new, common letters from the available set to test the unknown positions.  
- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: U, K, Y, M, P, D (most common untested letters).  
- **Candidate words**:  
  - **""PUNKY""**: Tests P (position 1), U (position 2), K (position 4), Y (position 5).  
  - **""BUNKY""**: Tests B (position 1) again and U, K, Y.  
- **Why ""PUNKY""?**  
  - Tests P in position 1 (if correct, we lock position 1; if absent, position 1 must be B, and we can guess ""BUNKY"" next).  
  - Covers high-frequency letters: P, U, K, Y.  
  - Avoids reusing absent letters.  

### Next Guess: **""PUNKY""**
- Tests the pattern **B _ N _ _** with N fixed in position 3.  
- Maximizes new information:  
  - If P is ✓, we lock position 1.  
  - If U is ✓, we lock position 2.  
  - If K is ✓, we lock position 4.  
  - If Y is ✓, we lock position 5.  
- Failsafe: If all other positions are absent, the word must be **""BUNKY""** (since N is fixed in position 3).

The remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). But note: we don\'t have A or E, so the vowels in the word might be I, O, U, or even Y.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, and also R (which we know is not in the word).\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes \'N\' and uses other common letters.\n\n Idea: Start with a word that has \'N\' in the first position? But we don\'t know if that\'s correct. Alternatively, we can try a word that has \'N\' in a different position than 4.\n\n Example words:\n - ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but note we have to avoid A, E, and R. This word uses O, I, T which are common. Also, \'N\' is in the 4th position? Wait, in ""POINT"": P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But in our feedback, \'N\' was in the 4th position and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 4th. So if we put \'N\' in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid putting \'N\' in the 4th.\n\n Therefore, we need a word that has \'N\' in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Let\'s try to find a word with \'N\' in position 1: e.g., ""NOISY"" -> but has S and Y, and we don\'t know about them. Also, we have to avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, I, etc. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with \'N\' in position 2: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but we know E is not in the word (from feedback: E was x) so we cannot use E. Similarly, we cannot use A.\n\n So, we must avoid E and A.\n\n Let me think of words without A, E, R, C and with N in a position other than 4.\n\n Possibilities:\n - N in position 1: ""NIGHT"", ""NOISY"", ""NUTTY"", etc.\n - N in position 2: ""SNOUT"", ""UNTIL"", but note U and I are vowels we haven\'t tested.\n - N in position 3: ""THINK"" -> but H and K are common? However, we have to avoid R and we did. But note: in ""THINK"", N is in the 3rd position. Also, we haven\'t tested T, H, I, K.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an \'N\', so we can try to use it.\n\n However, we must also consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n - ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th (and we know that position is wrong). So we avoid that.\n\n Instead, how about ""JOINT""? J is not very common. Or ""MOUNT"": M, O, U, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Again, same problem.\n\n We need to avoid the 4th position for N? Actually, no: the feedback only said that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was wrong. But it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? No, the feedback says it\'s in the word but wrong position, so it cannot be in the 4th? Actually, the feedback means that in the first guess, the N in the 4th was not correct, but it might be that the word has N in the 4th and we are wrong? That doesn\'t make sense because if it were in the 4th, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so the N is in the word but not in the 4th position. Therefore, in the secret word, N is not in the 4th position. So we should avoid putting N in the 4th in our next guess? Actually, we can put it anywhere, but if we put it in the 4th again, we know it will be wrong. So to get new information, we should try N in a different position.\n\n So, let\'s try to put N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good candidate: \n   N (position 1), I, G, H, T.\n\n But we don\'t know if G, H, T are in the word. Also, we avoid A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""NOISY"": \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This uses O, I, S, Y which are new.\n\n Another idea: ""UNLIT"" -> U, N, L, I, T -> N is in the 2nd position. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters.\n\n Let me check: forbidden letters: C, R, A, E.\n\n So, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> no C, R, A, E. And N is in the 2nd position.\n\n However, we don\'t know if U, L, I, T are in the word.\n\n Another common word: ""POINT"" is invalid because of the 4th position. But if we change to ""PUNT"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n How about ""POINT"" is 6 letters? We need 5.\n\n Let me think of 5-letter words without A, E, R, C and with N not in the 4th.\n\n Some options:\n - ""JOINT"": J, O, I, N, T -> N is in the 4th? Actually, in ""JOINT"": \n        J(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> so N is in the 4th. We know that the secret word does not have N in the 4th, so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""MINTS"": M, I, N, T, S -> N is in the 3rd position? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), S(5). So N is in the 3rd. This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, A, E are absent, so we are safe.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid because N is in the 4th. But if we use ""PINTO"", but that\'s 5 letters? P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has O, I, T, P.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LIONS"": L, I, O, N, S -> N is in the 4th? \n   L(1), I(2), O(3), N(4), S(5) -> again 4th position. So avoid.\n\n How about ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> N is in the 2nd position? \n   S(1), N(2), O(3), W(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, O, W, Y.\n\n Another: ""BUNCH"" -> but C is forbidden, so no.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses B, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Using two N\'s might not be efficient because we already know one N is present. But if we get two marks for N, we might know if there are two? But the feedback for the first guess only showed one N? Actually, the first guess had one N and it was marked as present. But the word might have more than one N? We don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try a word with one N for now.\n\n I think ""NOISY"" is a good candidate: \n   N (1), O, I, S, Y.\n\n This way, we test N in the first position (which we haven\'t tried) and we test O, I, S, Y.\n\n Another candidate: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""POINT"" we know the 4th position is wrong, but we can\'t because N is in the 4th.\n\n How about ""NIGHT"": \n   N(1), I, G, H, T.\n\n This avoids A, E, R, C.\n\n Alternatively, ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> N in the 2nd.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th. We are trying the 1st.\n\n I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n But wait: we know that the word does not have A, E, R, C. So we are safe.\n\n Let me check: \n   N: we are testing it in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n   I: new letter\n   G: new letter\n   H: new letter\n   T: new letter\n\n This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Another option: ""POINT"" is invalid. But if we use ""PINTO"", that\'s acceptable? \n   P, I, N, T, O -> N is in the 3rd? \n   P(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), O(5). So that\'s a new position.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. Both are common.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is a good choice because it uses very common letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""TOPAZ"" -> but T, O, P, A, Z -> but A is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""TONIC"": T, O, N, I, C -> but C is forbidden. So no.\n\n How about ""MINTY"": M, I, N, T, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   M(1), I(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid A, E, R, C. This word uses M, I, N, T, Y -> no forbidden letters.\n\n However, I think ""NIGHT"" is more common and uses letters that are more frequent.\n\n Let me go with ""NIGHT"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 5th? For example, ""LEMON"" -> but E is forbidden. So no.\n\n ""BISON"": B, I, S, O, N -> N is in the 5th? \n   B(1), I(2), S(3), O(4), N(5). So that\'s a new position for N.\n\n But we don\'t know about B, I, S, O.\n\n I think both ""NIGHT"" and ""BISON"" are good. But ""BISON"" uses more common letters? \n\n However, we have to consider that we have only 5 letters left. We want to maximize information.\n\n I\'ll go with ""NIGHT"" because it tests N in the first position and we get to test I, G, H, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""NIGHT""\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""NIGHT"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""NIGHT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- N is in the word but **not in the 4th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in the 4th position**.\n- Avoid C, R, A, E entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., I, G, H, T) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""NIGHT""** fits these criteria:\n- Places N in the **1st position** (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: I, G, H, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E).\n\n<guess>night</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not in 4th position)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""night""\n  N: - (in word, but not in 1st position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st or 4th position? Actually, from guess1 we know not 4th, and from guess2 not 1st. So N must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n  I: x (not in word)\n  G: x (not in word)\n  H: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word contains the letter \'N\' and it is in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, E, I, G, H, T.\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAnd the letter \'N\' must be in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Includes \'N\' in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).\n- Does not use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the 9 forbidden ones (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) and minus the one we know (N is in, but we don\'t know which one, but we can use other N\'s? Actually, we don\'t know if there are multiple N\'s, but we should avoid using N in positions we know it can\'t be? Actually, we can use it in a position we think it might be, but we have three possibilities: 2,3,5.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried. The remaining common letters include: O, U, L, S, D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: \nForbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T\nKnown present: N (but position unknown)\n\nSo available consonants: B, D, F, K, L, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable vowels: O, U (and Y, which can be a vowel)\n\nWe need to form a word with N in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have N in the 2nd position? But note: we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe know the word has N, so we can try to place it in a position we haven\'t tested (2,3, or 5) and use other common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to form words:\n\nOption 1: N in the 2nd position: _ N _ _ _\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set. For example:\n- ""SNOWY"": S, N, O, W, Y -> but we have to check if the letters are allowed. S, O, W, Y are available? Yes, because they are not forbidden. But wait: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So S, O, W, Y are allowed.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y. We are testing.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider that we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nBut wait: ""SNOWY"" has N in the 2nd position. But we haven\'t tested the 2nd position for N? Actually, we are testing it.\n\nBut note: we know N is not in 1st or 4th, so 2nd is a candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""UNLIT"": U, N, L, I, T -> but I and T are forbidden? I is forbidden (from guess2: I=x) and T is forbidden (from guess2: T=x). So we cannot use I and T.\n\nSo ""UNLIT"" is invalid.\n\nHow about ""SNOUT"": S, N, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden. So no.\n\n""SNOWY"" seems okay: S, N, O, W, Y -> no forbidden letters? \nS: allowed, N: known present, O: allowed, W: allowed, Y: allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, O, W, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try N in the 3rd position: _ _ N _ _\nFor example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. No.\n""PLANK"": P, L, A, N, K -> A is forbidden. No.\n""BLOWN"": B, L, O, W, N -> N is in the 5th? Actually, in ""BLOWN"": \nB(1), L(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> so N is in the 5th? Then that\'s a possibility.\n\nBut we can try to put N in the 3rd: ""STUNK"": S, T, U, N, K -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> no N? We must include N because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include N.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: \n""PLUNK"": P, L, U, N, K -> N is in the 4th? \nP(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th? Actually, we know from the first guess that N is not in the 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""PLUNK"" is invalid because it puts N in the 4th.\n\nWe must avoid putting N in the 4th.\n\nSo for N in the 3rd: we need a word where N is in the 3rd and the 4th and 5th are other letters. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nExample: ""BUNCH"": B, U, N, C, H -> but C and H are forbidden. No.\n""FUNKY"": F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \nF(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). So that\'s acceptable? \nBut we have to check: F, U, N, K, Y -> are these forbidden? No. So ""FUNKY"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has F, U, K, Y.\n\nAlternatively, N in the 5th: _ _ _ _ N\nExample: ""TOPAZ"" -> but T and A are forbidden. No.\n""MAVEN"" -> M, A, V, E, N -> A and E are forbidden. No.\n""OZONE"" -> O, Z, O, N, E -> E is forbidden. No.\n""PHONE"" -> P, H, O, N, E -> H and E are forbidden. No.\n\nSo we need words without the forbidden letters and with N in position 2,3, or 5.\n\nLet me list some candidates:\n\n- N in 2nd: ""SNOWY"" (S, N, O, W, Y) -> positions: S1, N2, O3, W4, Y5.\n- N in 3rd: ""FUNKY"" (F, U, N, K, Y) -> F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5.\n- N in 5th: ""BLOWN"" (B, L, O, W, N) -> B1, L2, O3, W4, N5. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters: B, L, O, W, N -> yes, because N is allowed and the others are new.\n\nBut wait: in ""BLOWN"", the N is in the 5th, which is a candidate. And the letters B, L, O, W are allowed.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that we are testing multiple positions. We might want to test a position and also test other common letters.\n\nWe also note that we have not tested the letter O. It\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""SNOWY"" and ""BLOWN"". But we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position we haven\'t tested and also tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word with N in the 2nd: ""SNOUT"" -> but T is forbidden. No.\n""SNOWY"" is okay.\n\nWith N in the 3rd: ""FUNNY"" -> but two N\'s? And U and Y. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. But it\'s possible. However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""FUNNY"" has two N\'s and we already know one N is present. But if we use two N\'s, we might get two marks for N? But we don\'t know if there are two. Also, we are using two N\'s when we might test two new letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""FUNNY"": F, U, N, N, Y -> no forbidden letters? Yes.\n\nBut we are using N twice. We know one N is present, but if we use two, we might get feedback that the second N is not present? But that would be inconsistent because we know there is at least one N. Actually, if the word has only one N, then one of the N\'s in ""FUNNY"" would be marked as absent? But we don\'t know. It\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""FUNKY"" which has only one N.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: \n- For ""SNOWY"": tests S, N (in 2nd), O, W, Y.\n- For ""FUNKY"": tests F, U, N (in 3rd), K, Y.\n- For ""BLOWN"": tests B, L, O, W, N (in 5th).\n\nWe also have to consider that we are testing the position of N. We know N is in the word and not in 1 or 4, so by putting it in 2,3, or 5, we are testing one of those.\n\nWe want to maximize the information. Since we have many letters to test, we might want to test a vowel? We haven\'t tested O or U or I (but I is forbidden). We have tested A and E and they are forbidden.\n\nSo the remaining vowels are O and U.\n\n""SNOWY"" has O, which is a common vowel.\n""FUNKY"" has U and Y (which can be a vowel).\n""BLOWN"" has O and W (and B, L).\n\nI think ""SNOWY"" is a good choice because it tests O and also S, W, Y.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""SNOWY"" uses S, N, O, W, Y -> all allowed.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about the position of N? We are putting it in the 2nd position. We know that if the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓, otherwise if it\'s in the 3rd we get a \'-\' and we know it\'s not in 2nd, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in a position that we haven\'t tested and also tests more vowels? But we have only O and U as common vowels left.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OWNING"" -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, 5: O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and also two N\'s? And it\'s 5 letters? O, W, N, I, N -> but I is forbidden and we cannot use it.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have the N in the 5th. We are testing the 2nd position with ""SNOWY"".\n\nIf we get feedback that N is not in the 2nd, then we know it must be in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nSo, I choose ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""BLOWN""? It tests the 5th position and uses B, L, O, W. We haven\'t tested B, L, O, W.\n\nSimilarly, ""FUNKY"" tests F, U, K, Y.\n\nWe want to test the most common letters. Among the available letters, the most common are: O, L, S, D, M, P, B, U, W, Y.\n\nSo ""SNOWY"" tests S, O, W, Y -> which are common.\n\nAlso, note that we haven\'t tested O, which is a common vowel.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SNOWY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in the 2nd position. If the secret word has N in the 2nd, we get a ✓ for N. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know N is in the 3rd or 5th.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SNOWY"".\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in the 4th position. C, R, A, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in the 1st position. I, G, H, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1 or 4** (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5).\n2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T (cannot be used).\n3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like S, O, L, W, Y, U, M, P, B, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test N in a new position**: Since N can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, I\'ll prioritize testing it in position 2 (using ""SNOWY"").\n- **Maximize new information**: Use common untested letters (S, O, W, Y) to cover frequent consonants and vowels.\n- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters (A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T) are used.\n\nThe word **""SNOWY""** fits perfectly:\n- Places N in position 2 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: S, O, W, Y.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>snowy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""snowy"":\n S: x (not in the word)\n N: - (in the word but not in the 2nd position) -> so N is in the word but not in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position? Actually, we know from guess1 that N is not in 4th, from guess2 that not in 1st, and now from guess3 that not in 2nd. Therefore, the only possibility is that N is in the 3rd position? Because the positions are 1,2,3,4,5 and we have ruled out 1,2,4 and now 2? Actually, we have ruled out 1 (from guess2), 2 (from guess3), and 4 (from guess1). So the 3rd position is the only one left? But wait, we also have 5th? We haven\'t tested the 5th.\n\n However, we know that N must be in the word and is not in any of the positions we\'ve tried and gotten wrong. So the 3rd position is a candidate. But we haven\'t tested the 5th? We can test the 5th in the next guess.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have N in the 5th. We haven\'t tested the 5th position for N.\n\n Actually, we have tested:\n - 1st: guess2 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 1st\n - 2nd: guess3 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 2nd\n - 4th: guess1 -> N was - (wrong position) -> so not 4th\n\n And we haven\'t tested 3rd and 5th.\n\n But in guess3, we put N in the 2nd and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 2nd. So we know N is not in 2nd. Similarly, we know it\'s not in 1st, 4th. So the only position left is 3rd? But wait, what about 5th? We haven\'t tested 5th.\n\n Actually, we can test the 5th in the next guess.\n\n But note: we have to form a valid word.\n\n So, we know:\n - The secret word has the letter N.\n - N is not in position 1, 2, 4 (from the feedback of guess1, guess2, guess3 respectively) -> so the only possibility is position 3 or 5.\n\n We have two candidates: 3rd and 5th.\n\n We can try to test both? But we can only test one at a time.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use 5 letters.\n\n How about ""BLOWN"": \n   B, L, O, W, N -> but we put N in the 5th? \n   In ""BLOWN"": B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> so we are testing the 5th position for N.\n\n But we also want to test the 3rd? We can do that in a later guess.\n\n However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? \n Forbidden: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So B, L, O, W, N are allowed.\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know it\'s in the 5th. If we get a \'-\', then we know N is in the 3rd (because that\'s the only other possibility). And if we get an \'x\'? But we know N is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we expect either ✓ or \'-\'.\n\n But we are also testing B, L, O, W in the 1st,2nd,3rd,4th positions.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""BLOWN"". \n\n However, we have to be cautious: what if the word has two N\'s? We don\'t know. But we are only required to have at least one N.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we can\'t because we have to put N in one position.\n\n How about ""FUNNY""? \n   F, U, N, N, Y -> but we are putting N in the 3rd and 4th? But we know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid because it has N in the 4th? Actually, ""FUNNY"" has N in the 3rd and 4th? \n   F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5). \n   But we know that N is not in the 4th (from guess1), so we cannot use the 4th position for N. Therefore, ""FUNNY"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNNY""? Same issue: B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N.\n\n So we avoid.\n\n How about ""BLOWN"": \n   B1, L2, O3, W4, N5 -> N is in the 5th and only the 3rd is left? But we are testing the 5th.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd and also tests the 5th? But we have to use one N.\n\n How about ""MOUND"": \n   M, O, U, N, D -> but N is in the 4th? \n   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.\n\n How about ""BOUND"": \n   B, O, U, N, D -> N in the 4th? Same issue.\n\n How about ""FOUND"": same.\n\n How about ""POUND"": same.\n\n We need a word that has N in the 3rd? Or in the 5th.\n\n Let me think of words with N in the 3rd: \n   _ _ N _ _\n   Example: ""BLAND"" -> but A is forbidden. \n   ""PLANK"" -> A forbidden.\n   ""CLANK"" -> C forbidden.\n\n How about ""STUNK"": \n   S, T, U, N, K -> but S and T are forbidden? T is forbidden (from guess2) and S is forbidden (from guess3). So no.\n\n How about ""JUMPS"": no N.\n\n How about ""DUNNO"": \n   D, U, N, N, O -> N in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid for N? So we cannot use the 4th.\n\n How about ""DUNNY"": \n   D, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, 4th is invalid.\n\n We must avoid the 4th for N.\n\n So, how about ""BUNNY""? \n   B, U, N, N, Y -> N in 3rd and 4th? Again, same issue.\n\n How about ""MINTY"": \n   M, I, N, T, Y -> but I and T are forbidden. No.\n\n How about ""PUNCH"": \n   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H are forbidden. No.\n\n How about ""LUNGY"": \n   L, U, N, G, Y -> G is forbidden (from guess2). No.\n\n How about ""XENON"": \n   X, E, N, O, N -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n How about ""BLOWN"" we already have: B, L, O, W, N -> N in the 5th. And the letters B, L, O, W, N -> no forbidden letters? \n   B: allowed, L: allowed, O: allowed, W: allowed, N: known present.\n\n So ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a \'-\', then we know N must be in the 3rd (because that\'s the only other possibility). And we get information about B, L, O, W.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are having trouble finding one without forbidden letters.\n\n How about ""BLOND"": \n   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? \n   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> but we know N is not in the 4th. So invalid.\n\n How about ""BLOND"" is invalid. What about ""BLAND""? A forbidden.\n\n How about ""PLUMB"": \n   P, L, U, M, B -> no N? We must include N.\n\n How about ""UNCLIP"": too long.\n\n We need a word that has N in the 3rd: \n   _ _ N _ _\n   How about ""BORNS""? Not a word. \n   ""BORNE"" -> E forbidden.\n   ""HORNS"": H and R forbidden? H is forbidden (from guess2) and R is forbidden (from guess1). \n\n How about ""WOMAN"": \n   W, O, M, A, N -> A forbidden.\n\n How about ""YOGIN"": \n   Y, O, G, I, N -> G and I forbidden.\n\n How about ""DOZEN"": \n   D, O, Z, E, N -> E forbidden.\n\n How about ""KOINE"": \n   K, O, I, N, E -> I and E forbidden.\n\n I\'m struggling. Maybe we should focus on the 5th position for now.\n\n Another word: ""BLOWN"" is one option. But we can also try ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of.\n\n Alternatively, ""BOWLN""? Not a word.\n\n Or ""BOWNS""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""BUNNY""? \n   B, U, N, N, Y -> but N is in the 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid. So we cannot use.\n\n How about ""MUNGE"": \n   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""MOUND"": \n   M, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? \n   M(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BOUND"": same.\n\n How about ""FOUND"": same.\n\n How about ""POUND"": same.\n\n How about ""WOUND"": \n   W, O, U, N, D -> N is in the 4th? \n   W(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.\n\n How about ""HOUND"": same.\n\n How about ""MOUND"": same.\n\n How about ""BLAND"": \n   B, L, A, N, D -> A forbidden.\n\n How about ""BLOND"": \n   B, L, O, N, D -> N is in the 4th? \n   B(1), L(2), O(3), N(4), D(5) -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CLINK"": \n   C, L, I, N, K -> C and I forbidden.\n\n How about ""FLING"": \n   F, L, I, N, G -> I and G forbidden.\n\n How about ""SLING"": \n   S, L, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.\n\n How about ""STING"": \n   S, T, I, N, G -> S, T, I, G forbidden.\n\n How about ""SWING"": \n   S, W, I, N, G -> S, I, G forbidden.\n\n How about ""BLUNT"": \n   B, L, U, N, T -> T forbidden.\n\n How about ""FLUNG"": \n   F, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.\n\n How about ""CLUNG"": \n   C, L, U, N, G -> C and G forbidden.\n\n How about ""PLUNG"": \n   P, L, U, N, G -> G forbidden.\n\n How about ""DUNNO"": \n   D, U, N, N, O -> N in 3rd and 4th? We know the 4th is invalid.\n\n How about ""BLOWN"" is the only one I can think of that has N in the 5th and no forbidden letters? \n   B, L, O, W, N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4, N5.\n\n This uses B, L, O, W, N. All are allowed (not in the forbidden list).\n\n So I\'ll go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 5th. If we get a ✓, then we know N is in the 5th. If we get a \'-\', then we know N must be in the 3rd.\n\n Also, we test B, L, O, W.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".\n\n However, we must consider that the word might have the N in the 3rd. If we guess ""BLOWN"" and N is in the 5th, we might get a \'-\' for N and then we know it\'s in the 3rd. But we also get information about the other letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in the 3rd? But we are struggling to find one. Let me try again.\n\n How about ""UNCLIP""? Not 5 letters.\n\n How about ""UNCLO"": \n   U, N, C, L, O -> C forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNDID"": \n   U, N, D, I, D -> I forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNFIT"": \n   U, N, F, I, T -> I and T forbidden.\n\n How about ""UNPIN"": \n   U, N, P, I, N -> I forbidden and two N\'s? Also, N in 2nd and 5th? We know 2nd is not allowed? Actually, we haven\'t tested the 3rd for N? We tested 2nd in guess3 and got \'-\', so 2nd is not allowed. But we haven\'t tested 3rd.\n\n However, we are trying to test the 5th for N? But we can also test the 3rd.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""BUNNY"" but we cannot because of the forbidden letters and the double N.\n\n Another idea: ""MUNCH"" -> M, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.\n\n How about ""LUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""PUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""HUNCH"": same.\n\n How about ""WENCH"": same.\n\n How about ""DUNCE"": \n   D, U, N, C, E -> C and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""DUNGE"": \n   D, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""FUNKY"": \n   F, U, N, K, Y -> N is in the 3rd? \n   F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5). \n   But we haven\'t tested the 3rd for N? And we avoid the forbidden letters? \n   F, U, N, K, Y -> no A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T. So it\'s valid.\n\n But note: we are testing N in the 3rd. If we get a ✓ for N, then we know N is in the 3rd. If we get a \'-\', then we know N must be in the 5th (because that\'s the only other possibility). And we test F, U, K, Y.\n\n So ""FUNKY"" is an alternative.\n\n Now, we have two options: \n   Option 1: ""BLOWN"" (tests 5th position for N and tests B, L, O, W)\n   Option 2: ""FUNKY"" (tests 3rd position for N and tests F, U, K, Y)\n\n Which one to choose? We want to test the position of N and also test new letters.\n\n We know that N must be in either the 3rd or the 5th. So by testing one of them, we can resolve the position.\n\n We can choose either. Let\'s choose ""FUNKY"" because it tests the 3rd position and we get to test F, U, K, Y.\n\n But note: we are also testing the 3rd position for N. If we get a ✓, then we know. If we get a \'-\', then we know N is in the 5th.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests both positions? But we can\'t because we have to put N in one position.\n\n We can choose ""BLOWN"" to test the 5th and also test B, L, O, W.\n\n But we have to decide.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in the 5th and also tests common letters? ""BLOWN"" uses B, L, O, W, N -> which are all common.\n\n ""FUNKY"" uses F, U, K, Y -> which are less common? \n\n But we have to consider that we have two possibilities for N: 3rd or 5th. We can choose one.\n\n I think ""BLOWN"" is a good choice because it tests the 5th position and we get to test B, L, O, W.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has N in the 3rd? Then by guessing ""BLOWN"", we are putting N in the 5th and we get a \'-\' meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. Then we know that N must be in the 3rd. And we get feedback on B, L, O, W.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""FUNKY"" and N is in the 3rd, we get a ✓ for N and we know, and we get feedback on F, U, K, Y.\n\n Both are valid. I\'ll choose ""BLOWN"" because it tests the 5th and we avoid using U and Y which are less common? But U and Y are common.\n\n Actually, we are testing O and L which are common.\n\n So let\'s go with ""BLOWN"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BLOWN"" is a valid word.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""BLOWN"".\n\n<guess>blown</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""night"")**: N is in the word but not in position 1. I, G, H, T are absent.\n- **Guess 3 (""snowy"")**: N is in the word but not in position 2. S, O, W, Y are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **N is confirmed** in the secret word, but **not in positions 1, 2, or 4**. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.\n2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, Y (cannot be used).\n3. **Available letters**: Focus on common unused letters like B, L, U, M, P, F, K, V, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test N in position 5**: Since position 3 is the only other candidate for N, I\'ll test it in position 5 (using ""BLOWN"").\n- **Test new common letters**: Use B, L, O, W (which are common and untested) to maximize information.\n- **Avoid absent letters**: Ensure no forbidden letters are used.\n\nThe word **""BLOWN""** fits:\n- Places N in position 5 (testing the only remaining possibility).\n- Uses new common letters: B, L, O, W.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>blown</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: blown -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""blown"":\n B: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is B!\n L: x (not in the word)\n O: x (not in the word)\n W: x (not in the word)\n N: - (in the word but not in the 5th position) -> so N is in the word but not in the 5th. Since we already know N is in the word and not in 1,2,4 (from previous feedback), the only remaining position for N is 3rd.\n\n Therefore, we now know:\n - The secret word starts with B (position 1 is B).\n - The secret word has N in the 3rd position.\n - The secret word does not contain: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, and now also absent: O, W, L.\n\n So the full list of absent letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.\n\n And we know the word is of the form: B _ N _ _\n\n We need to fill the 2nd, 4th, and 5th positions with letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n Available letters: We have to avoid: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L.\n\n So available letters: B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (but note B is already used at the start, but it can appear again? We don\'t know. The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters, so we cannot rule out duplicates. But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far. We should avoid using B again? Because we already know the first letter is B and we haven\'t tested B in other positions? Actually, we don\'t know if B appears again. But to be safe, we can avoid using B in positions we haven\'t tested? Actually, we have tested B only in the first position and it was correct. We don\'t know if B appears again. But we can use B again? However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use it.\n\n But note: we have to form a valid word.\n\n The word pattern: B _ N _ _\n\n We need to choose a word that fits: B _ N _ _\n\n And uses only available letters (and we can use B again? but we don\'t know).\n\n However, we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\n Let\'s list the available letters: \n   B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z\n\n But note: we already used B in the first position. If we use B again, we are testing if there is a second B? But we don\'t have any information about duplicates. So we can try.\n\n But to maximize information, we might avoid using B again and test new letters.\n\n So, we need to fill positions 2,4,5 with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (and we can avoid B for now? but we don\'t have to).\n\n However, we know that the word has N in the 3rd, so the pattern is: B _ N _ _\n\n We can try a word that has, say, U in the 2nd and then M in the 4th and Y in the 5th: ""BUNNY"" -> but we have two N\'s? And we know N is in the 3rd. Also, ""BUNNY"" has N in the 2nd and 5th? But we are putting N in the 3rd? Actually, in ""BUNNY"": \n   B(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5) -> but we are putting N in the 3rd (which is correct) and also in the 4th? We know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""BUNNY"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"": \n   B, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.\n\n How about ""BANDY"": \n   B, A, N, D, Y -> A forbidden.\n\n How about ""BONEY"": \n   B, O, N, E, Y -> O and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""BONNY"": \n   B, O, N, N, Y -> O forbidden and N in the 4th?

We know the 4th is invalid.\n\n How about ""DUNNO"": \n   D, U, N, N, O -> O forbidden and N in the 3rd and 4th? Also, we know the 4th is invalid.\n\n How about ""MUNGE"": \n   M, U, N, G, E -> G and E forbidden.\n\n How about ""PUNCH"": \n   P, U, N, C, H -> C and H forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"": same.\n\n We are having trouble. \n\n How about we try a word that doesn\'t have N in the 4th? We know N is in the 3rd, so we can only use N in the 3rd? And we cannot put it in the 4th or 5th? Actually, we can put it in the 5th? But we know from the feedback of ""blown"" that N is not in the 5th? \n   In ""blown"": we had N in the 5th and got a \'-\', meaning N is in the word but not in the 5th. So we know N is not in the 5th. Therefore, the only position left for N is the 3rd.\n\n So we must have N in the 3rd.\n\n Therefore, the pattern is: B _ N _ _\n\n We need to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions with letters from: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word: \n   Position 1: B (fixed)\n   Position 2: ? (must be from D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z)\n   Position 3: N (fixed)\n   Position 4: ?\n   Position 5: ?\n\n Example: ""BUNNY"" is invalid because of the 4th N and the 5th Y. But we know the 4th cannot be N.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.\n\n How about ""BONKY"": \n   B, O, N, K, Y -> O forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNKS"": \n   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNKY"": \n   B, U, N, K, Y -> \n        B1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? \n        U, K, Y are available? \n        But we haven\'t tested U, K, Y.\n\n This word: ""BUNKY"" -> is it valid? It means cozy or comfortable. Yes, it\'s a word.\n\n But note: we are putting U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""BUNKY"".\n\n But we have to check: \n   Position 2: U -> we haven\'t tested U.\n   Position 4: K -> we haven\'t tested K.\n   Position 5: Y -> we haven\'t tested Y.\n\n And we avoid all forbidden letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""BUNKY"" is a valid word.\n\n Another option: ""BUNNY"" is invalid. \n\n How about ""MUNGE""? Forbidden letters.\n\n How about ""PUNKY"": \n   P, U, N, K, Y -> \n        P1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters.\n\n ""PUNKY"" is a word (meaning sassy or rebellious).\n\n But we have to choose between ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are anagrams? \n   BUNKY: B, U, N, K, Y -> same letters as PUNKY? \n   PUNKY: P, U, N, K, Y -> same.\n\n So either is fine. We can choose one.\n\n But note: we have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We are testing U in the 2nd, K in the 4th, Y in the 5th for both.\n\n We don\'t have any information about U, K, Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters? The most common available letters are: U, D, F, M, P, K, Y.\n\n ""BUNKY"" uses U, K, Y.\n ""PUNKY"" uses P, U, K, Y.\n\n We haven\'t tested U, K, Y at all.\n\n Another word: ""BUNKS"" -> S forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"" -> C and H forbidden.\n\n How about ""BANDY"" -> A forbidden.\n\n How about ""BONKY"" -> O forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.\n\n How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the best options.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far. But we can try.\n\n However, we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". They are both valid.\n\n But we don\'t have any information about the 2nd,4th,5th positions. We have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses D or F? \n\n How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common words.\n\n Another one: ""BUNNY"" is invalid.\n\n How about ""MUMMY"": \n   M, U, M, M, Y -> but we have three M\'s? And we don\'t know if M is in the word. But we haven\'t tested M. \n   However, we are putting N in the 3rd? ""MUMMY"" has no N? We must include N.\n\n How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the main options.\n\n Let me choose ""BUNKY"".\n\n But note: we are putting U in the 2nd. We haven\'t tested U. Similarly, K in the 4th and Y in the 5th.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"" to test P instead of B? But we already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don\'t know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don\'t have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.\n\n So both are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""BUNKY"".\n\n But wait: what if the word is ""PUNKY""? We don\'t know. We have to guess one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has different letters? But we are constrained by the pattern B _ N _ _ and the available letters.\n\n Another word: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only common ones.\n\n How about ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNKS"": \n   B, U, N, K, S -> S forbidden.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""FUNKY"": \n   F, U, N, K, Y -> \n        F1, U2, N3, K4, Y5 -> no forbidden letters? \n        But we have to avoid using F? We haven\'t tested F. And we are testing U, K, Y.\n\n But note: we are testing F in the first position? We already know the first letter is B? Actually, we don\'t know for sure. We have B as correct in the first position. But we are using B in the first position again. We don\'t have information about the second position. We are testing U in the second.\n\n So ""FUNKY"" is a valid word and tests F, U, K, Y.\n\n But we already have B as the first letter. So if we use ""FUNKY"", we are:\n   F (new) in position 1 -> but we know position 1 is B? Actually, we don\'t know for sure. We have B as correct in position 1, but what if the word has B in the first and also elsewhere? We don\'t know. But we are using B in the first position. However, we are testing F in the first. If the word has F, then we get information.\n\n But we are also testing U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PUNKY"": P in the first, U in the second, N in the third, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.\n\n We have two options: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". \n\n Let me choose ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter? Or ""BUNKY"" because B is already known? But we are using B again? We don\'t know if B appears again. But we can test.\n\n However, we are more interested in getting the word right than in testing new letters? We have to test the 2nd,4th,5th positions.\n\n But note: we have to use the pattern B _ N _ _.\n\n We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.\n\n But we already have B in the first, so we are effectively testing P in the first? But we don\'t know if the first letter is P or B? We know it\'s B, so if we put B in the first, we get a ✓, and we test the other positions.\n\n Alternatively, if we put P in the first and it\'s correct, then we know the first letter is P. But we know the first letter is B? Actually, we don\'t know for sure. We have B as correct in the first, but what if the word has B in the first and also another B? We don\'t know.\n\n But we are trying to guess the word. We have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". \n\n We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.\n\n Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.\n\n I think ""PUNKY"" is a word and we haven\'t tested P, U, K, Y.\n\n So let\'s choose ""PUNKY"".\n\n But note: we are putting N in the 3rd, which we know is correct. We are testing P in the first, U in the second, K in the fourth, Y in the fifth.\n\n If we get:\n   P: if correct, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it\'s B (and we already know B is in the first, so it must be B). But wait, if we put P in the first and it\'s not correct, then we know the first letter must be B? Because we have B as correct in the first? Actually, we have B as correct in the first, so if the word is ""BUNKY"", then P would be absent? But we are testing P in the first. If P is absent, then we know the first letter is B (because we have B as correct in the first) and then the word is ""BUNKY"" (if we get U correct and K and Y also). But we are testing U in the second.\n\n Alternatively, if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the feedback is:\n   P: if ✓ then first letter is P, and we test U, K, Y.\n   If P is absent, then the first letter must be B, and we get a ✓ for B (again) and then we test U, K, Y for the second, fourth, fifth positions.\n\n But we already know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it\'s absent, we don\'t learn anything new about the first position? Actually, we know the first letter is B, so if we put P in the first and it\'s absent, then we know the first letter is B and the word is ""BUNKY"" (if U is correct, etc.).\n\n However, we have two candidates: ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"". \n\n We can also consider ""BUNNY"" but it has N in the 4th? We know N is not in the 4th.\n\n Another word: ""BUNCH"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BANDY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BONKY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNNY"" -> invalid.\n\n How about ""BUNKY"" and ""PUNKY"" are the only two.\n\n I think we should choose one. Let\'s choose ""PUNKY"" because it tests P, which is a common letter.\n\n But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it\'s B and the word is ""BUNKY"".\n\n So we can guess ""PUNKY"". If it\'s not correct, then we know it\'s ""BUNKY"".\n\n But we have to make sure we have enough guesses. We have 4 left? Actually, we have 4 guesses left? We used 4 guesses? Let me count:\n   Guess 1: crane\n   Guess 2: night\n   Guess 3: snowy\n   Guess 4: blown\n\n So we have 2 more guesses? Actually, the game gives 6 tries, so we have 2 left.\n\n We can guess ""PUNKY"" and if it\'s not correct, then we guess ""BUNKY"" next.\n\n But we can also try to test more letters? We have to fill the 2nd,4th,5th positions.\n\n We know the pattern: B _ N _ _\n\n We can try ""PUNKY"" to test P, U, K, Y.\n\n But we can also try a word that uses different letters? For example, we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.\n\n But we don\'t have many options.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses different letters? But we are constrained.\n\n Another idea: we can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.\n\n But we don\'t know which one.\n\n I think we should guess ""PUNKY"" because P is a common letter.\n\n But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it\'s B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".\n\n So let\'s guess ""PUNKY"".\n\n But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get it in the next guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? But we have to use the pattern.\n\n We can try ""BUNKY"" to test U, K, Y.\n\n But we have to choose one.\n\n I\'ll go with ""PUNKY"" because P is more common than U? Actually, in English, P is more common than U? \n\n But let\'s see the frequency: \n   P: very common\n   U: common\n   K: common\n   Y: common\n\n So ""PUNKY"" tests P, U, K, Y.\n\n But note: we are testing the first position with P. If we get a ✓, then we know the first letter is P. If not, then we know it\'s B and we can guess ""BUNKY"".\n\n So, I choose ""PUNKY"".\n\n But wait: what if the word is ""BUNKY""? Then we get:\n   P: absent (x) because the first letter is B, not P.\n   U: ? \n   N: ✓ (we know it\'s in the 3rd)\n   K: ?\n   Y: ?\n\n Then we would know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it.\n\n But if we guess ""PUNKY"" and the word is ""BUNKY"", then we get:\n   P: x (absent)\n   U: ? \n   N: ✓\n   K: ? \n   Y: ?\n\n Then we know the word is ""BUNKY"" and we can guess it in the next turn.\n\n So it\'s safe.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""PUNKY"".\n\n<guess>punky</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word but not in position 4.

S, O, W, Y are absent.\n- **Guess 4 (""blown"")**: \n  - B is **correct** in position 1 (✓).\n  - L, O, W, N are absent (x).  \n  - This means:  \n    - N is not in position 5 (since we got ""-"" for N in position 5).  \n    - L, O, W are new absent letters.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Confirmed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **B** (from Guess 4).  \n   - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4 feedback: N is in the word but not in position 5, and we already knew it wasn\'t in positions 1–4).  \n2. **Absent letters**: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L (12 letters eliminated).  \n3. **Word pattern**: The secret word is **B _ N _ _**.  \n4. **Remaining possibilities**:  \n   - N must be in position 3 (only remaining slot).  \n   - Valid letters for other positions: D, F, K, M, P, U, V, X, Y, Z (since A–L are eliminated).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Focus on position 2, 4, and 5**: Use new, common letters from the available set to test the unknown positions.  \n- **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: U, K, Y, M, P, D (most common untested letters).  \n- **Candidate words**:  \n  - **""PUNKY""**: Tests P (position 1), U (position 2), K (position 4), Y (position 5).  \n  - **""BUNKY""**: Tests B (position 1) again and U, K, Y.  \n- **Why ""PUNKY""?**  \n  - Tests P in position 1 (if correct, we lock position 1; if absent, position 1 must be B, and we can guess ""BUNKY"" next).  \n  - Covers high-frequency letters: P, U, K, Y.  \n  - Avoids reusing absent letters.  \n\n### Next Guess: **""PUNKY""**\n- Tests the pattern **B _ N _ _** with N fixed in position 3.  \n- Maximizes new information:  \n  - If P is ✓, we lock position 1.  \n  - If U is ✓, we lock position 2.  \n  - If K is ✓, we lock position 4.  \n  - If Y is ✓, we lock position 5.  \n- Failsafe: If all other positions are absent, the word must be **""BUNKY""** (since N is fixed in position 3).\n\n<guess>punky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: night -> FEEDBACK: N(-) I(x) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: snowy -> FEEDBACK: S(x) N(-) O(x) W(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: blown -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x) N(-)\nGuess 5: punky -> FEEDBACK: P(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""punky"":
 P: x (not in the word)
 U: ✓ (correct position) -> so the second letter is U!
 N: ✓ (correct position) -> so the third letter is N! We already knew N was in the word and must be in position 3 (from the previous feedback). Now we know it's actually in position 3.
 K: x (not in the word)
 Y: x (not in the word)

 So, combining with previous feedback:
 - The secret word is: B U N _ _
 - We know the first letter is B, second is U, third is N.
 - Absent letters: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, P, K, Y.

 We have used 5 guesses and have 1 left.

 Now, we need to fill the 4th and 5th positions.

 The word pattern: B U N _ _

 Available letters for the 4th and 5th positions: 
   We have to avoid: A, C, E, G, H, I, R, T, S, O, W, L, P, K, Y.

 So available letters: D, F, M, V, X, Z (and we can use B? But we already have B in the first position, and we don't know if B appears again. But we can use B? However, we are trying to find the word, so we can use B again? But we don't have any information about duplicates.

 But note: we have already tested B in the first position and it was correct. We haven't tested B in other positions. So we can try.

 However, we are only missing two letters. We can try a word that uses two new letters from the available set.

 The pattern: B U N _ _

 We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses two letters from: D, F, M, V, X, Z.

 Let's think of words: 
   BUN...? 

 Common words: 
   BUNCH -> but C and H are absent? C and H are in the forbidden list.
   BUNNY -> but N is in the 4th? We know the 4th is not allowed for N? Actually, we know the 4th is not allowed for N? From guess1, we know N is not in 4th. So we cannot put N in the 4th. Therefore, ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

   BUNCH -> invalid because of C and H.

   BUNCH is invalid.

   How about ""BUNDS"": 
        B, U, N, D, S -> but S is forbidden.

   ""BUNDS"" has S, which is forbidden.

   ""BUNDY"": 
        B, U, N, D, Y -> but Y is forbidden? From guess3, Y is absent? So we cannot use Y.

   ""BUNNY"" is invalid.

   ""BUNCH"" is invalid.

   How about ""BUNCO"": 
        B, U, N, C, O -> C and O are forbidden.

   ""BUNNY"" is the same.

   How about ""BUNKY"": 
        B, U, N, K, Y -> but K and Y are forbidden? From guess4, K and Y are absent? So we cannot use.
