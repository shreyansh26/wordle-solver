We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E). Some possibilities:

 Option 1: ""SPLIT"" - contains S, P, L, I, T. All these are new and not forbidden.
 Option 2: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H. Also new letters.
 Option 3: ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y. But note that Y can be a vowel.

 However, we want to maximize the information. Let's choose a word that has common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S. All new.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. Since we haven't tried O, U, I, etc., let's include one or two of them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This covers three vowels (I, O, U) and two common consonants (P, S).

 However, let's check if there's a word that covers more common letters. The word ""SLIPT"" is not common, but ""SPILT"" is a variant of split.

 Another common word: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L. But O and U are vowels.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words, after avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 We can try to form a word with S, T, L, O, and P. But note that we have 5 letters to choose.

 The word ""SLOP"" is not 5 letters. We need 5 letters. How about ""SLOPS""? But that has an S at the end and might be considered plural? Alternatively, ""SLOPE"" has E which is forbidden.

 Since E is forbidden, we cannot use words ending with E. Similarly, we cannot use words with E.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N,E. Some options:

 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all allowed.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> allowed.
 - ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> allowed.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> allowed.

 But note: we want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels. Since we have only tried A and E (which are out) and we haven't tested O, I, U, we should test one or two of them.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"". It has O and I, which are vowels we haven't tested.

 So, our next guess: ""MOIST""

 We'll use ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. 

I'll prioritize testing new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (S, T, M, P, L) to maximize information. A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:
- Uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all untested.
- Covers three vowels (O, I) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new letters in key positions.

It has O and I, which are vowels we haven\'t tested.\n\n So, our next guess: ""MOIST""\n\n We\'ll use ""moist"".\n\n<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. \n\nI\'ll prioritize testing new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (S, T, M, P, L) to maximize information. A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:\n- Uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all untested.\n- Covers three vowels (O, I) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new letters in key positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So these letters are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 2, since ""moist"" is M-O-I-S-T, so O is the second letter)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from ""moist"":
- The second letter is O (because O is correct and in position).
- The fifth letter is T (because T is correct and in position).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ O _ _ T
- The letters M, I, S are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we need to avoid using the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also know the word must be of the form: _ O _ _ T

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not forbidden.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. So the remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and T are already known to be in the word, but we are going to use them again? Actually, in the pattern, we know the second letter is O and fifth is T, so we must use O in the second position and T in the fifth. For the other positions, we need to use letters from the available set.

However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- BOLT: B O L T? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

Let me think of 5-letter words ending with T and having O as the second letter.

Examples:
- BOUT: but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter words.

Actually, the pattern is: [1]O[3][4]T

So:
- Position 1: any letter except forbidden (so B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 3: same set
- Position 4: same set

Common words:
- ""DOUT"": not 5 letters.
- ""GOUT"": not 5 letters.

Actually, let's think:
- ""BOUT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

How about:
- ""BOULT"": but that's a word? It means a volume of water or something, but it's not very common. Also, it has U and L. But let's check: B O U L T? That would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. But we have T at the end, which is correct. However, we have to avoid forbidden letters. B, U, L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the forbidden list.

But is ""BOULT"" a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. However, we can also think of more common words.

Another one: ""POUTY"" - but that ends with Y, not T. We need T at the end.

Words ending with T and second letter O:
- ""BOOTH"": B O O T H? But that has two O's? And the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be H? Actually, ""BOOTH"" is B-O-O-T-H, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H? But we need the fifth letter to be T, but here it's H. So no.

We need the fifth letter to be T, so the word must end with T.

Another word: ""DOUBT"": D O U B T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:B, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And D, U, B are not forbidden.

But is ""DOUBT"" a valid word? Yes.

Another possibility: ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> but R is forbidden (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.

Similarly, ""TROUT"": T R O U T -> R is forbidden.

""BLOUT"": not a common word.

""POUT"": not 5 letters.

""JOUST"": J O U S T -> but S is forbidden (from second guess: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

""COULT"": C is forbidden.

""FOULT"": F O U L T -> F, U, L are allowed. Is ""FOULT"" a word? It might be a variant of ""fault"", but typically ""fault"" is 5 letters without the F? Actually, ""FOULT"" is not a standard word. Let me check: perhaps ""FAULT"" is the common one, but that has A (forbidden) and U, L, T. But A is forbidden.

We need to avoid A, so ""FAULT"" is out.

Another word: ""MOUTH"": but M is forbidden (from second guess: M is absent) and we have O in the second position? M O U T H -> but the fifth letter is H, not T. And we need T at the end.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Let me list words ending with T and second letter O:
- DOUBT: D O U B T
- GROUT: but R is forbidden and also T is at the end, but the fourth letter is U? G R O U T -> forbidden R.
- TOWIT: not a common word, and T is at position 1? T O W I T -> but I is forbidden and also T is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. However, I is forbidden.

Another one: ""BOWLT"" - not a word.

""POWLT"" - not a word.

""VOLT"": not 5 letters.

""WOLT"": not 5 letters.

""YOLT"": not a word.

""BOULT"": as I thought earlier. It is a word (meaning a volume of water or a fold of skin). But let's see: B O U L T -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if B, U, L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the forbidden list.

Another word: ""DOULT"" - not a word.

""JOULT"" - not a word.

""COULT"" - C is forbidden.

""FOULT"" - not a standard word.

""LOUTH"" - not common.

""TOUCH"" - but that ends with H, not T.

We have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Are there others?

""POUTY"" is not ending with T.

""ROUT"" is 4 letters.

""GROUP"" - but that doesn't end with T.

Another idea: ""BOLT"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters. So:

- ""DOUBT"": D O U B T
- ""BOULT"": B O U L T

But note: in ""BOULT"", the fourth letter is L, and fifth is T. So it fits.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""DOUBT"", we would test D, U, B.
In ""BOULT"", we test B, U, L.

We already know O and T are in the word and in the correct positions, so we don't need to test them again? But we are using them to complete the word.

We also have to avoid the forbidden letters: so D, U, B, L are all available.

But we don't know if U is in the word. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters. For example, we haven't tested L, D, U, B, etc.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2, so we are on the third guess.

We can also consider other words that fit the pattern.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.

""JOUST"" has S and is forbidden.

""TOAST"" has A and S, both forbidden.

""BOAST"" has A and S.

What about ""BOOTH""? But it ends with H, not T.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" - but E is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main candidates.

But let's check if there are others.

""COVET"" - but C is forbidden and it ends with T? C O V E T -> but E is forbidden and the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be the one before T. In ""COVET"", it's C-O-V-E-T, so the fourth letter is E (forbidden) and fifth is T. But E is forbidden, so we cannot use it.

""ROVET"" - not a word and R is forbidden.

""LOVAT"" - not common.

""DOVAT"" - not a word.

""GOAT"" is 4 letters.

So, perhaps ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the only common words? But let's think of ""JOULT"" - not a word.

""TOULT"" - not a word.

""BOULT"" is acceptable? Or ""DOULT"" is not a word. But ""BOULT"" is a word.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.

""JOUST"" is forbidden.

""TOUCH"" ends with H.

We have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Let me check if there is ""FOULT"" - it might be a variant, but typically we use ""FAULT"" which is 5 letters and has A (forbidden).

Perhaps ""BOULT"" is the best? Or ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have not tested U, B, D, L, etc.

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" - but that ends with Y and has G, O, U, T, Y. But the pattern requires the fifth letter to be T, so it must end with T. ""GOUTY"" ends with Y.

Another word: ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

""BOUTY"" - not a word.

So, I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main options.

But let's see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both words use allowed letters.

We can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

What about ""LOUTY""? Not a word.

""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.

I think we have to choose between ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"".

But note: in ""DOUBT"", the fourth letter is B and fifth is T. In ""BOULT"", the fourth is L and fifth is T.

We can also think of ""COVET"" but forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DOWTY"" - not a word.

""ROWTH"" - not a word.

""BOGUS"" - but S is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think we have to go with ""DOUBT"" or ""BOULT"".

But let's see the feedback: we have O and T fixed. We need to test the other positions.

We can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

What about ""JOUST"" - forbidden.

Perhaps ""TOUCH"" is not ending with T.

I found: ""BOULT"" is a word (meaning a fold of skin or a volume of water). It is accepted in some dictionaries.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"" because it is more common.

But note: in ""DOUBT"", we have:
- D: not tested before
- O: already known and in correct position
- U: not tested
- B: not tested
- T: already known and in correct position

So we are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we already have two vowels? O is already known, and U is new.

So, let's choose ""DOUBT"".

But wait, what about the first letter? We can try D.

Another word: ""BOULT"" has B at the first position.

But we don't know which one.

We can also consider ""POUTY"" but it ends with Y, not T.

Or ""JOUST"" is forbidden.

I think ""DOUBT"" is a good choice.

But let's check the forbidden letters: we are using D, O, U, B, T. O and T are known, so we are testing D, U, B.

If we get all x for D, U, B, then we know they are not in the word, and we can try other letters.

But we have to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have O and T in the same positions? But we know they must be there, so we should use them to get more information about the other positions.

But in this case, we are forced to use O in second and T in fifth.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters, valid, and not use forbidden letters.

""DOUBT"" is a valid word.

So, guess: ""DOUBT""

But note: the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so ""DOUBT"" fits: D O U B T.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can make the next guess.

So, the next guess is ""doubt"".

But wait, what if the word is ""BOULT""? Then we would get it wrong, but we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more new letters? For example, we could try a word that has L, but then we have to fit the pattern.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" is fine.

But let me think of ""GOUTY"": G O U T Y -> but that ends with Y, not T. So no.

""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DOUBT"" uses D, O, U, B, T. O and T are allowed because they are known to be in the word. The new letters are D, U, B.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get:
- D: if it's in the word and in the correct position? Or if it's present but wrong position? Or absent.

Similarly for U and B.

This will give us information.

So, the guess is ""doubt"".

But let me write it in uppercase: DOUBT.

However, in the previous guess we used ""moist"" in lowercase, so I'll use lowercase.

So, <guess>doubt</guess>

But wait, what about ""BOULT""? It is a word, but less common. So ""DOUBT"" is better.

Alternatively, we can try ""POUTY"" but it doesn't end with T, so it would be invalid because we know the fifth letter must be T.

So, we must have the fifth letter T.

Therefore, I choose ""doubt"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → O is correct and in position 2 (✓), T is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, I, S are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **O** as the second letter and **T** as the fifth letter, so the pattern is: `_ O _ _ T`.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S**.
- Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, T are already confirmed but must be reused in positions 2 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ O _ _ T` using only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, L, B, P) and the vowel U to maximize information.
- **""doubt""** is a strong choice:
  - Fits the pattern: `D O U B T`.
  - Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **U** (position 3), and **B** (position 4).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and reuses O and T in their known positions to confirm the pattern.

<guess>doubt</guess>",doubt,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So these letters are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 2, since ""moist"" is M-O-I-S-T, so O is the second letter)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from ""moist"":
- The second letter is O (because O is correct and in position).
- The fifth letter is T (because T is correct and in position).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ O _ _ T
- The letters M, I, S are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we need to avoid using the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also know the word must be of the form: _ O _ _ T

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not forbidden.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. So the remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and T are already known to be in the word, but we are going to use them again? Actually, in the pattern, we know the second letter is O and fifth is T, so we must use O in the second position and T in the fifth. For the other positions, we need to use letters from the available set.

However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- BOLT: B O L T? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

Examples:
- BOUT: but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter words.

Actually, the pattern is: [1]O[3][4]T

So:
- Position 1: any letter except forbidden (so B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 3: same set
- Position 4: same set

Common words:
- ""DOUT"": not 5 letters.
- ""GOUT"": not 5 letters.

Actually, let's think:

But we have T at the end, which is correct. However, we have to avoid forbidden letters. B, U, L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the forbidden list.

But is ""BOULT"" a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. However, we can also think of more common words.

Another one: ""POUTY"" - but that ends with Y, not T. We need T at the end.

Words ending with T and second letter O:
- ""BOOTH"": B O O T H? But that has two O's? And the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be H? Actually, ""BOOTH"" is B-O-O-T-H, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H? But we need the fifth letter to be T, but here it's H. So no.

We need the fifth letter to be T, so the word must end with T.

Another word: ""DOUBT"": D O U B T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:B, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And D, U, B are not forbidden.

But is ""DOUBT"" a valid word? Yes.

Another possibility: ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> but R is forbidden (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.

Similarly, ""TROUT"": T R O U T -> R is forbidden.

""BLOUT"": not a common word.

""POUT"": not 5 letters.

""JOUST"": J O U S T -> but S is forbidden (from second guess: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

""COULT"": C is forbidden.

""FOULT"": F O U L T -> F, U, L are allowed. Is ""FOULT"" a word? It might be a variant of ""fault"", but typically ""fault"" is 5 letters without the F? Actually, ""FOULT"" is not a standard word.

- TOWIT: not a common word, and T is at position 1? T O W I T -> but I is forbidden and also T is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. However, I is forbidden.

""VOLT"": not 5 letters.

""WOLT"": not 5 letters.

""YOLT"": not a word.

""JOUST"" has S and is forbidden.

""TOAST"" has A and S, both forbidden.

""BOAST"" has A and S.

What about ""BOOTH""? But it ends with H, not T.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" - but E is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main candidates.

But let's check if there are others.

""COVET"" - but C is forbidden and it ends with T? C O V E T -> but E is forbidden and the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be the one before T. In ""COVET"", it's C-O-V-E-T, so the fourth letter is E (forbidden) and fifth is T. But E is forbidden, so we cannot use it.

""ROVET"" - not a word and R is forbidden.

""LOVAT"" - not common.

""DOVAT"" - not a word.

""GOAT"" is 4 letters.

So, perhaps ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the only common words? But let's think of ""JOULT"" - not a word.

""TOULT"" - not a word.

""BOULT"" is acceptable? Or ""DOULT"" is not a word. But ""BOULT"" is a word.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.

""JOUST"" is forbidden.

""TOUCH"" ends with H.

We have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Let me check if there is ""FOULT"" - it might be a variant, but typically we use ""FAULT"" which is 5 letters and has A (forbidden).

Perhaps ""BOULT"" is the best? Or ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have not tested U, B, D, L, etc.

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" - but that ends with Y and has G, O, U, T, Y. But the pattern requires the fifth letter to be T, so it must end with T. ""GOUTY"" ends with Y.

Another word: ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

""BOGUS"" - but S is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think we have to go with ""DOUBT"" or ""BOULT"".

But let's see the feedback: we have O and T fixed. We need to test the other positions.

We can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

What about ""JOUST"" - forbidden.

Perhaps ""TOUCH"" is not ending with T.

I found: ""BOULT"" is a word (meaning a fold of skin or a volume of water). It is accepted in some dictionaries.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"" because it is more common.

But note: in ""DOUBT"", we have:
- D: not tested before
- O: already known and in correct position
- U: not tested
- B: not tested
- T: already known and in correct position

So we are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we already have two vowels? O is already known, and U is new.

So, let's choose ""DOUBT"".

But wait, what about the first letter? We can try D.

Another word: ""BOULT"" has B at the first position.

But we don't know which one.

We can also consider ""POUTY"" but it ends with Y, not T.

Or ""JOUST"" is forbidden.

I think ""DOUBT"" is a good choice.

But let's check the forbidden letters: we are using D, O, U, B, T. O and T are known, so we are testing D, U, B.

If we get all x for D, U, B, then we know they are not in the word, and we can try other letters.

But we have to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have O and T in the same positions? But we know they must be there, so we should use them to get more information about the other positions.

But in this case, we are forced to use O in second and T in fifth.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters, valid, and not use forbidden letters.

""DOUBT"" is a valid word.

So, guess: ""DOUBT""

But note: the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so ""DOUBT"" fits: D O U B T.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can make the next guess.

So, the next guess is ""doubt"".

But wait, what if the word is ""BOULT""? Then we would get it wrong, but we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more new letters? For example, we could try a word that has L, but then we have to fit the pattern.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" is fine.

But let me think of ""GOUTY"": G O U T Y -> but that ends with Y, not T. So no.

""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DOUBT"" uses D, O, U, B, T. O and T are allowed because they are known to be in the word. The new letters are D, U, B.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get:
- D: if it's in the word and in the correct position? Or if it's present but wrong position? Or absent.

Similarly for U and B.

This will give us information.

So, the guess is ""doubt"".

But let me write it in uppercase: DOUBT.

However, in the previous guess we used ""moist"" in lowercase, so I'll use lowercase.

So, <guess>doubt</guess>

But wait, what about ""BOULT""? It is a word, but less common. So ""DOUBT"" is better.

Alternatively, we can try ""POUTY"" but it doesn't end with T, so it would be invalid because we know the fifth letter must be T.

So, we must have the fifth letter T.

Therefore, I choose ""doubt"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → O is correct and in position 2 (✓), T is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, I, S are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **O** as the second letter and **T** as the fifth letter, so the pattern is: `_ O _ _ T`.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S**.
- Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, T are already confirmed but must be reused in positions 2 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ O _ _ T` using only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, L, B, P) and the vowel U to maximize information.
- **""doubt""** is a strong choice:
  - Fits the pattern: `D O U B T`.
  - Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **U** (position 3), and **B** (position 4).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and reuses O and T in their known positions to confirm the pattern.",Guess 3: doubt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(✓) B(-) T(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E). Some possibilities:

 Option 1: ""SPLIT"" - contains S, P, L, I, T. All these are new and not forbidden.
 Option 2: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H. Also new letters.
 Option 3: ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y. But note that Y can be a vowel.

 However, we want to maximize the information. Let's choose a word that has common letters that we haven't tried.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S. All new.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. Since we haven't tried O, U, I, etc., let's include one or two of them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This covers three vowels (I, O, U) and two common consonants (P, S).

 However, let's check if there's a word that covers more common letters. The word ""SLIPT"" is not common, but ""SPILT"" is a variant of split.

 Another common word: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L. But O and U are vowels.

 Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words, after avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 We can try to form a word with S, T, L, O, and P. But note that we have 5 letters to choose.

 The word ""SLOP"" is not 5 letters. We need 5 letters. How about ""SLOPS""? But that has an S at the end and might be considered plural? Alternatively, ""SLOPE"" has E which is forbidden.

 Since E is forbidden, we cannot use words ending with E. Similarly, we cannot use words with E.

 Let me think of words without C,R,A,N,E. Some options:

 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all allowed.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> allowed.
 - ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> allowed.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> allowed.

 But note: we want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels. Since we have only tried A and E (which are out) and we haven't tested O, I, U, we should test one or two of them.

 Let's choose ""MOIST"". It has O and I, which are vowels we haven't tested.

 So, our next guess: ""MOIST""

 We'll use ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. 

I'll prioritize testing new common vowels (O, I, U) and consonants (S, T, M, P, L) to maximize information. A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:
- Uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all untested.
- Covers three vowels (O, I) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new letters in key positions.

<guess>moist</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So these letters are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 2, since ""moist"" is M-O-I-S-T, so O is the second letter)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: absent (x)
   - T: correct (✓) and in the correct position (position 5)

So, from ""moist"":
- The second letter is O (because O is correct and in position).
- The fifth letter is T (because T is correct and in position).
- M, I, S are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has O as the second letter and T as the fifth letter. So the word pattern is: _ O _ _ T
- The letters M, I, S are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Now, we need to avoid using the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S.

We also know the word must be of the form: _ O _ _ T

We need to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only letters that are not forbidden.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S. So the remaining letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: O and T are already known to be in the word, but we are going to use them again? Actually, in the pattern, we know the second letter is O and fifth is T, so we must use O in the second position and T in the fifth. For the other positions, we need to use letters from the available set.

However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback doesn't indicate that, so we assume no duplicates for now (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We need to form a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] O [letter3] [letter4] T

We can try to think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- BOLT: B O L T? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: so the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

Let me think of 5-letter words ending with T and having O as the second letter.

Examples:
- BOUT: but that's 4 letters? No, 5-letter words.

Actually, the pattern is: [1]O[3][4]T

So:
- Position 1: any letter except forbidden (so B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
- Position 3: same set
- Position 4: same set

Common words:
- ""DOUT"": not 5 letters.
- ""GOUT"": not 5 letters.

Actually, let's think:
- ""BOUT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

How about:
- ""BOULT"": but that's a word? It means a volume of water or something, but it's not very common. Also, it has U and L. But let's check: B O U L T? That would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. But we have T at the end, which is correct. However, we have to avoid forbidden letters. B, U, L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the forbidden list.

But is ""BOULT"" a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. However, we can also think of more common words.

Another one: ""POUTY"" - but that ends with Y, not T. We need T at the end.

Words ending with T and second letter O:
- ""BOOTH"": B O O T H? But that has two O's? And the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be H? Actually, ""BOOTH"" is B-O-O-T-H, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H? But we need the fifth letter to be T, but here it's H. So no.

We need the fifth letter to be T, so the word must end with T.

Another word: ""DOUBT"": D O U B T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:B, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And D, U, B are not forbidden.

But is ""DOUBT"" a valid word? Yes.

Another possibility: ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> but R is forbidden (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.

Similarly, ""TROUT"": T R O U T -> R is forbidden.

""BLOUT"": not a common word.

""POUT"": not 5 letters.

""JOUST"": J O U S T -> but S is forbidden (from second guess: S is absent). So we cannot use S.

""COULT"": C is forbidden.

""FOULT"": F O U L T -> F, U, L are allowed. Is ""FOULT"" a word? It might be a variant of ""fault"", but typically ""fault"" is 5 letters without the F? Actually, ""FOULT"" is not a standard word. Let me check: perhaps ""FAULT"" is the common one, but that has A (forbidden) and U, L, T. But A is forbidden.

We need to avoid A, so ""FAULT"" is out.

Another word: ""MOUTH"": but M is forbidden (from second guess: M is absent) and we have O in the second position? M O U T H -> but the fifth letter is H, not T. And we need T at the end.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Let me list words ending with T and second letter O:
- DOUBT: D O U B T
- GROUT: but R is forbidden and also T is at the end, but the fourth letter is U? G R O U T -> forbidden R.
- TOWIT: not a common word, and T is at position 1? T O W I T -> but I is forbidden and also T is at position 1 and 5? But we don't know about duplicates. However, I is forbidden.

Another one: ""BOWLT"" - not a word.

""POWLT"" - not a word.

""VOLT"": not 5 letters.

""WOLT"": not 5 letters.

""YOLT"": not a word.

""BOULT"": as I thought earlier. It is a word (meaning a volume of water or a fold of skin). But let's see: B O U L T -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. So it fits the pattern.

But we have to check if B, U, L are allowed? Yes, they are not in the forbidden list.

Another word: ""DOULT"" - not a word.

""JOULT"" - not a word.

""COULT"" - C is forbidden.

""FOULT"" - not a standard word.

""LOUTH"" - not common.

""TOUCH"" - but that ends with H, not T.

We have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Are there others?

""POUTY"" is not ending with T.

""ROUT"" is 4 letters.

""GROUP"" - but that doesn't end with T.

Another idea: ""BOLT"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters. So:

- ""DOUBT"": D O U B T
- ""BOULT"": B O U L T

But note: in ""BOULT"", the fourth letter is L, and fifth is T. So it fits.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested many letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""DOUBT"", we would test D, U, B.
In ""BOULT"", we test B, U, L.

We already know O and T are in the word and in the correct positions, so we don't need to test them again? But we are using them to complete the word.

We also have to avoid the forbidden letters: so D, U, B, L are all available.

But we don't know if U is in the word. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters. For example, we haven't tested L, D, U, B, etc.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2, so we are on the third guess.

We can also consider other words that fit the pattern.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.

""JOUST"" has S and is forbidden.

""TOAST"" has A and S, both forbidden.

""BOAST"" has A and S.

What about ""BOOTH""? But it ends with H, not T.

We need the fifth letter to be T.

Another word: ""DOZEN"" - but E is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main candidates.

But let's check if there are others.

""COVET"" - but C is forbidden and it ends with T? C O V E T -> but E is forbidden and the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be the one before T. In ""COVET"", it's C-O-V-E-T, so the fourth letter is E (forbidden) and fifth is T. But E is forbidden, so we cannot use it.

""ROVET"" - not a word and R is forbidden.

""LOVAT"" - not common.

""DOVAT"" - not a word.

""GOAT"" is 4 letters.

So, perhaps ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the only common words? But let's think of ""JOULT"" - not a word.

""TOULT"" - not a word.

""BOULT"" is acceptable? Or ""DOULT"" is not a word. But ""BOULT"" is a word.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.

""JOUST"" is forbidden.

""TOUCH"" ends with H.

We have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Let me check if there is ""FOULT"" - it might be a variant, but typically we use ""FAULT"" which is 5 letters and has A (forbidden).

Perhaps ""BOULT"" is the best? Or ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have not tested U, B, D, L, etc.

We can also consider ""GOUTY"" - but that ends with Y and has G, O, U, T, Y. But the pattern requires the fifth letter to be T, so it must end with T. ""GOUTY"" ends with Y.

Another word: ""DOUTY"" - not a word.

""BOUTY"" - not a word.

So, I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main options.

But let's see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both words use allowed letters.

We can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

What about ""LOUTY""? Not a word.

""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.

I think we have to choose between ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"".

But note: in ""DOUBT"", the fourth letter is B and fifth is T. In ""BOULT"", the fourth is L and fifth is T.

We can also think of ""COVET"" but forbidden letters.

Another word: ""DOWTY"" - not a word.

""ROWTH"" - not a word.

""BOGUS"" - but S is forbidden and it doesn't end with T.

I think we have to go with ""DOUBT"" or ""BOULT"".

But let's see the feedback: we have O and T fixed. We need to test the other positions.

We can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

What about ""JOUST"" - forbidden.

Perhaps ""TOUCH"" is not ending with T.

I found: ""BOULT"" is a word (meaning a fold of skin or a volume of water). It is accepted in some dictionaries.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"" because it is more common.

But note: in ""DOUBT"", we have:
- D: not tested before
- O: already known and in correct position
- U: not tested
- B: not tested
- T: already known and in correct position

So we are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Alternatively, if we want to test more vowels, U is a vowel we haven't tested.

But we already have two vowels? O is already known, and U is new.

So, let's choose ""DOUBT"".

But wait, what about the first letter? We can try D.

Another word: ""BOULT"" has B at the first position.

But we don't know which one.

We can also consider ""POUTY"" but it ends with Y, not T.

Or ""JOUST"" is forbidden.

I think ""DOUBT"" is a good choice.

But let's check the forbidden letters: we are using D, O, U, B, T. O and T are known, so we are testing D, U, B.

If we get all x for D, U, B, then we know they are not in the word, and we can try other letters.

But we have to use the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily have O and T in the same positions? But we know they must be there, so we should use them to get more information about the other positions.

But in this case, we are forced to use O in second and T in fifth.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters, valid, and not use forbidden letters.

""DOUBT"" is a valid word.

So, guess: ""DOUBT""

But note: the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so ""DOUBT"" fits: D O U B T.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get feedback, we can make the next guess.

So, the next guess is ""doubt"".

But wait, what if the word is ""BOULT""? Then we would get it wrong, but we have more tries.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has more new letters? For example, we could try a word that has L, but then we have to fit the pattern.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

Another word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.

I think ""DOUBT"" is fine.

But let me think of ""GOUTY"": G O U T Y -> but that ends with Y, not T. So no.

""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.

So, I'll go with ""DOUBT"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DOUBT"" uses D, O, U, B, T. O and T are allowed because they are known to be in the word. The new letters are D, U, B.

We are testing D, U, B.

If we get:
- D: if it's in the word and in the correct position? Or if it's present but wrong position? Or absent.

Similarly for U and B.

This will give us information.

So, the guess is ""doubt"".

But let me write it in uppercase: DOUBT.

However, in the previous guess we used ""moist"" in lowercase, so I'll use lowercase.

So, <guess>doubt</guess>

But wait, what about ""BOULT""? It is a word, but less common. So ""DOUBT"" is better.

Alternatively, we can try ""POUTY"" but it doesn't end with T, so it would be invalid because we know the fifth letter must be T.

So, we must have the fifth letter T.

Therefore, I choose ""doubt"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → O is correct and in position 2 (✓), T is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, I, S are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **O** as the second letter and **T** as the fifth letter, so the pattern is: `_ O _ _ T`.
- Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S**.
- Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, T are already confirmed but must be reused in positions 2 and 5).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ O _ _ T` using only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, L, B, P) and the vowel U to maximize information.
- **""doubt""** is a strong choice:
  - Fits the pattern: `D O U B T`.
  - Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **U** (position 3), and **B** (position 4).
  - Avoids eliminated letters and reuses O and T in their known positions to confirm the pattern.

We can consider other vowels and consonants.\n Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)\n Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible. A good second guess might include letters like S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E). Some possibilities:\n\n Option 1: ""SPLIT"" - contains S, P, L, I, T. All these are new and not forbidden.\n Option 2: ""MOUTH"" - M, O, U, T, H. Also new letters.\n Option 3: ""BUMPY"" - B, U, M, P, Y. But note that Y can be a vowel.\n\n However, we want to maximize the information. Let\'s choose a word that has common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another idea: ""TOILS"" - T, O, I, L, S. All new.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. Since we haven\'t tried O, U, I, etc., let\'s include one or two of them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. This covers three vowels (I, O, U) and two common consonants (P, S).\n\n However, let\'s check if there\'s a word that covers more common letters. The word ""SLIPT"" is not common, but ""SPILT"" is a variant of split.\n\n Another common word: ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L. But O and U are vowels.\n\n Considering frequency of letters in 5-letter words, after avoiding C,R,A,N,E, the next most common letters are: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.\n\n We can try to form a word with S, T, L, O, and P. But note that we have 5 letters to choose.\n\n The word ""SLOP"" is not 5 letters. We need 5 letters. How about ""SLOPS""? But that has an S at the end and might be considered plural? Alternatively, ""SLOPE"" has E which is forbidden.\n\n Since E is forbidden, we cannot use words ending with E. Similarly, we cannot use words with E.\n\n Let me think of words without C,R,A,N,E. Some options:\n\n - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all allowed.\n - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> allowed.\n - ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> allowed.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T which are common and we haven\'t tried them.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> allowed.\n\n But note: we want to avoid using too many vowels if we are not sure, but we need to test vowels.

A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:\n- Uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all untested.\n- Covers three vowels (O, I) and two high-frequency consonants (S, T).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n\nThis guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities by testing new letters in key positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

Actually, in the pattern, we know the second letter is O and fifth is T, so we must use O in the second position and T in the fifth.

No, 5-letter words.\n\nActually, the pattern is: [1]O[3][4]T\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: any letter except forbidden (so B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)\n- Position 3: same set\n- Position 4: same set\n\nCommon words:\n- ""DOUT"": not 5 letters.\n- ""GOUT"": not 5 letters.\n\nActually, let\'s think:\n- ""BOUT"" is 4 letters.

That would be positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. But we have T at the end, which is correct. However, we have to avoid forbidden letters. B, U, L are allowed? Yes, because they are not in the forbidden list.\n\nBut is ""BOULT"" a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. However, we can also think of more common words.\n\nAnother one: ""POUTY"" - but that ends with Y, not T. We need T at the end.\n\nWords ending with T and second letter O:\n- ""BOOTH"": B O O T H? But that has two O\'s? And the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be H? Actually, ""BOOTH"" is B-O-O-T-H, so positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:T, 5:H? But we need the fifth letter to be T, but here it\'s H. So no.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be T, so the word must end with T.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUBT"": D O U B T -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:B, 5:T. This fits the pattern. And D, U, B are not forbidden.\n\nBut is ""DOUBT"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GROUT"": G R O U T -> but R is forbidden (from first guess: R is absent). So we cannot use R.\n\nSimilarly, ""TROUT"": T R O U T -> R is forbidden.\n\n""BLOUT"": not a common word.\n\n""POUT"": not 5 letters.\n\n""JOUST"": J O U S T -> but S is forbidden (from second guess: S is absent).

Let me check: perhaps ""FAULT"" is the common one, but that has A (forbidden) and U, L, T. But A is forbidden.\n\nWe need to avoid A, so ""FAULT"" is out.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUTH"": but M is forbidden (from second guess: M is absent) and we have O in the second position? M O U T H -> but the fifth letter is H, not T. And we need T at the end.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be T.\n\nLet me list words ending with T and second letter O:\n- DOUBT: D O U B T\n- GROUT: but R is forbidden and also T is at the end, but the fourth letter is U? G R O U T -> forbidden R.\n- TOWIT: not a common word, and T is at position 1? T O W I T -> but I is forbidden and also T is at position 1 and 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates. However, I is forbidden.\n\nAnother one: ""BOWLT"" - not a word.\n\n""POWLT"" - not a word.\n\n""VOLT"": not 5 letters.\n\n""WOLT"": not 5 letters.\n\n""YOLT"": not a word.\n\n""BOULT"": as I thought earlier. It is a word (meaning a volume of water or a fold of skin). But let\'s see: B O U L T -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:U, 4:L, 5:T. So it fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if B, U, L are allowed?

Are there others?\n\n""POUTY"" is not ending with T.\n\n""ROUT"" is 4 letters.\n\n""GROUP"" - but that doesn\'t end with T.\n\nAnother idea: ""BOLT"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters. So:\n\n- ""DOUBT"": D O U B T\n- ""BOULT"": B O U L T\n\nBut note: in ""BOULT"", the fourth letter is L, and fifth is T. So it fits.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we haven\'t tested many letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""DOUBT"", we would test D, U, B.\nIn ""BOULT"", we test B, U, L.\n\nWe already know O and T are in the word and in the correct positions, so we don\'t need to test them again? But we are using them to complete the word.\n\nWe also have to avoid the forbidden letters: so D, U, B, L are all available.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in the word. We are testing it.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters. For example, we haven\'t tested L, D, U, B, etc.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we have used 2, so we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider other words that fit the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.\n\n""JOUST"" has S and is forbidden.\n\n""TOAST"" has A and S, both forbidden.\n\n""BOAST"" has A and S.\n\nWhat about ""BOOTH""? But it ends with H, not T.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be T.\n\nAnother word: ""DOZEN"" - but E is forbidden and it doesn\'t end with T.\n\nI think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are others.\n\n""COVET"" - but C is forbidden and it ends with T? C O V E T -> but E is forbidden and the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so the fourth letter must be the one before T. In ""COVET"", it\'s C-O-V-E-T, so the fourth letter is E (forbidden) and fifth is T. But E is forbidden, so we cannot use it.\n\n""ROVET"" - not a word and R is forbidden.\n\n""LOVAT"" - not common.\n\n""DOVAT"" - not a word.\n\n""GOAT"" is 4 letters.\n\nSo, perhaps ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the only common words? But let\'s think of ""JOULT"" - not a word.\n\n""TOULT"" - not a word.\n\n""BOULT"" is acceptable? Or ""DOULT"" is not a word. But ""BOULT"" is a word.\n\nAnother word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but ends with Y.\n\n""JOUST"" is forbidden.\n\n""TOUCH"" ends with H.\n\nWe have ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"". Let me check if there is ""FOULT"" - it might be a variant, but typically we use ""FAULT"" which is 5 letters and has A (forbidden).\n\nPerhaps ""BOULT"" is the best? Or ""DOUBT"".\n\nBut note: we have not tested U, B, D, L, etc.\n\nWe can also consider ""GOUTY"" - but that ends with Y and has G, O, U, T, Y. But the pattern requires the fifth letter to be T, so it must end with T. ""GOUTY"" ends with Y.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUTY"" - not a word.\n\n""BOUTY"" - not a word.\n\nSo, I think ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"" are the main options.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both words use allowed letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.\n\nWhat about ""LOUTY""? Not a word.\n\n""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.\n\nI think we have to choose between ""DOUBT"" and ""BOULT"".\n\nBut note: in ""DOUBT"", the fourth letter is B and fifth is T. In ""BOULT"", the fourth is L and fifth is T.\n\nWe can also think of ""COVET"" but forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DOWTY"" - not a word.\n\n""ROWTH"" - not a word.\n\n""BOGUS"" - but S is forbidden and it doesn\'t end with T.\n\nI think we have to go with ""DOUBT"" or ""BOULT"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback: we have O and T fixed. We need to test the other positions.\n\nWe can also consider ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.\n\nWhat about ""JOUST"" - forbidden.\n\nPerhaps ""TOUCH"" is not ending with T.\n\nI found: ""BOULT"" is a word (meaning a fold of skin or a volume of water). It is accepted in some dictionaries.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUBT"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""DOUBT"" because it is more common.\n\nBut note: in ""DOUBT"", we have:\n- D: not tested before\n- O: already known and in correct position\n- U: not tested\n- B: not tested\n- T: already known and in correct position\n\nSo we are testing D, U, B.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to test more vowels, U is a vowel we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we already have two vowels? O is already known, and U is new.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""DOUBT"".\n\nBut wait, what about the first letter? We can try D.\n\nAnother word: ""BOULT"" has B at the first position.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one.\n\nWe can also consider ""POUTY"" but it ends with Y, not T.\n\nOr ""JOUST"" is forbidden.\n\nI think ""DOUBT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the forbidden letters: we are using D, O, U, B, T. O and T are known, so we are testing D, U, B.\n\nIf we get all x for D, U, B, then we know they are not in the word, and we can try other letters.\n\nBut we have to use the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t necessarily have O and T in the same positions? But we know they must be there, so we should use them to get more information about the other positions.\n\nBut in this case, we are forced to use O in second and T in fifth.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""DOUBT"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters, valid, and not use forbidden letters.\n\n""DOUBT"" is a valid word.\n\nSo, guess: ""DOUBT""\n\nBut note: the pattern is _ O _ _ T, so ""DOUBT"" fits: D O U B T.\n\nWe are testing D, U, B.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can make the next guess.\n\nSo, the next guess is ""doubt"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word is ""BOULT""? Then we would get it wrong, but we have more tries.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has more new letters? For example, we could try a word that has L, but then we have to fit the pattern.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""POUT"" is not 5 letters. ""POUTY"" is 5 but not ending with T.\n\nI think ""DOUBT"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think of ""GOUTY"": G O U T Y -> but that ends with Y, not T. So no.\n\n""TOUK"" is not 5 letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""DOUBT"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DOUBT"" uses D, O, U, B, T. O and T are allowed because they are known to be in the word. The new letters are D, U, B.\n\nWe are testing D, U, B.\n\nIf we get:\n- D: if it\'s in the word and in the correct position? Or if it\'s present but wrong position? Or absent.\n\nSimilarly for U and B.\n\nThis will give us information.\n\nSo, the guess is ""doubt"".\n\nBut let me write it in uppercase: DOUBT.\n\nHowever, in the previous guess we used ""moist"" in lowercase, so I\'ll use lowercase.\n\nSo, <guess>doubt</guess>\n\nBut wait, what about ""BOULT""? It is a word, but less common. So ""DOUBT"" is better.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""POUTY"" but it doesn\'t end with T, so it would be invalid because we know the fifth letter must be T.\n\nSo, we must have the fifth letter T.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""doubt"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: moist** → O is correct and in position 2 (✓), T is correct and in position 5 (✓). M, I, S are absent (x), so they are eliminated.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **O** as the second letter and **T** as the fifth letter, so the pattern is: `_ O _ _ T`.\n- Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S**.\n- Remaining letters to use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and O, T are already confirmed but must be reused in positions 2 and 5).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We need a 5-letter word fitting `_ O _ _ T` using only the remaining letters.\n- Prioritize testing new high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, L, B, P) and the vowel U to maximize information.\n- **""doubt""** is a strong choice:\n  - Fits the pattern: `D O U B T`.\n  - Tests new letters: **D** (position 1), **U** (position 3), and **B** (position 4).\n  - Avoids eliminated letters and reuses O and T in their known positions to confirm the pattern.\n\n<guess>doubt</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(x) T(✓)\nGuess 3: doubt -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(✓) B(-) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent
   - O: correct and in position 2
   - I: absent
   - S: absent
   - T: correct and in position 5
3. ""doubt"" ->
   - D: absent
   - O: correct and in position 2 (as before)
   - U: correct and in position 3? Let's see: ""doubt"" is D-O-U-B-T, so:
     - D in position 1: absent (x)
     - O in position 2: correct (✓)
     - U in position 3: correct (✓) -> so the third letter is U!
     - B in position 4: present but wrong position (-) -> so B is in the word but not in position 4.
     - T in position 5: correct (✓)

Therefore, from ""doubt"":
- The third letter is U. So now we know the pattern: _ O U _ T
- B is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is absent.

So, the secret word is of the form: _ O U _ T

And we know B is present, but not in position 4.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, D.

And we have confirmed: O in position 2, U in position 3, T in position 5.

So, the word has: [letter1] O U [letter4] T

We know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining letters, and B is one of them? Not necessarily, because B is present but not in position 4, so B must be in position 1 or letter4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and B is not there, so B must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 4, and B is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But note: B is marked as present but wrong position. Since the only positions available are 1 and 4, and B is not in 4, then it must be in position 1? Or could it be that the word has B in position 1 and also elsewhere? But we don't know about duplicates.

However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates, so we assume B is in position 1? But let's not jump to conclusions.

Actually, the feedback for ""doubt"": B is marked as present but wrong position. In the word, B is in position 4, but it's wrong position, so B is not in position 4. Since the only other position is position 1, B must be in position 1? But wait, the word has positions 1, 4, and we know position 2 is O and 3 is U, 5 is T. So the word is: [1] O U [4] T

And B is in the word but not in position 4. So B must be in position 1? Because position 2,3,5 are fixed and not B (O is not B, U is not B, T is not B). So the only possibility is that B is in position 1.

But is that necessarily true? The word could have B in position 1, and then the fourth letter is something else. But since B is present and not in position 4, and positions 2,3,5 are occupied by O,U,T which are not B, then B must be in position 1.

Therefore, we can deduce that the first letter is B? But we haven't tested B in position 1. We know B is in the word, and the only position left for it is position 1 because position 4 is the only other one, and it's not there. So B must be in position 1.

But wait, what if the word has B in position 1 and also in position 4? But we don't have any feedback that B is in position 4? In ""doubt"", we had B in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means B is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't say anything about position 1. So B could be in position 1, and the fourth letter is something else.

But if B were in position 1, then in ""doubt"", the first letter is D (which is absent) so position 1 is not B. But we know B is present, so it must be that B is in position 1, and the fourth letter is something else.

Alternatively, if the word had B in position 1 and also in position 4, then when we put B in position 4, it should be correct? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that B is not in position 4, so it cannot be that B is in position 4 and also elsewhere. Therefore, B must be in position 1.

So, the word must start with B? Then the pattern is: B O U _ T

Now, we need the fourth letter. The word is: B O U [letter4] T

We know the letter4 must be one that is not forbidden and not already eliminated.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, D.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know B, O, U, T are in the word, but O and U are already placed, and T is at the end).

So, we need a letter for position 4 from: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits: B O U _ T

What words are there?

- BOUT: not 5 letters.
- BOULT: but we have U in position 3, so BOULT would be B O U L T, which has L in position 4. Is L allowed? Yes, L is not forbidden.

But wait, in our pattern, position 3 is U, so BOULT would be B O U L T. That fits.

But we already have U in position 3, so BOULT is a candidate? But in BOULT, the fourth letter is L, and fifth is T. And we have B in first, O in second, U in third, L in fourth, T in fifth.

But we also have feedback that B is present and not in position 4, which is satisfied if B is in position 1 and L is in position 4.

But is BOULT a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. It means a fold of skin or a volume of water.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: BOWLT? Not a word.

BOWNT? Not a word.

BOUTS? But S is forbidden and it's plural? And S is forbidden.

BOULT is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""BOUGH""? But that doesn't end with T.

We need the word to end with T.

Another word: ""BOUTS"" is not ending with T and has S.

""BOULT"" seems to be the only common word.

But let me confirm: is there ""BOULT"" in standard Wordle? I think so.

But we have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

What about ""BOWLT""? Not a word.

""BOXT"" is 4 letters.

""BOXET"" - but E is forbidden.

""BUOYT"" - not a word.

So, BOULT is a candidate.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested L. So if we guess BOULT, we test L.

But we might be able to test more letters? We have to fill the fourth position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter to test more letters? But we are almost there.

We know the word is B O U ? T, and the fourth letter must be one of the available letters.

We can try BOULT directly.

But to be safe, we might test another letter? However, we have only two positions left: position 1 and 4. We know position 1 must be B (as deduced), and position 4 must be L (as in BOULT). But is that necessarily true?

Wait, we deduced that B must be in position 1. But is that correct? Let me reexamine.

The word has B present, and it must be in position 1 because:
- Position 2: O (not B)
- Position 3: U (not B)
- Position 5: T (not B)

And position 4: we know it's not B (from feedback: B is not in position 4). So the only position left for B is position 1.

Therefore, the word must start with B.

So, the pattern is: B O U _ T

Now, what letters can go in the fourth position? We have to avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,D.

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Now, what words are there? BOULT is one. Are there others?

- BOUTS: S forbidden and not ending with T.
- BOUGH: not ending with T.
- BROWN: has R and N, forbidden.
- BRUNT: has R, forbidden.
- BUILT: has I, forbidden.
- BUILD: has I and D, forbidden.
- BULGY: not ending with T.
- BUMPT: not a word.
- BUNTY: not ending with T and has U? But pattern: B U N T Y -> but position 3 is U, but position 2 is U? No, position 2 is O, not U. So B O U _ T, not B U _ T.

So, the only common word I can think of is BOULT.

But let me think: is there ""BOUTT""? Not a word.

""BOUET"" - but E is forbidden.

""BOULE"" - E forbidden.

""BOUMT"" - not a word.

So, BOULT seems to be the only possibility.

But what about ""BOULT"" itself? We can guess it.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we have only one unknown letter (the fourth one) and we know the first letter must be B.

But we don't know the fourth letter. We have to guess.

We can try BOULT.

But note: we have not tested L. So if we guess BOULT, and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on L.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can try BOULT.

But let's see if there are other words.

What about ""BOUPT""? Not a word.

""BOVVT""? Not a word.

""BOXUT""? Not a word.

So, BOULT is the only common word.

But we must consider that the fourth letter might be something else. For example, is there a word like ""BOUTT""? No.

Or ""BOUAT""? But A is forbidden.

I think BOULT is the word.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Possible words: 
- BOULT (L in position 4)
- BOUTS (but S is forbidden and it's plural, and not ending with T? BOUTS ends with S)
- BROWN (forbidden letters)
- BRUNT (forbidden)
- BUILD (forbidden letters)
- BULGY (not ending with T)

Another one: ""BOWLT"" - not a word.

""BOYDT"" - not a word.

""BOZRT"" - not a word.

So, only BOULT seems to fit.

But what about ""BOOZT""? Not a word.

Or ""BOUKT""? Not a word.

I think BOULT is the only common English word that fits: B O U L T.

Therefore, we should guess BOULT.

But let me double-check the feedback.

In ""doubt"", we had B in position 4 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is BOULT, then:
- Position 1: B (which we haven't tested before)
- Position 2: O (correct)
- Position 3: U (correct)
- Position 4: L (which we are about to test)
- Position 5: T (correct)

And in BOULT, B is in position 1, so when we guessed ""doubt"", we had B in position 4 (which is wrong) and U in position 3 (correct). The feedback for B was that it is present but not in position 4, which is consistent if B is in position 1.

So, BOULT fits.

Therefore, we guess BOULT.

But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words? But I can't think of any.

What about ""BOUVT""? Not a word.

""BOVVT"" - no.

So, I think BOULT is the word.

Thus, the next guess is BOULT.

But let me write it.

### Analysis of Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Eliminated letters: **C, R, A, N, E**.
2. **Guess 2: moist** → 
   - O is correct and in position 2 (✓).
   - T is correct and in position 5 (✓).
   - M, I, S are absent (x). Eliminated letters: **M, I, S**.
3. **Guess 3: doubt** → 
   - O is correct and in position 2 (✓) — already known.
   - U is correct and in position 3 (✓) — new information!
   - B is present but wrong position (-) — so **B** is in the word, but not in position 4.
   - T is correct and in position 5 (✓) — already known.
   - D is absent (x) — eliminate **D**.

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O U _ T` (positions: 1=unknown, 2=O, 3=U, 4=unknown, 5=T).
- **Confirmed letters**: 
  - **O** (position 2), **U** (position 3), **T** (position 5).
- **Present letters**: 
  - **B** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""doubt"" feedback). Since positions 2, 3, and 5 are fixed (O, U, T), **B must be in position 1** (the only position left for B).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, D (9 letters total).
- **Remaining letters**: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and B, O, U, T are confirmed but must be reused).

### Deductions:
- The word starts with **B** (position 1) (since B must be in position 1, as deduced above).
- The pattern is now **B O U _ T**.
- The fourth letter must be one of the remaining letters (F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- **BOULT** (B O U L T) is the only common English word that fits:
  - **B** in position 1 (tests the deduction).
  - **L** in position 4 (tests the remaining letter).
- If correct, this solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on **L** will reveal the answer (e.g., if L is correct, we get ✓; if absent, we eliminate L and try next letter).

### Next Guess:
We guess **BOULT** to test the deduced pattern and the letter L. If correct, we win. If not, we eliminate L and try another letter (e.g., try P or H in position 4).

<guess>boult</guess>",boult,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> 
   - M: absent
   - O: correct and in position 2
   - I: absent
   - S: absent
   - T: correct and in position 5
3. ""doubt"" ->
   - D: absent
   - O: correct and in position 2 (as before)
   - U: correct and in position 3? Let's see: ""doubt"" is D-O-U-B-T, so:
     - D in position 1: absent (x)
     - O in position 2: correct (✓)
     - U in position 3: correct (✓) -> so the third letter is U!
     - B in position 4: present but wrong position (-) -> so B is in the word but not in position 4.
     - T in position 5: correct (✓)

Therefore, from ""doubt"":
- The third letter is U. So now we know the pattern: _ O U _ T
- B is in the word but not in position 4.
- D is absent.

So, the secret word is of the form: _ O U _ T

And we know B is present, but not in position 4.

Also, from previous feedback, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, D.

And we have confirmed: O in position 2, U in position 3, T in position 5.

So, the word has: [letter1] O U [letter4] T

We know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining letters, and B is one of them? Not necessarily, because B is present but not in position 4, so B must be in position 1 or letter4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and B is not there, so B must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and 4, and B is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1? Not necessarily, because the word might have more than one occurrence of a letter? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But note: B is marked as present but wrong position. Since the only positions available are 1 and 4, and B is not in 4, then it must be in position 1? Or could it be that the word has B in position 1 and also elsewhere? But we don't know about duplicates.

However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates, so we assume B is in position 1? But let's not jump to conclusions.

Actually, the feedback for ""doubt"": B is marked as present but wrong position. In the word, B is in position 4, but it's wrong position, so B is not in position 4. Since the only other position is position 1, B must be in position 1? But wait, the word has positions 1, 4, and we know position 2 is O and 3 is U, 5 is T. So the word is: [1] O U [4] T

And B is in the word but not in position 4. So B must be in position 1? Because position 2,3,5 are fixed and not B (O is not B, U is not B, T is not B). So the only possibility is that B is in position 1.

But is that necessarily true? The word could have B in position 1, and then the fourth letter is something else. But since B is present and not in position 4, and positions 2,3,5 are occupied by O,U,T which are not B, then B must be in position 1.

Therefore, we can deduce that the first letter is B? But we haven't tested B in position 1. We know B is in the word, and the only position left for it is position 1 because position 4 is the only other one, and it's not there. So B must be in position 1.

But wait, what if the word has B in position 1 and also in position 4? But we don't have any feedback that B is in position 4? In ""doubt"", we had B in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means B is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't say anything about position 1. So B could be in position 1, and the fourth letter is something else.

But if B were in position 1, then in ""doubt"", the first letter is D (which is absent) so position 1 is not B. But we know B is present, so it must be that B is in position 1, and the fourth letter is something else.

Alternatively, if the word had B in position 1 and also in position 4, then when we put B in position 4, it should be correct? But it was marked as wrong position, meaning that B is not in position 4, so it cannot be that B is in position 4 and also elsewhere. Therefore, B must be in position 1.

So, the word must start with B? Then the pattern is: B O U _ T

Now, we need the fourth letter. The word is: B O U [letter4] T

We know the letter4 must be one that is not forbidden and not already eliminated.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, S, D.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know B, O, U, T are in the word, but O and U are already placed, and T is at the end).

So, we need a letter for position 4 from: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits: B O U _ T

What words are there?

- BOUT: not 5 letters.
- BOULT: but we have U in position 3, so BOULT would be B O U L T, which has L in position 4. Is L allowed? Yes, L is not forbidden.

But wait, in our pattern, position 3 is U, so BOULT would be B O U L T. That fits.

But we already have U in position 3, so BOULT is a candidate? But in BOULT, the fourth letter is L, and fifth is T. And we have B in first, O in second, U in third, L in fourth, T in fifth.

But we also have feedback that B is present and not in position 4, which is satisfied if B is in position 1 and L is in position 4.

But is BOULT a valid word? It might be accepted in some dictionaries. It means a fold of skin or a volume of water.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

Another word: BOWLT? Not a word.

BOWNT? Not a word.

BOUTS? But S is forbidden and it's plural? And S is forbidden.

BOULT is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""BOUGH""? But that doesn't end with T.

We need the word to end with T.

Another word: ""BOUTS"" is not ending with T and has S.

""BOULT"" seems to be the only common word.

But let me confirm: is there ""BOULT"" in standard Wordle? I think so.

But we have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

What about ""BOWLT""? Not a word.

""BOXT"" is 4 letters.

""BOXET"" - but E is forbidden.

""BUOYT"" - not a word.

So, BOULT is a candidate.

But we also have to consider that we haven't tested L. So if we guess BOULT, we test L.

But we might be able to test more letters? We have to fill the fourth position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter to test more letters? But we are almost there.

- Position 5: T (not B)

And position 4: we know it's not B (from feedback: B is not in position 4). So the only position left for B is position 1.

Therefore, the word must start with B.

So, the pattern is: B O U _ T

Now, what letters can go in the fourth position? We have to avoid forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I,S,D.

Available letters: F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

- BULGY: not ending with T.
- BUMPT: not a word.
- BUNTY: not ending with T and has U? But pattern: B U N T Y -> but position 3 is U, but position 2 is U? No, position 2 is O, not U. So B O U _ T, not B U _ T.

So, the only common word I can think of is BOULT.

But let me think: is there ""BOUTT""? Not a word.

""BOUET"" - but E is forbidden.

""BOULE"" - E forbidden.

""BOUMT"" - not a word.

So, BOULT seems to be the only possibility.

But what about ""BOULT"" itself? We can guess it.
