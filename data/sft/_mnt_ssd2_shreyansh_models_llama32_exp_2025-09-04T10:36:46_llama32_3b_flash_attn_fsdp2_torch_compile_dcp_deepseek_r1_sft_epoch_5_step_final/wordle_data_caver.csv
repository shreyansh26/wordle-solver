 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.

<guess>caret</guess>",caret,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.",Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.

But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.\n\n We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n   - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list the positions: \n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don\'t have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.\n\n However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.\n\n But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).\n\n So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven\'t discovered yet.\n\n We don\'t know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don\'t have any other known absent letters).\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N.\n\n We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).\n Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).\n E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _\n\n But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:\n   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.\n   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _\n\n But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.\n\n However, we must check if that fits the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _\n\n But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). \n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   ""CAREX"" - but that\'s not a common word? And we don\'t know if it\'s valid.\n   ""CARLE"" - not a word.\n   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET""? \n   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:\n     Position 1: C -> correct.\n     Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. \n     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.\n     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.\n     Position 5: T -> new letter.\n\n But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.\n\n In the first guess, we had:\n   C R A N E\n   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n\n Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:\n   C: ✓ (correct)\n   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   N: not in the word -> consistent.\n   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.\n\n But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don\'t have feedback for the second guess. So we can\'t be sure.\n\n But let\'s see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.\n\n We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).\n\n Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).\n\n Some words:\n   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T\n   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.\n\n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.\n\n   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.\n\n But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:\n   In ""CATER"": \n      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.\n      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: \n   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that\'s a new position, so that\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are testing T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.\n\n Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? \n\n But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don\'t know about T, S, D, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that\'s not common) or ""CRATE"".\n\n However, ""CRATE"": \n   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""CARET"": \n   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).\n\n But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\n However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).\n\n So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait, what about the letter T? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word. We are testing it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used (like S) and also tests the positions.\n\n How about ""CARES""? \n   C A R E S -> positions: \n      1: C\n      2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2 before? We only know it\'s not in 3)\n      3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know it\'s not in 2)\n      4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know it\'s not in 5)\n      5: S (new)\n\n This word is valid.\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that\'s safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).\n\n So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.\n\n But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.\n\n We don\'t know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about T and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used and also rearranges the known letters.\n\n But we have to start with C.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? \n   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn\'t have R.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s stick with words that have all three.\n\n We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.\n\n How about ""CARED""? \n   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.\n\n However, we have to choose one.\n\n Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.\n\n But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.\n\n So let\'s guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.\n\n However, we are allowed to test new positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn\'t have A.\n\n We must have A, R, E.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""CARET"": \n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we don\'t know if it\'s correct, but we are testing)\n      Position 3: R (testing)\n      Position 4: E (testing)\n      Position 5: T (testing)\n\n If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.\n\n But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a \'-\' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a \'-\' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.\n\n But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)\n   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)\n\n But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.\n\n But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it\'s not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".\n\n But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.\n\n For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn\'t start with C.\n\n We must start with C.\n\n How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.\n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CARES""? That\'s valid.\n\n But let me see: we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _\n\n But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? \n   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.\n\n Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\n So it\'s hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? \n\n Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _\n\n But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? \n   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ \n   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.\n\n So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.\n\n After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I will go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about ""CARES""? It\'s also a valid word. Let me check: \n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: \n        1: C\n        2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)\n        3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)\n        4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)\n        5: S (new)\n\n This is also a valid word.\n\n But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about S or T.\n\n Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I\'ll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""CARET""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:\n   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _\n\n Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. \n\n Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.\n\n How about ""CESAR""? But that\'s not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? \n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.\n\n How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don\'t know about D.\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don\'t know which one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.\n\n But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.\n\n However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.\n\n For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don\'t know.\n\n After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I\'ll go with that.\n\n Guess: ""CARET""\n\n<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- **N** is not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n1.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).
- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it's not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.

But let's check: 
  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.

But what about position 3? We don't have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.

Therefore, the only position left for R is 5.

So the word is: C, A, ?, E, R

But wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).

So the word is: C A ? E R

Now, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters can be in position 3? 
  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don't have a full list.

We have to consider: what letters are possible? 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.

But the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried.

We don't know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.

So the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.

So the pattern is: C A ? E R

What words fit this pattern?
  We can think of words like: 
    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that's not common.
    ""CAUER"" (not a word)
    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.

Actually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.

Similarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

What about ""CARES""? 
  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it's not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.

Therefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).

So we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).

Possible letters for X: 
  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So X must be a new letter that we haven't tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.

So the available letters: 
  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.

But we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven't used.

We can list the available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)
  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.
  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.
  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A
        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.

  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.

  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).

  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).

  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.

  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).

  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.

  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.

  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).

So the candidates are:
  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R
  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R
  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R
  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So that's consistent.

Similarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it's correct.

And R is in position 5 and we haven't tested that position for R.

So we can try one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.

But we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don't know.

We can try ""CAKER"". If it's not, we get feedback on K.

But we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we can also try a word that doesn't follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""CABER""? Not a word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.

So the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's stick to common words.

We can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.

Another word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

So the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that's not a word and doesn't end with R.

We must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.

So we have to choose one of the candidates.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.

So the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.

Another idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that's not possible.

Similarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.

So we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's assume the common ones.

We can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

So let's guess ""CAKER"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But let me double-check the feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that's consistent.
  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that's consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn't put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.

  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.
  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

Second guess: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that's correct.
  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it's wrong, which is consistent.
  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that's correct.
  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.

So ""CAKER"" is consistent.

Similarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".

But we don't know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.

We can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.

I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don't have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E's? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if the word had two E's, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E's? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn't have another E. So it's possible, but we have no evidence.

But we can rule out duplicates? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

We can try ""CAKER"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

So we can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAJER""? Not a word.

So I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".

But let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". 

If the word is ""CALER"": 
  C A L E R
  Our guess: C A K E R
  Feedback: 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it's wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".

But if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.

So the guess is ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

So let's go with ""CAKER"".

After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). The only remaining position is 5. Thus, **R = position 5**.
- **Absent letters**: **N** and **T** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **R** (known from feedback).
  - Cannot be **N** or **T** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested (and not **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** for now, given no duplicates indicated).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must be **C A _ E R**.
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **CAKER**, **CALER**, **CAPER**, **CAVER**.
- **CAKER** is chosen to test **K** in position 3:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **K** will confirm/eliminate it, narrowing options to **CALER**/**CAPER** for subsequent guesses.

<guess>kaker</guess>",kaker,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).
- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it's not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.

But let's check: 
  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.

But what about position 3? We don't have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.

Therefore, the only position left for R is 5.

So the word is: C, A, ?, E, R

But wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).

So the word is: C A ? E R

Now, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters can be in position 3? 
  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don't have a full list.

We have to consider: what letters are possible? 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.

But the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried.

We don't know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.

So the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.

So the pattern is: C A ? E R

What words fit this pattern?
  We can think of words like: 
    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that's not common.
    ""CAUER"" (not a word)
    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.

Actually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.

Similarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

What about ""CARES""? 
  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it's not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.

Therefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).

So we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).

Possible letters for X: 
  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So X must be a new letter that we haven't tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.

So the available letters: 
  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.

But we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven't used.

We can list the available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)
  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.
  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.
  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A
        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.

  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.

  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).

  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).

  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.

  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).

  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.

  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.

  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).

So the candidates are:
  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R
  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R
  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R
  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So that's consistent.

Similarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it's correct.

And R is in position 5 and we haven't tested that position for R.

So we can try one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.

But we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don't know.

We can try ""CAKER"". If it's not, we get feedback on K.

But we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we can also try a word that doesn't follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""CABER""? Not a word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.

So the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's stick to common words.

We can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.

Another word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

So the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that's not a word and doesn't end with R.

We must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.

So we have to choose one of the candidates.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.

So the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.

Another idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that's not possible.

Similarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.

So we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's assume the common ones.

We can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

So let's guess ""CAKER"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But let me double-check the feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that's consistent.
  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that's consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn't put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.

  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.
  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

Second guess: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that's correct.
  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it's wrong, which is consistent.
  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that's correct.
  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.

So ""CAKER"" is consistent.

Similarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".

But we don't know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.

We can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.

I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don't have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E's? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if the word had two E's, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E's? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn't have another E. So it's possible, but we have no evidence.

But we can rule out duplicates? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

We can try ""CAKER"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

So we can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAJER""? Not a word.

So I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".

But let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". 

If the word is ""CALER"": 
  C A L E R
  Our guess: C A K E R
  Feedback: 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it's wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".

But if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.

So the guess is ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

So let's go with ""CAKER"".

<guess>kaker</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). The only remaining position is 5. Thus, **R = position 5**.
- **Absent letters**: **N** and **T** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **R** (known from feedback).
  - Cannot be **N** or **T** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested (and not **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** for now, given no duplicates indicated).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must be **C A _ E R**.
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **CAKER**, **CALER**, **CAPER**, **CAVER**.
- **CAKER** is chosen to test **K** in position 3:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **K** will confirm/eliminate it, narrowing options to **CALER**/**CAPER** for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: kaker -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.

<guess>caret</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).
- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it's not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.

But let's check: 
  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.

But what about position 3? We don't have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.

Therefore, the only position left for R is 5.

So the word is: C, A, ?, E, R

But wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).

So the word is: C A ? E R

Now, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters can be in position 3? 
  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don't have a full list.

We have to consider: what letters are possible? 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.

But the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried.

We don't know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.

So the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.

So the pattern is: C A ? E R

What words fit this pattern?
  We can think of words like: 
    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that's not common.
    ""CAUER"" (not a word)
    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.

Actually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.

Similarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

What about ""CARES""? 
  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it's not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.

Therefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).

So we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).

Possible letters for X: 
  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So X must be a new letter that we haven't tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.

So the available letters: 
  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.

But we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven't used.

We can list the available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)
  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.
  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.
  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A
        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.

  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.

  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).

  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).

  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.

  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).

  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.

  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.

  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).

So the candidates are:
  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R
  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R
  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R
  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So that's consistent.

Similarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it's correct.

And R is in position 5 and we haven't tested that position for R.

So we can try one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.

But we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don't know.

We can try ""CAKER"". If it's not, we get feedback on K.

But we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we can also try a word that doesn't follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""CABER""? Not a word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.

So the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's stick to common words.

We can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.

Another word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

So the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that's not a word and doesn't end with R.

We must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.

So we have to choose one of the candidates.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.

So the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.

Another idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that's not possible.

Similarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.

So we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's assume the common ones.

We can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

So let's guess ""CAKER"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But let me double-check the feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that's consistent.
  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that's consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn't put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.

  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.
  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

Second guess: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that's correct.
  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it's wrong, which is consistent.
  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that's correct.
  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.

So ""CAKER"" is consistent.

Similarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".

But we don't know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.

We can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.

I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don't have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E's? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if the word had two E's, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E's? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn't have another E. So it's possible, but we have no evidence.

But we can rule out duplicates? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

We can try ""CAKER"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

So we can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAJER""? Not a word.

So I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".

But let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". 

If the word is ""CALER"": 
  C A L E R
  Our guess: C A K E R
  Feedback: 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it's wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".

But if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.

So the guess is ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

So let's go with ""CAKER"".

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). The only remaining position is 5. Thus, **R = position 5**.
- **Absent letters**: **N** and **T** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **R** (known from feedback).
  - Cannot be **N** or **T** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested (and not **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** for now, given no duplicates indicated).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must be **C A _ E R**.
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **CAKER**, **CALER**, **CAPER**, **CAVER**.
- **CAKER** is chosen to test **K** in position 3:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **K** will confirm/eliminate it, narrowing options to **CALER**/**CAPER** for subsequent guesses.

So the secret word starts with C.\n - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).\n - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.\n - The letter N is not in the word.\n - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n Also, note that the word does not contain N.\n\n Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _\n\n We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.\n\n We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.\n\n Let\'s think of possible positions for R, A, E.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.\n\n We must avoid using N.\n\n We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.\n\n However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.\n\n We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n   - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list the positions: \n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don\'t have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.\n\n However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.\n\n But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).\n\n So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven\'t discovered yet.\n\n We don\'t know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don\'t have any other known absent letters).\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N.\n\n We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).\n Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).\n E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _\n\n But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:\n   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.\n   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _\n\n But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.\n\n However, we must check if that fits the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _\n\n But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). \n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   ""CAREX"" - but that\'s not a common word? And we don\'t know if it\'s valid.\n   ""CARLE"" - not a word.\n   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET""? \n   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:\n     Position 1: C -> correct.\n     Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. \n     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.\n     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.\n     Position 5: T -> new letter.\n\n But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.\n\n In the first guess, we had:\n   C R A N E\n   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n\n Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:\n   C: ✓ (correct)\n   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   N: not in the word -> consistent.\n   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.\n\n But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don\'t have feedback for the second guess. So we can\'t be sure.\n\n But let\'s see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.\n\n We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).\n\n Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).\n\n Some words:\n   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T\n   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.\n\n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.\n\n   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.\n\n But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:\n   In ""CATER"": \n      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.\n      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: \n   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that\'s a new position, so that\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are testing T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.\n\n Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? \n\n But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don\'t know about T, S, D, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that\'s not common) or ""CRATE"".\n\n However, ""CRATE"": \n   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""CARET"": \n   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).\n\n But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\n However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).\n\n So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait, what about the letter T? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word. We are testing it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used (like S) and also tests the positions.\n\n How about ""CARES""? \n   C A R E S -> positions: \n      1: C\n      2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2 before? We only know it\'s not in 3)\n      3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know it\'s not in 2)\n      4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know it\'s not in 5)\n      5: S (new)\n\n This word is valid.\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that\'s safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).\n\n So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.\n\n But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.\n\n We don\'t know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about T and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used and also rearranges the known letters.\n\n But we have to start with C.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? \n   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn\'t have R.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s stick with words that have all three.\n\n We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.\n\n How about ""CARED""? \n   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.\n\n However, we have to choose one.\n\n Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.\n\n But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.\n\n So let\'s guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.\n\n However, we are allowed to test new positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn\'t have A.\n\n We must have A, R, E.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""CARET"": \n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we don\'t know if it\'s correct, but we are testing)\n      Position 3: R (testing)\n      Position 4: E (testing)\n      Position 5: T (testing)\n\n If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.\n\n But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a \'-\' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a \'-\' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.\n\n But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)\n   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)\n\n But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.\n\n But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it\'s not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".\n\n But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.\n\n For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn\'t start with C.\n\n We must start with C.\n\n How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.\n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CARES""? That\'s valid.\n\n But let me see: we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _\n\n But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? \n   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.\n\n Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\n So it\'s hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? \n\n Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _\n\n But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? \n   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ \n   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.\n\n So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.\n\n After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I will go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about ""CARES""? It\'s also a valid word. Let me check: \n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: \n        1: C\n        2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)\n        3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)\n        4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)\n        5: S (new)\n\n This is also a valid word.\n\n But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about S or T.\n\n Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I\'ll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""CARET""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:\n   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _\n\n Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. \n\n Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.\n\n How about ""CESAR""? But that\'s not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? \n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.\n\n How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don\'t know about D.\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don\'t know which one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.\n\n But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.\n\n However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.\n\n For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don\'t know.\n\n After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I\'ll go with that.\n\n Guess: ""CARET""\n\n<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- **N** is not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).\n3. **N** is absent.\n4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:\n- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).\n- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).\n- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).\n- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).\n- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.\n- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.\n\n<guess>caret</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again\n  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it\'s marked as wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).\n- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).\n- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it\'s not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? \n\nBut wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.\n\nBut let\'s check: \n  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.\n\nBut what about position 3? We don\'t have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a \'-\' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.\n\nTherefore, the only position left for R is 5.\n\nSo the word is: C, A, ?, E, R\n\nBut wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).\n\nSo the word is: C A ? E R\n\nNow, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWhat letters can be in position 3? \n  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don\'t have a full list.\n\nWe have to consider: what letters are possible? \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.\n\nBut the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe don\'t know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.\n\nSo the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.\n\nSo the pattern is: C A ? E R\n\nWhat words fit this pattern?\n  We can think of words like: \n    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that\'s not common.\n    ""CAUER"" (not a word)\n    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.\n\nActually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nWhat about ""CARES""? \n  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it\'s not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\nBut wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.\n\nTherefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).\n\nSo we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don\'t know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).\n\nPossible letters for X: \n  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo X must be a new letter that we haven\'t tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.\n\nSo the available letters: \n  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.\n\nBut we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven\'t used.\n\nWe can list the available letters: \n  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to choose a word that is common.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)\n  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.\n  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.\n  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": \n        Position 1: C\n        Position 2: A\n        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.\n\n  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.\n\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).\n\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).\n\n  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.\n\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).\n\n  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.\n\n  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.\n\n  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).\n\nSo the candidates are:\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R\n  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it\'s correct. So that\'s consistent.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct.\n\nAnd R is in position 5 and we haven\'t tested that position for R.\n\nSo we can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.\n\nBut we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"". If it\'s not, we get feedback on K.\n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.\n\nBut let me think: are there other words?\n\nWhat about ""CABER""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""CAYER""? Not a word.\n\nSo the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.\n\nSo the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nWe can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.\n\nAnother word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nSo the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that\'s not a word and doesn\'t end with R.\n\nWe must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.\n\nSo we have to choose one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.\n\nSo the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.\n\nAnother idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that\'s not possible.\n\nSimilarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.\n\nSo we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s assume the common ones.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that\'s consistent.\n  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that\'s consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn\'t put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.\n\n  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.\n  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nSecond guess: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that\'s correct.\n  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it\'s wrong, which is consistent.\n  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that\'s correct.\n  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.\n\nSo ""CAKER"" is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".\n\nBut we don\'t know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also try a word that doesn\'t use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.\n\nI think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nWhat about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don\'t have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E\'s? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two E\'s, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E\'s? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nHowever, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn\'t have another E. So it\'s possible, but we have no evidence.\n\nBut we can rule out duplicates? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nSo let\'s assume no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try another.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nSo we can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAJER""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". \n\nIf the word is ""CALER"": \n  C A L E R\n  Our guess: C A K E R\n  Feedback: \n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it\'s wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".\n\nBut if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSo I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.\n\nSo the guess is ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CAKER"".\n\n<guess>kaker</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n### Key Insights from Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).\n   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **N** x (not in word).\n   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).\n\n2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **T** x (not in word).\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:\n  - Position 1: **C**\n  - Position 2: **A**\n  - Position 4: **E**\n  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).

We are given feedback for the third guess ""kaker"":
  K: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
  K: x (second K is not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
  R: ✓ (correct position, which we deduced must be position 5)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x's for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.

The feedback for ""kaker"":
  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)

So we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.

So now the absent letters are: N, T, K.

We also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.

We can list possible letters for the third position:
  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).

So available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

Possible words:
  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)
  ""CADER"" -> not a word.
  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E's? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don't know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E's, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know.

But we can check: 
  If the word is ""CAVER"": 
      C A V E R
      First guess ""crane"": 
          C: ✓
          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.

  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.

  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

  So ""CAVER"" is possible.

  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: 
      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.

  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's not there, so the mark is correct.

  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn't test V in any position? So it's possible.

  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.

  First guess: 
      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.
          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, so '-' is correct.

      So first guess feedback is consistent.

      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          A: ✓ (position 2)
          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's wrong -> '-' is correct.
          E: ✓ (position 4)
          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.

  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.

But we have two x's for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn't use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". 

So ""CAVER"" is a candidate.

But we also have other candidates: 
  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.
  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven't used L.
  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.
  ""CADER"": not a word.
  ""CAFER"": not a word.
  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It's 6.
  ""CAMEO"": doesn't fit.

So the common words are: CALER, CAPER.

We can try one of them.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).

But we have multiple candidates: 
  ""CAVER"" (C A V E R)
  ""CALER"" (C A L E R)
  ""CAPER"" (C A P E R)

We can try ""CALER"" first.

But we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not a common word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: ""CAVER"", ""CALER"", ""CAPER"".

We can try ""CALER"" because L is a common letter.

But we have to be careful: we are on the fourth guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that it's one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"".

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it's either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

We can also try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But let me see: we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But we can also try ""CAVER"" to test V? Or ""CAPER"" to test P.

Since we have two possibilities left (if ""CALER"" is wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"" or ""CAVER""), we can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But if we try ""CAPER"" and it's wrong, then we have two options left: ""CAVER"" and ""CALER"". Then we can try one.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.

So let's try ""CAPER"".

But we can also try ""CALER"".

I think ""CALER"" is a common word.

But let me check the feedback for ""CAPER"": 
  If the word is ""CAPER"": 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in position 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  So if we get all ✓, we win.

  If the word is ""CALER"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put P) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then position 3 is L, so we would get P(x) and then we know it's ""CALER"".
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  Similarly, if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get P(x) and then we know to try ""CAVER"".

But we can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not common and we don't know.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

But we have to be cautious: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled that out because R is in position 5 and we know it's not in 3.

Another candidate: ""CADER"" is not a word.

So I think the only common words are ""CALER"", ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"".

We can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CAVER"". 

We can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.

Alternatively, we can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess ""CALER"".

But let me check the dictionary: 
  ""CALER"" is a valid English word (meaning: more frequent or common in a particular place? or a type of fish? but also used in sports).

  ""CAPER"" is also valid (one who caps).

  ""CAVER"" is less common (a cave explorer).

So between ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"", I'll choose ""CALER"" because L is more common than P.

But we have no information about L or P.

So we can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CALER"".

But let me see: if we guess ""CALER"" and it's not the word, then we know the third letter is not L. Then we can try ""CAPER"" next, and if that's not, then ""CAVER"".

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this.

So we can do that.

But we can also try ""CAPER"" first.

I think it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"".

So I'll go with ""CALER"".

After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

3. **Guess 3 (""kaker"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **K** x (not in word).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback: R cannot be in positions 2 or 3, and positions 1, 2, 4 are fixed).
- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** (no duplicates indicated).
  - Cannot be **N**, **T**, or **K** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested.

### Possible Words:
- **CALER** (L in position 3).
- **CAPER** (P in position 3).
- **CAVER** (V in position 3).

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **CALER** is chosen to test **L**:
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **L** will confirm/eliminate it:
    - If **L** is ✓, the word is **CALER**.
    - If **L** is x, then the word is either **CAPER** or **CAVER**.
    - If **L** is -, then it would be in the word but wrong position—but position 3 is the only unknown, so this cannot happen (since it would require **L** to be in the word but not in position 3, but we have no other positions for **L**).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities.

<guess>caler</guess>",caler,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""kaker"":
  K: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
  K: x (second K is not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
  R: ✓ (correct position, which we deduced must be position 5)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x's for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.

The feedback for ""kaker"":
  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)

So we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.

So now the absent letters are: N, T, K.

We also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.

We can list possible letters for the third position:
  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).

So available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

Possible words:
  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)
  ""CADER"" -> not a word.
  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E's? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don't know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E's, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know.

But we can check: 
  If the word is ""CAVER"": 
      C A V E R
      First guess ""crane"": 
          C: ✓
          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.

  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.

  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

  So ""CAVER"" is possible.

  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: 
      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.

  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's not there, so the mark is correct.

  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn't test V in any position? So it's possible.

  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.

  First guess: 
      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.
          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, so '-' is correct.

      So first guess feedback is consistent.

      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          A: ✓ (position 2)
          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's wrong -> '-' is correct.
          E: ✓ (position 4)
          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.

  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.

But we have two x's for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn't use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". 

So ""CAVER"" is a candidate.

But we also have other candidates: 
  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.
  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven't used L.
  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.
  ""CADER"": not a word.
  ""CAFER"": not a word.
  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It's 6.
  ""CAMEO"": doesn't fit.

So the common words are: CALER, CAPER.

We can try one of them.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).

But we have multiple candidates:

We can try ""CALER"" first.

But we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not a common word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

If we guess ""CALER"":

  If not, then we know it's either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.

But let me see: we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.

So let's try ""CAPER"".

But we can also try ""CALER"".

I think ""CALER"" is a common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.

<guess>caret</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).
- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it's not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.

But let's check: 
  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.

But what about position 3? We don't have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.

Therefore, the only position left for R is 5.

So the word is: C, A, ?, E, R

But wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).

So the word is: C A ? E R

Now, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters can be in position 3? 
  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don't have a full list.

We have to consider: what letters are possible? 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.

But the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried.

We don't know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.

So the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.

So the pattern is: C A ? E R

What words fit this pattern?
  We can think of words like: 
    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that's not common.
    ""CAUER"" (not a word)
    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.

Actually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.

Similarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

What about ""CARES""? 
  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it's not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.

Therefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).

So we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).

Possible letters for X: 
  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So X must be a new letter that we haven't tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.

So the available letters: 
  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.

But we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven't used.

We can list the available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)
  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.
  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.
  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A
        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.

  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.

  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).

  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).

  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.

  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).

  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.

  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.

  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).

So the candidates are:
  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R
  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R
  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R
  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So that's consistent.

Similarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it's correct.

And R is in position 5 and we haven't tested that position for R.

So we can try one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.

But we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don't know.

We can try ""CAKER"". If it's not, we get feedback on K.

But we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we can also try a word that doesn't follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""CABER""? Not a word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.

So the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's stick to common words.

We can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.

Another word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

So the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that's not a word and doesn't end with R.

We must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.

So we have to choose one of the candidates.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.

So the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.

Another idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that's not possible.

Similarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.

So we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's assume the common ones.

We can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

So let's guess ""CAKER"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But let me double-check the feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that's consistent.
  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that's consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn't put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.

  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.
  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

Second guess: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that's correct.
  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it's wrong, which is consistent.
  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that's correct.
  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.

So ""CAKER"" is consistent.

Similarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".

But we don't know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.

We can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.

I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don't have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E's? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if the word had two E's, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E's? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn't have another E. So it's possible, but we have no evidence.

But we can rule out duplicates? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

We can try ""CAKER"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

So we can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAJER""? Not a word.

So I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".

But let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". 

If the word is ""CALER"": 
  C A L E R
  Our guess: C A K E R
  Feedback: 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it's wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".

But if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.

So the guess is ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

So let's go with ""CAKER"".

<guess>kaker</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). The only remaining position is 5. Thus, **R = position 5**.
- **Absent letters**: **N** and **T** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **R** (known from feedback).
  - Cannot be **N** or **T** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested (and not **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** for now, given no duplicates indicated).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must be **C A _ E R**.
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **CAKER**, **CALER**, **CAPER**, **CAVER**.
- **CAKER** is chosen to test **K** in position 3:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **K** will confirm/eliminate it, narrowing options to **CALER**/**CAPER** for subsequent guesses.

<guess>kaker</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: kaker -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the third guess ""kaker"":
  K: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
  K: x (second K is not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
  R: ✓ (correct position, which we deduced must be position 5)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x's for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.

The feedback for ""kaker"":
  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)

So we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.

So now the absent letters are: N, T, K.

We also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.

We can list possible letters for the third position:
  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).

So available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

Possible words:
  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)
  ""CADER"" -> not a word.
  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E's? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don't know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E's, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know.

But we can check: 
  If the word is ""CAVER"": 
      C A V E R
      First guess ""crane"": 
          C: ✓
          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.

  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.

  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

  So ""CAVER"" is possible.

  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: 
      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.

  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's not there, so the mark is correct.

  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn't test V in any position? So it's possible.

  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.

  First guess: 
      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.
          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, so '-' is correct.

      So first guess feedback is consistent.

      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          A: ✓ (position 2)
          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's wrong -> '-' is correct.
          E: ✓ (position 4)
          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.

  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.

But we have two x's for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn't use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". 

So ""CAVER"" is a candidate.

But we also have other candidates: 
  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.
  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven't used L.
  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.
  ""CADER"": not a word.
  ""CAFER"": not a word.
  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It's 6.
  ""CAMEO"": doesn't fit.

So the common words are: CALER, CAPER.

We can try one of them.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).

But we have multiple candidates: 
  ""CAVER"" (C A V E R)
  ""CALER"" (C A L E R)
  ""CAPER"" (C A P E R)

We can try ""CALER"" first.

But we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not a common word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: ""CAVER"", ""CALER"", ""CAPER"".

We can try ""CALER"" because L is a common letter.

But we have to be careful: we are on the fourth guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that it's one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"".

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it's either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

We can also try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But let me see: we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But we can also try ""CAVER"" to test V? Or ""CAPER"" to test P.

Since we have two possibilities left (if ""CALER"" is wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"" or ""CAVER""), we can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But if we try ""CAPER"" and it's wrong, then we have two options left: ""CAVER"" and ""CALER"". Then we can try one.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.

So let's try ""CAPER"".

But we can also try ""CALER"".

I think ""CALER"" is a common word.

But let me check the feedback for ""CAPER"": 
  If the word is ""CAPER"": 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in position 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  So if we get all ✓, we win.

  If the word is ""CALER"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put P) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then position 3 is L, so we would get P(x) and then we know it's ""CALER"".
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  Similarly, if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get P(x) and then we know to try ""CAVER"".

But we can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not common and we don't know.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

But we have to be cautious: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled that out because R is in position 5 and we know it's not in 3.

Another candidate: ""CADER"" is not a word.

So I think the only common words are ""CALER"", ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"".

We can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CAVER"". 

We can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.

Alternatively, we can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess ""CALER"".

But let me check the dictionary: 
  ""CALER"" is a valid English word (meaning: more frequent or common in a particular place? or a type of fish? but also used in sports).

  ""CAPER"" is also valid (one who caps).

  ""CAVER"" is less common (a cave explorer).

So between ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"", I'll choose ""CALER"" because L is more common than P.

But we have no information about L or P.

So we can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CALER"".

But let me see: if we guess ""CALER"" and it's not the word, then we know the third letter is not L. Then we can try ""CAPER"" next, and if that's not, then ""CAVER"".

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this.

So we can do that.

But we can also try ""CAPER"" first.

I think it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"".

So I'll go with ""CALER"".

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

3. **Guess 3 (""kaker"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **K** x (not in word).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback: R cannot be in positions 2 or 3, and positions 1, 2, 4 are fixed).
- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** (no duplicates indicated).
  - Cannot be **N**, **T**, or **K** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested.

### Possible Words:
- **CALER** (L in position 3).
- **CAPER** (P in position 3).
- **CAVER** (V in position 3).

### Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **CALER** is chosen to test **L**:
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **L** will confirm/eliminate it:
    - If **L** is ✓, the word is **CALER**.
    - If **L** is x, then the word is either **CAPER** or **CAVER**.
    - If **L** is -, then it would be in the word but wrong position—but position 3 is the only unknown, so this cannot happen (since it would require **L** to be in the word but not in position 3, but we have no other positions for **L**).

So the secret word starts with C.\n - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).\n - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.\n - The letter N is not in the word.\n - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n Also, note that the word does not contain N.\n\n Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _\n\n We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.\n\n We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.\n\n Let\'s think of possible positions for R, A, E.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.\n\n We must avoid using N.\n\n We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.\n\n However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.\n\n We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n   - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list the positions: \n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don\'t have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.\n\n However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.\n\n But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).\n\n So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven\'t discovered yet.\n\n We don\'t know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don\'t have any other known absent letters).\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N.\n\n We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).\n Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).\n E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _\n\n But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:\n   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.\n   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _\n\n But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.\n\n However, we must check if that fits the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _\n\n But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). \n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   ""CAREX"" - but that\'s not a common word? And we don\'t know if it\'s valid.\n   ""CARLE"" - not a word.\n   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET""? \n   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:\n     Position 1: C -> correct.\n     Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. \n     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.\n     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.\n     Position 5: T -> new letter.\n\n But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.\n\n In the first guess, we had:\n   C R A N E\n   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n\n Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:\n   C: ✓ (correct)\n   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   N: not in the word -> consistent.\n   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.\n\n But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don\'t have feedback for the second guess. So we can\'t be sure.\n\n But let\'s see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.\n\n We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).\n\n Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).\n\n Some words:\n   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T\n   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.\n\n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.\n\n   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.\n\n But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:\n   In ""CATER"": \n      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.\n      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: \n   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that\'s a new position, so that\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are testing T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.\n\n Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? \n\n But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don\'t know about T, S, D, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that\'s not common) or ""CRATE"".\n\n However, ""CRATE"": \n   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""CARET"": \n   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).\n\n But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\n However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).\n\n So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait, what about the letter T? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word. We are testing it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used (like S) and also tests the positions.\n\n How about ""CARES""? \n   C A R E S -> positions: \n      1: C\n      2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2 before? We only know it\'s not in 3)\n      3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know it\'s not in 2)\n      4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know it\'s not in 5)\n      5: S (new)\n\n This word is valid.\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that\'s safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).\n\n So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.\n\n But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.\n\n We don\'t know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about T and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used and also rearranges the known letters.\n\n But we have to start with C.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? \n   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn\'t have R.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s stick with words that have all three.\n\n We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.\n\n How about ""CARED""? \n   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.\n\n However, we have to choose one.\n\n Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.\n\n But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.\n\n So let\'s guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.\n\n However, we are allowed to test new positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn\'t have A.\n\n We must have A, R, E.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""CARET"": \n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we don\'t know if it\'s correct, but we are testing)\n      Position 3: R (testing)\n      Position 4: E (testing)\n      Position 5: T (testing)\n\n If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.\n\n But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a \'-\' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a \'-\' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.\n\n But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)\n   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)\n\n But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.\n\n But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it\'s not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".\n\n But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.\n\n For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn\'t start with C.\n\n We must start with C.\n\n How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.\n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CARES""? That\'s valid.\n\n But let me see: we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _\n\n But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? \n   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.\n\n Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\n So it\'s hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? \n\n Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _\n\n But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? \n   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ \n   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.\n\n So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.\n\n After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I will go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about ""CARES""? It\'s also a valid word. Let me check: \n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: \n        1: C\n        2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)\n        3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)\n        4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)\n        5: S (new)\n\n This is also a valid word.\n\n But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about S or T.\n\n Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I\'ll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""CARET""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:\n   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _\n\n Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. \n\n Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.\n\n How about ""CESAR""? But that\'s not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? \n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.\n\n How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don\'t know about D.\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don\'t know which one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.\n\n But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.\n\n However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.\n\n For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don\'t know.\n\n After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I\'ll go with that.\n\n Guess: ""CARET""\n\n<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- **N** is not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).\n3. **N** is absent.\n4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:\n- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).\n- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).\n- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).\n- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).\n- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.\n- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.\n\n<guess>caret</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again\n  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it\'s marked as wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).\n- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).\n- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it\'s not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? \n\nBut wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.\n\nBut let\'s check: \n  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.\n\nBut what about position 3? We don\'t have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a \'-\' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.\n\nTherefore, the only position left for R is 5.\n\nSo the word is: C, A, ?, E, R\n\nBut wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).\n\nSo the word is: C A ? E R\n\nNow, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWhat letters can be in position 3? \n  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don\'t have a full list.\n\nWe have to consider: what letters are possible? \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.\n\nBut the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe don\'t know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.\n\nSo the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.\n\nSo the pattern is: C A ? E R\n\nWhat words fit this pattern?\n  We can think of words like: \n    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that\'s not common.\n    ""CAUER"" (not a word)\n    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.\n\nActually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nWhat about ""CARES""? \n  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it\'s not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\nBut wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.\n\nTherefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).\n\nSo we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don\'t know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).\n\nPossible letters for X: \n  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo X must be a new letter that we haven\'t tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.\n\nSo the available letters: \n  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.\n\nBut we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven\'t used.\n\nWe can list the available letters: \n  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to choose a word that is common.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)\n  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.\n  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.\n  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": \n        Position 1: C\n        Position 2: A\n        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.\n\n  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.\n\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).\n\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).\n\n  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.\n\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).\n\n  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.\n\n  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.\n\n  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).\n\nSo the candidates are:\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R\n  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it\'s correct. So that\'s consistent.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct.\n\nAnd R is in position 5 and we haven\'t tested that position for R.\n\nSo we can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.\n\nBut we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"". If it\'s not, we get feedback on K.\n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.\n\nBut let me think: are there other words?\n\nWhat about ""CABER""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""CAYER""? Not a word.\n\nSo the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.\n\nSo the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nWe can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.\n\nAnother word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nSo the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that\'s not a word and doesn\'t end with R.\n\nWe must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.\n\nSo we have to choose one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.\n\nSo the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.\n\nAnother idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that\'s not possible.\n\nSimilarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.\n\nSo we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s assume the common ones.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that\'s consistent.\n  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that\'s consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn\'t put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.\n\n  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.\n  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nSecond guess: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that\'s correct.\n  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it\'s wrong, which is consistent.\n  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that\'s correct.\n  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.\n\nSo ""CAKER"" is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".\n\nBut we don\'t know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also try a word that doesn\'t use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.\n\nI think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nWhat about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don\'t have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E\'s? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two E\'s, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E\'s? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nHowever, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn\'t have another E. So it\'s possible, but we have no evidence.\n\nBut we can rule out duplicates? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nSo let\'s assume no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try another.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nSo we can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAJER""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". \n\nIf the word is ""CALER"": \n  C A L E R\n  Our guess: C A K E R\n  Feedback: \n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it\'s wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".\n\nBut if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSo I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.\n\nSo the guess is ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""CAKER"".\n\n<guess>kaker</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n### Key Insights from Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).\n   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **N** x (not in word).\n   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).\n\n2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **T** x (not in word).\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:\n  - Position 1: **C**\n  - Position 2: **A**\n  - Position 4: **E**\n  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback).

E R, with the third letter missing.\n- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x\'s for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.\n\nThe feedback for ""kaker"":\n  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)\n  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)\n  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)\n  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)\n  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)\n\nSo we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.\n\nSo now the absent letters are: N, T, K.\n\nWe also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.\n\nWe can list possible letters for the third position:\n  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).\n\nSo available letters: \n  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)\n  ""CADER"" -> not a word.\n  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E\'s? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E\'s, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nBut we can check: \n  If the word is ""CAVER"": \n      C A V E R\n      First guess ""crane"": \n          C: ✓\n          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.\n\n  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.\n\n  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\n  So ""CAVER"" is possible.\n\n  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: \n      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.\n\n  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it\'s not there, so the mark is correct.\n\n  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn\'t test V in any position? So it\'s possible.\n\n  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.\n\n  First guess: \n      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":\n          C: ✓\n          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it\'s wrong, so the \'-\' is correct.\n          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it\'s wrong, so the \'-\' is correct.\n          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.\n          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it\'s wrong, so \'-\' is correct.\n\n      So first guess feedback is consistent.\n\n      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":\n          C: ✓\n          A: ✓ (position 2)\n          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it\'s wrong -> \'-\' is correct.\n          E: ✓ (position 4)\n          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.\n\n  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.\n\nBut we have two x\'s for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn\'t use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". \n\nSo ""CAVER"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have other candidates: \n  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.\n  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven\'t used L.\n  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.\n  ""CADER"": not a word.\n  ""CAFER"": not a word.\n  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It\'s 6.\n  ""CAMEO"": doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo the common words are: CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try one of them.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nIf we guess ""CALER"":\n  If it\'s correct, we win.\n  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).\n\nBut we have multiple candidates: \n  ""CAVER"" (C A V E R)\n  ""CALER"" (C A L E R)\n  ""CAPER"" (C A P E R)\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" first.\n\nBut we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it\'s not a common word.\n\nOr ""CAYER""? Not a word.\n\nSo we have three strong candidates: ""CAVER"", ""CALER"", ""CAPER"".\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" because L is a common letter.\n\nBut we have to be careful: we are on the fourth guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t use the pattern? But we are almost sure that it\'s one of these.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"".\n\nIf we guess ""CALER"":\n  If it\'s correct, we win.\n  If not, then we know it\'s either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut let me see: we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nBut we can also try ""CAVER"" to test V? Or ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nSince we have two possibilities left (if ""CALER"" is wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"" or ""CAVER""), we can try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut if we try ""CAPER"" and it\'s wrong, then we have two options left: ""CAVER"" and ""CALER"". Then we can try one.\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nSo let\'s try ""CAPER"".\n\nBut we can also try ""CALER"".\n\nI think ""CALER"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check the feedback for ""CAPER"": \n  If the word is ""CAPER"": \n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in position 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓\n      R: ✓\n\n  So if we get all ✓, we win.\n\n  If the word is ""CALER"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      P: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put P) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then position 3 is L, so we would get P(x) and then we know it\'s ""CALER"".\n      E: ✓\n      R: ✓\n\n  Similarly, if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get P(x) and then we know to try ""CAVER"".\n\nBut we can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it\'s not common and we don\'t know.\n\nSo I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled that out because R is in position 5 and we know it\'s not in 3.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CADER"" is not a word.\n\nSo I think the only common words are ""CALER"", ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"".\n\nWe can try ""CALER"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CAVER"". \n\nWe can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSo I think we should guess ""CALER"".\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: \n  ""CALER"" is a valid English word (meaning: more frequent or common in a particular place? or a type of fish? but also used in sports).\n\n  ""CAPER"" is also valid (one who caps).\n\n  ""CAVER"" is less common (a cave explorer).\n\nSo between ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"", I\'ll choose ""CALER"" because L is more common than P.\n\nBut we have no information about L or P.\n\nSo we can try ""CALER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.\n\nSo I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""CALER"".\n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""CALER"" and it\'s not the word, then we know the third letter is not L. Then we can try ""CAPER"" next, and if that\'s not, then ""CAVER"".\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try ""CAPER"" first.\n\nI think it doesn\'t matter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CALER"".\n\n<guess>caler</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n### Key Insights from Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).\n   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **N** x (not in word).\n   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).\n\n2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **T** x (not in word).\n\n3. **Guess 3 (""kaker"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **K** x (not in word).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:\n  - Position 1: **C**\n  - Position 2: **A**\n  - Position 4: **E**\n  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback: R cannot be in positions 2 or 3, and positions 1, 2, 4 are fixed).\n- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K** (from feedback).\n- **Word structure**: **C A ?

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""caler"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  R: ✓ (correct position)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter is not L (and also not N, T, K, because we have already ruled them out).

We still have two main candidates: ""CAPER"" (P in position 3) and ""CAVER"" (V in position 3).

We can try ""CAPER"" next.

But note: we have to be cautious. There might be other words? For example, ""CABER"" (but it's not common and we don't know) or ""CADER"" (not a word). 

We can also consider ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"".

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

If we guess ""CAPER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAVER"" (because ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"" are the only two remaining common words).

So we can do that.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess.

We can also try ""CAVER"" to test V.

But we don't have any information about P or V.

So we can try ""CAPER"".

If we guess ""CAPER"":
  Feedback:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  If it's correct, we win.

  If not, then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: x (if the word is ""CAVER"", then P is absent -> x)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  Then we know the word must be ""CAVER"" (because it's the only other common word).

Similarly, if we guess ""CAVER"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"".

So we can choose either.

But we have two possibilities. We can try ""CAPER"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to both? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CAPER"".

So I'll go with ""CAPER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CABER"" or other words. But we are not considering them because they are not common.

So the only two common words are ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"".

Therefore, we guess ""CAPER"".

But let me check: 
  In the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAPER"", A is in position 2 and it's correct. In ""CAVER"", A is also in position 2. So both have A in 2.

Similarly, E is in 4 in both.

R is in 5 in both.

So the only difference is the third letter: P in ""CAPER"" and V in ""CAVER"".

We can try ""CAPER"".

If it's not, then we try ""CAVER"".

But we have 2 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, so we have 1 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more (guesses 5 and 6) to try one of them.

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.

Alternatively, we can try ""CAPER"".

So I'll go with ""CAPER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.
 - The letter N is not in the word.
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the word does not contain N.

 Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _

 We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.

 We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

 Let's think of possible positions for R, A, E.

 Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.

 We must avoid using N.

 We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.

 However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.

 We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - E cannot be in position 5.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's list the positions: 
   Position 1: C (fixed)
   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don't have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.

 However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.

 But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).

 So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

 We don't know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don't have any other known absent letters).

 We also know that the word does not contain N.

 We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.

 Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).
 Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).
 E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).

 However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to form a word:

 We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _

 But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:
   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.
   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3).

 But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _

 But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.

 However, we must check if that fits the feedback.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _

 But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). 

 Let's try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.

 Some possibilities: 
   ""CAREX"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if it's valid.
   ""CARLE"" - not a word.
   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters.

 How about ""CARET""? 
   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:
     Position 1: C -> correct.
     Position 2: A -> we don't know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. 
     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.
     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.
     Position 5: T -> new letter.

 But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.

 In the first guess, we had:
   C R A N E
   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)

 Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:
   C: ✓ (correct)
   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that's consistent.
   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that's consistent.
   N: not in the word -> consistent.
   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.

 But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don't have feedback for the second guess. So we can't be sure.

 But let's see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don't know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.

 We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).

 Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).

 Some words:
   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T
   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.

   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we haven't tested S.

   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.

   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.

 But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:
   In ""CATER"": 
      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.
      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that's acceptable.

 However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: 
   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that's a new position, so that's allowed.

 But note: we don't know if T is in the word. We are testing T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.

 Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.

 How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? 

 But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don't know about T, S, D, etc.

 We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that's not common) or ""CRATE"".

 However, ""CRATE"": 
   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.

 Similarly, ""CARET"": 
   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).

 But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

 However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).

 So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the letter T? We don't know if it's in the word. We are testing it.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used (like S) and also tests the positions.

 How about ""CARES""? 
   C A R E S -> positions: 
      1: C
      2: A (we haven't tested A in 2 before? We only know it's not in 3)
      3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know it's not in 2)
      4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know it's not in 5)
      5: S (new)

 This word is valid.

 But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that's safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).

 So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.

 However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.

 But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.

 We don't know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about T and S.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't used and also rearranges the known letters.

 But we have to start with C.

 Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.

 How about ""CABLE""? 
   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn't have R.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's stick with words that have all three.

 We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.

 How about ""CARED""? 
   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.

 But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.

 But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.

 However, we have to choose one.

 Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.

 But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".

 But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.

 So let's go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.

 So let's guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.

 However, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn't have A.

 We must have A, R, E.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.

 But let me check: 
   In ""CARET"": 
      Position 1: C (correct)
      Position 2: A (we don't know if it's correct, but we are testing)
      Position 3: R (testing)
      Position 4: E (testing)
      Position 5: T (testing)

 If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.

 But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a '-' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a '-' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? 

 However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.

 But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)
   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)

 But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.

 But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it's not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".

 But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.

 For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn't start with C.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.

 How about ""CARES""? That's valid.

 But let me see: we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _

 But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? 
   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.

 Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.

 How about ""CERES""? Not common.

 So it's hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? 

 Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _

 But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? 
   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ 
   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.

 So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.

 We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven't tested and also tests a new letter.

 But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.

 After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I will go with ""CARET"".

 But wait, what about ""CARES""? It's also a valid word. Let me check: 
   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: 
        1: C
        2: A (we haven't tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)
        3: R (we haven't tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)
        4: E (we haven't tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)
        5: S (new)

 This is also a valid word.

 But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.

 Which one to choose? 

 We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don't have information about S or T.

 Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I'll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""CARET""

 But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:
   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don't know if D is in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _

 Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. 

 Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.

 How about ""CESAR""? But that's not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? 

 Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.

 How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.

 So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".

 But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)

 Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.

 Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:
   C: ✓
   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)
   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)
   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)
   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don't know about D.

 Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don't know which one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.

 Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.

 But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.

 For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don't know.

 After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with that.

 Guess: ""CARET""

<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- **N** is not in the word (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).
3. **N** is absent.
4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.

For the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:
- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).
- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).
- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).
- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).
- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.
- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.

This guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.

<guess>caret</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again
  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2
  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it's marked as wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4
  T: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).
- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it's not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
We know:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: A
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.

But let's check: 
  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. 
  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.

But what about position 3? We don't have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a '-' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.

Therefore, the only position left for R is 5.

So the word is: C, A, ?, E, R

But wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).

So the word is: C A ? E R

Now, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

What letters can be in position 3? 
  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don't have a full list.

We have to consider: what letters are possible? 
  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.

But the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven't tried.

We don't know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.

So the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.

So the pattern is: C A ? E R

What words fit this pattern?
  We can think of words like: 
    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that's not common.
    ""CAUER"" (not a word)
    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.

Actually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.

Similarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

What about ""CARES""? 
  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven't placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it's not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.

Therefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).

So we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don't know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).

Possible letters for X: 
  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So X must be a new letter that we haven't tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.

We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.

So the available letters: 
  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.

But we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven't used.

We can list the available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to choose a word that is common.

Possible words:
  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)
  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.
  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.
  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": 
        Position 1: C
        Position 2: A
        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.

  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.

  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).

  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).

  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.

  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).

  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.

  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.

  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).

So the candidates are:
  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R
  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R
  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R
  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it's correct. So that's consistent.

Similarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it's correct.

And R is in position 5 and we haven't tested that position for R.

So we can try one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven't tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.

But we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don't know.

We can try ""CAKER"". If it's not, we get feedback on K.

But we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.

But we can also try a word that doesn't follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.

But let me think: are there other words?

What about ""CABER""? Not a word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.

So the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's stick to common words.

We can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.

Another word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.

So the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that's not a word and doesn't end with R.

We must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.

So we have to choose one of the candidates.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.

So the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.

We can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.

But we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.

Another idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that's not possible.

Similarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.

So we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

But CAVER is not common. Let's assume the common ones.

We can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.

So let's guess ""CAKER"".

But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So no.

Therefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But let me double-check the feedback:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that's consistent.
  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that's consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn't put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.

  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.
  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

Second guess: ""caret""
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that's correct.
  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it's wrong, which is consistent.
  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that's correct.
  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.

So ""CAKER"" is consistent.

Similarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".

But we don't know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.

We can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.

I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don't have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E's? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it's correct. So if the word had two E's, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E's? But we don't have evidence.

However, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it's correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn't have another E. So it's possible, but we have no evidence.

But we can rule out duplicates? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So let's assume no duplicates.

Therefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.

We can try ""CAKER"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

So we can try ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that's not a word.

Or ""CAJER""? Not a word.

So I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".

But let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". 

If the word is ""CALER"": 
  C A L E R
  Our guess: C A K E R
  Feedback: 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it's wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.

Similarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".

But if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.

So the guess is ""CAKER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate? But we have no evidence.

So let's go with ""CAKER"".

<guess>kaker</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

### Key Insights from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).
   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **N** x (not in word).
   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - **R** must be in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from feedback). The only remaining position is 5. Thus, **R = position 5**.
- **Absent letters**: **N** and **T** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **R** (known from feedback).
  - Cannot be **N** or **T** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested (and not **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** for now, given no duplicates indicated).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- The word must be **C A _ E R**.
- Common English words fitting this pattern: **CAKER**, **CALER**, **CAPER**, **CAVER**.
- **CAKER** is chosen to test **K** in position 3:
  - If correct, we solve the puzzle.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **K** will confirm/eliminate it, narrowing options to **CALER**/**CAPER** for subsequent guesses.

<guess>kaker</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: kaker -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the third guess ""kaker"":
  K: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew from guess 2)
  K: x (second K is not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)
  R: ✓ (correct position, which we deduced must be position 5)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x's for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.

The feedback for ""kaker"":
  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)
  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)
  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)

So we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.

So now the absent letters are: N, T, K.

We also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.

We can list possible letters for the third position:
  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).

So available letters: 
  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

Possible words:
  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)
  ""CADER"" -> not a word.
  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E's? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don't know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E's, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn't know.

But we can check: 
  If the word is ""CAVER"": 
      C A V E R
      First guess ""crane"": 
          C: ✓
          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.

  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.

  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that's consistent.

  So ""CAVER"" is possible.

  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: 
      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.

  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's not there, so the mark is correct.

  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn't test V in any position? So it's possible.

  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.

  First guess: 
      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, so the '-' is correct.
          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.
          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, so '-' is correct.

      So first guess feedback is consistent.

      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":
          C: ✓
          A: ✓ (position 2)
          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it's wrong -> '-' is correct.
          E: ✓ (position 4)
          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.

  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.

But we have two x's for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn't use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". 

So ""CAVER"" is a candidate.

But we also have other candidates: 
  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.
  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven't used L.
  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.
  ""CADER"": not a word.
  ""CAFER"": not a word.
  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It's 6.
  ""CAMEO"": doesn't fit.

So the common words are: CALER, CAPER.

We can try one of them.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).

But we have multiple candidates: 
  ""CAVER"" (C A V E R)
  ""CALER"" (C A L E R)
  ""CAPER"" (C A P E R)

We can try ""CALER"" first.

But we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not a common word.

Or ""CAYER""? Not a word.

So we have three strong candidates: ""CAVER"", ""CALER"", ""CAPER"".

We can try ""CALER"" because L is a common letter.

But we have to be careful: we are on the fourth guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that doesn't use the pattern? But we are almost sure that it's one of these.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"".

If we guess ""CALER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it's either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.

We can also try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But let me see: we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"" to test L.

But we can also try ""CAVER"" to test V? Or ""CAPER"" to test P.

Since we have two possibilities left (if ""CALER"" is wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"" or ""CAVER""), we can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

But if we try ""CAPER"" and it's wrong, then we have two options left: ""CAVER"" and ""CALER"". Then we can try one.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.

So let's try ""CAPER"".

But we can also try ""CALER"".

I think ""CALER"" is a common word.

But let me check the feedback for ""CAPER"": 
  If the word is ""CAPER"": 
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in position 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  So if we get all ✓, we win.

  If the word is ""CALER"", then we would get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put P) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then position 3 is L, so we would get P(x) and then we know it's ""CALER"".
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  Similarly, if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get P(x) and then we know to try ""CAVER"".

But we can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it's not common and we don't know.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

But we have to be cautious: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled that out because R is in position 5 and we know it's not in 3.

Another candidate: ""CADER"" is not a word.

So I think the only common words are ""CALER"", ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"".

We can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CAVER"". 

We can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.

Alternatively, we can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn't fit the pattern.

So I think we should guess ""CALER"".

But let me check the dictionary: 
  ""CALER"" is a valid English word (meaning: more frequent or common in a particular place? or a type of fish? but also used in sports).

  ""CAPER"" is also valid (one who caps).

  ""CAVER"" is less common (a cave explorer).

So between ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"", I'll choose ""CALER"" because L is more common than P.

But we have no information about L or P.

So we can try ""CALER"".

But note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn't have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.

So I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""CALER"".

But let me see: if we guess ""CALER"" and it's not the word, then we know the third letter is not L. Then we can try ""CAPER"" next, and if that's not, then ""CAVER"".

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this.

So we can do that.

But we can also try ""CAPER"" first.

I think it doesn't matter.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.

We can try ""CALER"".

So I'll go with ""CALER"".

  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect, feedback on **L** will confirm/eliminate it:
    - If **L** is ✓, the word is **CALER**.
    - If **L** is x, then the word is either **CAPER** or **CAVER**.
    - If **L** is -, then it would be in the word but wrong position—but position 3 is the only unknown, so this cannot happen (since it would require **L** to be in the word but not in position 3, but we have no other positions for **L**).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: kaker -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: caler -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""caler"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  L: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  R: ✓ (correct position)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter is not L (and also not N, T, K, because we have already ruled them out).

We still have two main candidates: ""CAPER"" (P in position 3) and ""CAVER"" (V in position 3).

We can try ""CAPER"" next.

But note: we have to be cautious. There might be other words? For example, ""CABER"" (but it's not common and we don't know) or ""CADER"" (not a word). 

We can also consider ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"".

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CAPER"" to test P.

If we guess ""CAPER"":
  If it's correct, we win.
  If not, then we know it must be ""CAVER"" (because ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"" are the only two remaining common words).

So we can do that.

But we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess.

We can also try ""CAVER"" to test V.

But we don't have any information about P or V.

So we can try ""CAPER"".

If we guess ""CAPER"":
  Feedback:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in 3 -> ✓)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  If it's correct, we win.

  If not, then we get:
      C: ✓
      A: ✓
      P: x (if the word is ""CAVER"", then P is absent -> x)
      E: ✓
      R: ✓

  Then we know the word must be ""CAVER"" (because it's the only other common word).

Similarly, if we guess ""CAVER"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"".

So we can choose either.

But we have two possibilities. We can try ""CAPER"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to both? But we don't have a set.

We can try ""CAPER"".

So I'll go with ""CAPER"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CABER"" or other words. But we are not considering them because they are not common.

So the only two common words are ""CAPER"" and ""CAVER"".

Therefore, we guess ""CAPER"".

But let me check: 
  In the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAPER"", A is in position 2 and it's correct. In ""CAVER"", A is also in position 2. So both have A in 2.

Similarly, E is in 4 in both.

R is in 5 in both.

So the only difference is the third letter: P in ""CAPER"" and V in ""CAVER"".

We can try ""CAPER"".

If it's not, then we try ""CAVER"".

But we have 2 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, so we have 1 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more (guesses 5 and 6) to try one of them.

So we can do that.

But we can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.

Alternatively, we can try ""CAPER"".

So I'll go with ""CAPER"".

   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).

2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **T** x (not in word).

3. **Guess 3 (""kaker"")**:
   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **K** x (not in word).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).

   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).
   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).
   - **L** x (not in word).
   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).
   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 1: **C**
  - Position 2: **A**
  - Position 4: **E**
  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback).
- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K**, **L** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** (no duplicates indicated).
  - Cannot be **N**, **T**, **K**, or **L** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested.

### Remaining Possibilities:
- **CAPER** (P in position 3).
- **CAVER** (V in position 3).

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Only two candidates remain: **CAPER** and **CAVER**.
- **CAPER** is chosen to test **P**:
  - If correct, the puzzle is solved.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **CAVER** (since **CAPER** would imply **P** is present, but if **P** is absent, then **CAVER** is the answer).

This guess will resolve the puzzle immediately.

So the secret word starts with C.\n - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).\n - The letter A is in the word, but not in the third position.\n - The letter N is not in the word.\n - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.\n\n Also, note that the word does not contain N.\n\n Since the first letter is C, we can write: C _ _ _ _\n\n We know the word contains R, A, E (but not in the positions we guessed) and does not contain N.\n\n We also know that R is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.\n\n Let\'s think of possible positions for R, A, E.\n\n Since the word is 5 letters and starts with C, we can try to form a word that fits.\n\n We must avoid using N.\n\n We can also consider common letters and try to use a word that tests other common letters to get more information.\n\n However, we have three letters that we know are in the word (R, A, E) and one that is not (N). But note that we have only 5 letters and we know C is fixed at the start.\n\n We have to place R, A, E in the remaining four positions, but with constraints:\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n   - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s list the positions: \n   Position 1: C (fixed)\n   Position 2: cannot be R (because we had R in position 2 and it was wrong) and also cannot be A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in position 2 yet. But we know A is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in position 2? However, we don\'t have any constraint against A in position 2. Similarly, R cannot be in position 2, but it could be in 1,3,4,5? But position 1 is taken by C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5? But wait, we have to consider that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so it could be in 2,4,5? But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong.\n\n However, we must also note that the feedback for E was that it is in the word but not in position 5, so E can be in 2,3,4? But wait, we have to avoid the known wrong positions.\n\n But note: we have three letters (R, A, E) that we know are in the word, and we have one more letter to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have C and then three others). Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but we assume no duplicates for now (unless we have evidence otherwise).\n\n So, the word has: C (at position 1), R (somewhere else), A (somewhere else), E (somewhere else), and one more letter that we haven\'t discovered yet.\n\n We don\'t know what that extra letter is. We have to guess a word that includes R, A, E and one new letter (that is not N and not any of the ones we already know are absent? But we don\'t have any other known absent letters).\n\n We also know that the word does not contain N.\n\n We can try to form a word that starts with C and has R, A, E in positions that are allowed.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n We can also consider that we have three known letters and one unknown. So we want to test a new letter.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions that we know are wrong for R, A, E.\n\n Possible positions for R: 3,4,5 (because it cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken by C).\n Similarly, A can be in 2,4,5 (but not 3).\n E can be in 2,3,4 (but not 5).\n\n However, we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word:\n\n We can try putting A in position 2? Then we have: C A _ _ _\n\n But then we have to place R and E in positions 3,4,5, but with constraints:\n   R: cannot be in 2 (which is already taken by A) and cannot be in 2 (which we already know) so 3,4,5.\n   A is in 2, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n But wait, we also have to place E. E can be in 3,4,5? But if we put A in 2, then we can put E in 3? Then we have: C A E _ _\n\n But then we need to put R in 4 or 5? And the last letter is the new one.\n\n However, we must check if that fits the feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 3? Then we have: C _ R _ _\n\n But then we have to place A and E. A can be in 2,4,5. E can be in 2,3,4 (but 3 is taken by R, so 2 or 4). \n\n Let\'s try to think of words that start with C and have R, A, E.\n\n Some possibilities: \n   ""CAREX"" - but that\'s not a common word? And we don\'t know if it\'s valid.\n   ""CARLE"" - not a word.\n   ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n We need 5 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET""? \n   C A R E T -> but we have to check the positions:\n     Position 1: C -> correct.\n     Position 2: A -> we don\'t know if A can be in 2? The feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 3. It could be in 2. \n     Position 3: R -> but we had R in position 2 in the first guess and it was wrong, but now we are putting R in 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t have any constraint that R cannot be in 3.\n     Position 4: E -> but we had E in position 5 and it was wrong, but now we are putting E in 4. Is that allowed? Yes.\n     Position 5: T -> new letter.\n\n But wait, we have to check if the feedback for R, A, E in this word would be consistent with the first guess.\n\n In the first guess, we had:\n   C R A N E\n   Feedback: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n\n Now, if the word is ""CARET"", then:\n   C: ✓ (correct)\n   R: in the word but not in position 2 -> in ""CARET"", R is in position 3 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   A: in the word but not in position 3 -> in ""CARET"", A is in position 2 -> so that\'s consistent.\n   N: not in the word -> consistent.\n   E: in the word but not in position 5 -> in ""CARET"", E is in position 4 -> consistent.\n\n But note: we have to check if the feedback for the first guess was fully satisfied. However, we don\'t have feedback for the second guess. So we can\'t be sure.\n\n But let\'s see: we are going to guess ""CARET"" and then get feedback. If the word is ""CARET"", we win. But if not, we get feedback on T and also on the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and tests multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n Another idea: we can try a word that uses the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But note: we have fixed the first letter as C. We know that the second letter is not R (from the first guess) and not A? Actually, we don\'t know about A in the second position. We only know that A is not in the third.\n\n We can try to use a word that has A in a new position (like 2) and E in a new position (like 4) and R in a new position (like 3 or 4 or 5). But we have to avoid the known absent letters (N).\n\n Let me try to list words that start with C and have R, A, E and one more letter (not N).\n\n Some words:\n   ""CARET"" (as above) -> C A R E T\n   ""CRAVE"" -> C R A V E -> but wait, we have R in position 2? But we know that R cannot be in position 2 (because in the first guess we had R in 2 and it was marked as wrong position). So if we put R in 2, then we are violating the feedback? Actually, the feedback said that R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRAVE"" is invalid because it puts R in 2.\n\n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> but we have R in 3 and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. Is that allowed? Yes. But we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we haven\'t tested S.\n\n   ""CARED"" -> C A R E D -> similar.\n\n   ""CATER"" -> C A T E R -> but then we have R at the end (position 5) and E in 4. But note: we have A in 2. This word has R in 5 and E in 4. Also, T is new.\n\n But wait, we have to check the positions for R and E:\n   In ""CATER"": \n      C:1, A:2, T:3, E:4, R:5.\n      First guess: we had R in 2 (which was wrong) and E in 5 (which was wrong). Now we are putting R in 5 (which is new) and E in 4 (which is new). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n However, we also have to consider the feedback for the first guess: \n   We had A in position 3 (which was wrong). In ""CATER"", A is in position 2 -> that\'s a new position, so that\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if T is in the word. We are testing T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried (like S, T, D, etc.) and also tests the positions.\n\n Another common word: ""CARLE"" is not valid. ""CARE"" is 4 letters.\n\n How about ""CARET"" and ""CARES""? \n\n But let me think: we have to avoid using letters that we know are absent. We know N is absent. We don\'t know about T, S, D, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""CRAPE"" (but that\'s not common) or ""CRATE"".\n\n However, ""CRATE"": \n   C R A T E -> but then we put R in position 2? That is exactly the position we know is wrong for R! So we cannot put R in position 2. Therefore, ""CRATE"" is invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""CARET"": \n   C A R E T -> R is in position 3 (which is allowed) and E is in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed).\n\n But note: we have to check if the word ""CARET"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\n However, we have to consider that the first guess had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we are putting A in position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, we are putting R in 3 (which is not 2) and E in 4 (which is not 5).\n\n So ""CARET"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait, what about the letter T? We don\'t know if it\'s in the word. We are testing it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used (like S) and also tests the positions.\n\n How about ""CARES""? \n   C A R E S -> positions: \n      1: C\n      2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2 before? We only know it\'s not in 3)\n      3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know it\'s not in 2)\n      4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know it\'s not in 5)\n      5: S (new)\n\n This word is valid.\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2, R in 3, E in 4. We know from the first guess that A is not in 3, so that\'s safe. Similarly, R is not in 2 (we are putting it in 3) and E is not in 5 (we are putting it in 4).\n\n So both ""CARET"" and ""CARES"" are candidates.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We know that the word has R, A, E. We are testing a new letter in both.\n\n But note: in ""CARET"", we are testing T. In ""CARES"", we are testing S.\n\n We don\'t know which one is more likely. But we can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about T and S.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t used and also rearranges the known letters.\n\n But we have to start with C.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRAZE"" -> but Z is less common.\n\n How about ""CABLE""? \n   C A B L E -> but we are missing R? We know the word must have R. So we cannot use ""CABLE"" because it doesn\'t have R.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s stick with words that have all three.\n\n We can also consider ""CERES"" (not common) or ""CERT""? 5 letters? ""CERT"" is 4.\n\n How about ""CARED""? \n   C A R E D -> same as ""CARET"" but with D instead of T.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CARET"" because T is a common letter.\n\n But note: we have to be cautious. We are making the second guess.\n\n However, we have to choose one.\n\n Let me choose ""CARET"" because it uses T and we can see if T is in the word.\n\n But wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get it wrong? But we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put R in 2, A in 3, E in 5? Actually, we are not doing that in ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are putting A in 2 (which is new) and R in 3 (which is new) and E in 4 (new). So we are testing three new positions.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, but we only had one R and one A and one E.\n\n So let\'s guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are not forced to use the known letters in the same positions? Actually, we are: because we know the word has R, A, E and we have to place them in positions that are not the ones we already know are wrong.\n\n However, we are allowed to test new positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and also tests other common letters? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CRIER""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to include A? No, ""CRIER"" doesn\'t have A.\n\n We must have A, R, E.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a good guess.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""CARET"": \n      Position 1: C (correct)\n      Position 2: A (we don\'t know if it\'s correct, but we are testing)\n      Position 3: R (testing)\n      Position 4: E (testing)\n      Position 5: T (testing)\n\n If the word is ""CARET"", we win. Otherwise, we get feedback on A, R, E in these positions and also on T.\n\n But note: we know that the word has R, A, E. So if we get a \'-\' for A, that means A is not in position 2? Then we know A must be in 4 or 5? Similarly, if we get a \'-\' for E, then E is not in 4? Then it must be in 2 or 3? And R must be in 4 or 5? \n\n However, we are testing three new positions for R, A, E. That might be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common and also tests the positions.\n\n But I think ""CARET"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n However, we must consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? Then we would get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if we put A in 2 and the word has A in 2, then ✓)\n   R: ...? In ""CARES"", R is in 3. In ""CARET"", R is in 3. So if the word is ""CARES"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n      R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n      T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n So we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(x)\n\n But if the word is ""CARET"", then we would get: C(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) -> but wait, that would be 5 ✓, which means we won? But we are on the second guess? Actually, we would win.\n\n But if the word is ""CARES"", then we get 4 ✓ and 1 x, and we know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get 4 ✓ and T is absent? Then we try ""CARED"" next? But we have 6 tries, so we can try ""CARET"" and if it\'s not, we try ""CARES"" or ""CARED"".\n\n But we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in new positions.\n\n For example, we can try ""SCARE""? But that doesn\'t start with C.\n\n We must start with C.\n\n How about ""CRAVE""? But we cannot because R is in position 2.\n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" -> but we are missing R? No, we have R? Wait, ""CREAM"" has R? Actually, ""CREAM"" is C R E A M -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CRAPE""? Not common.\n\n How about ""CARES""? That\'s valid.\n\n But let me see: we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put A in 4? Then we have: C _ _ A _\n\n But then we have to put R and E. R can be in 3,4,5? But 4 is taken by A? So R can be in 3 or 5? \n   If we put R in 3: then we have C _ R A _ -> but then we have to put E in 2? Because if we put E in 4, then we have C _ R A E -> but then we have two letters in 4? Actually, we have A in 4 and E in 5? But we know E cannot be in 5? Because in the first guess, E was in 5 and was marked as wrong position. So E cannot be in 5. Therefore, we cannot put E in 5. So if we put A in 4, then we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E R A _ -> but then we have to put the last letter. And R must be in 3 (which is allowed) and E in 2 (allowed) and A in 4 (allowed). Then the last letter is unknown.\n\n Example: ""CERAI""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""CERES""? Not common.\n\n So it\'s hard to form a word with A in 4 and E in 2? \n\n Alternatively, we can put E in 2? Then we have: C E _ _ _\n\n But then we have to put A and R. A can be in 3? But wait, we know A cannot be in 3? Because in the first guess, we had A in 3 and it was wrong. So A cannot be in 3. Therefore, we cannot put A in 3. So A must be in 4 or 5? \n   If we put A in 4: then we have C E _ A _ \n   Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2, and 1 is taken) so R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? But we have to include the E? Actually, we have E in 2, R in 3, A in 4. Then we need two more letters? But we have two positions: 5 and the last one? Actually, we have two more letters: R and A? But we already have C, E, R, A. So we need one more letter? Actually, the word must have 5 letters. We have C, E, R, A, and one more. But we have four letters: C, E, R, A. So we need one more.\n\n So we have to include a fifth letter. We already have C, E, R, A. So the fifth letter is the one we are missing.\n\n We can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions that we haven\'t tested and also tests a new letter.\n\n But we are constrained by the first letter and the constraints on R, A, E.\n\n After thinking, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I will go with ""CARET"".\n\n But wait, what about ""CARES""? It\'s also a valid word. Let me check: \n   ""CARES"" -> C A R E S -> positions: \n        1: C\n        2: A (we haven\'t tested A in 2? We only know A is not in 3. So A in 2 is allowed.)\n        3: R (we haven\'t tested R in 3? We only know R is not in 2. So R in 3 is allowed.)\n        4: E (we haven\'t tested E in 4? We only know E is not in 5. So E in 4 is allowed.)\n        5: S (new)\n\n This is also a valid word.\n\n But note: we are testing S at the end. We are not testing T.\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We can also consider that we have to avoid using letters that might be absent? We don\'t have information about S or T.\n\n Since we are on the second guess, we can choose either. I\'ll choose ""CARET"" because T is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""CARET""\n\n But wait, what if the word is ""CARED""? Then we get:\n   C A R E D -> but then we have R in 3 and E in 4? Then the last letter is D. But we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put A in 2? For example, we can put E in 2 and A in 4? Then we have: C E _ A _\n\n Then we have to put R in 3? (because R cannot be in 2) and then the last letter is the new one. But we have to form a word: C E _ A _ -> we need a letter for position 3 and 5. We can put R in 3? Then we have C E R A _ -> then we need a letter for the last two? Actually, we have two positions: 3 and 5. We can put R in 3 (allowed) and then we have to put a letter in 3 and 5. But we have to include the missing letters. \n\n Example: ""CERAI"" is not a word. ""CERES"" is not common.\n\n How about ""CESAR""? But that\'s not common and it starts with C? Actually, ""CESAR"" is not English? \n\n Another idea: ""CREAM"" is not because R is in 2.\n\n How about ""CREEK""? But we are missing A? We must have A.\n\n So I think ""CARET"" is a solid choice.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""CARET"".\n\n But note: we are using T. If the word is ""CARES"", then we will get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARES"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: x (because the last letter is S, not T)\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T and we try ""CARES"" next.\n\n Alternatively, if the word is ""CARED"", then we get:\n   C: ✓\n   A: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then A is in 2 -> ✓)\n   R: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then R is in 3 -> ✓)\n   E: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then E is in 4 -> ✓)\n   T: ✓ (if the word is ""CARED"", then T is the last letter -> ✓) -> but wait, ""CARED"" has D, so T would be absent? Actually, no: if the word is ""CARED"", then the last letter is D. So we would get T(x) and D(?) -> we don\'t know about D.\n\n Then we would know the last letter is not T, so we try ""CARED"" next? But we have two possibilities: ""CARES"" and ""CARED"". We don\'t know which one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that tests two possibilities at once? But we are constrained by the first letter and the known letters.\n\n Since we have to start with C, we can try ""CARET"" and then based on the feedback, we can deduce.\n\n But we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.\n\n However, we can also try a word that uses a new letter and also tests the positions for R, A, E in a way that covers multiple possibilities.\n\n For example, we can try ""CARES"" to test S. But if we are wrong, we still have 5 tries left.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known letters in the same positions as the first guess? For example, we can put R in 4 or 5? But we don\'t know.\n\n After considering, I think ""CARET"" is a good choice.\n\n So I\'ll go with that.\n\n Guess: ""CARET""\n\n<guess>caret</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- **N** is not in the word (x).\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions from the first guess (R not in position 2, A not in position 3, E not in position 5).\n3. **N** is absent.\n4. The word structure is **C _ _ _ _**.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose **CARET** because:\n- It starts with **C** (satisfies position 1).\n- It places **A** in position 2 (a new position, not ruled out).\n- It places **R** in position 3 (a new position for R, not position 2).\n- It places **E** in position 4 (a new position, not position 5).\n- It introduces **T** (a common letter) to test for presence/absence.\n- It adheres to constraints: **A** is not in position 3, **E** is not in position 5, and **R** is not in position 2.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new positions for known letters and checks for **T**.\n\n<guess>caret</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: caret -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (correct position)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (correct position) -> confirmed again\n  A: ✓ (correct position) -> so A is at position 2\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 3 (because we put R at position 3 and it\'s marked as wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position) -> so E is at position 4\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word starts with C (position 1).\n- Position 2 is A (confirmed by the second guess).\n- Position 4 is E (confirmed by the second guess).\n- The word contains R, but not at position 2 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess). Since position 2 is A and position 4 is E, R must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 3 and 5, but we know it\'s not in 3 (from second guess) and not in 2. But wait, position 5 is the only one left? Actually, we have positions 3, 5. We know R is not in 2 or 3, so it must be in 5? \n\nBut wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\nWe know:\n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: must be R? Because R is in the word and cannot be in 2 or 3. So the only possibility is 5.\n\nBut let\'s check: \n  In the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  In the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. \n  So R cannot be in 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in 5.\n\nBut what about position 3? We don\'t have any letter in position 3 yet? We have position 3 as unknown, and we know that the word has R, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess, we placed R in position 3 and got a \'-\' meaning that R is in the word but not in position 3. So position 3 is not R.\n\nTherefore, the only position left for R is 5.\n\nSo the word is: C, A, ?, E, R\n\nBut wait, we also know that the word contains R, and we have placed R in two positions that were wrong, so it must be in 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain T (from the second guess) and does not contain N (from the first guess).\n\nSo the word is: C A ? E R\n\nNow, what about position 3? We need a letter that is in the word. We know the word has 5 letters: C, A, E, R, and one more letter in position 3.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWhat letters can be in position 3? \n  It cannot be T (because T is absent) and cannot be N (absent). Also, it cannot be any of the letters we know that are absent? But we don\'t have a full list.\n\nWe have to consider: what letters are possible? \n  We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T (from the two guesses). So we know N and T are absent. The other letters: C, R, A, E are present.\n\nBut the word has 5 letters. We have C, A, E, R, and one more. That means the missing letter is a new letter that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe don\'t know if the new letter is in the set of letters we have tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T. So the absent letters are N and T. The present letters are C, A, E, R.\n\nSo the word has 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily. But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with C, has A in the second position, E in the fourth, R in the fifth, and an unknown letter in the third.\n\nSo the pattern is: C A ? E R\n\nWhat words fit this pattern?\n  We can think of words like: \n    ""CAVER"" (meaning: a cave explorer) -> but that\'s not common.\n    ""CAUER"" (not a word)\n    ""CATER"" -> but we tried that? No, we tried ""CARET"" which is similar.\n\nActually, ""CARET"" was our second guess. But note: ""CATER"" is a word? Yes, meaning a servant or a menu item. But we tried ""CARET"" and got T absent. So ""CATER"" would be C A ? E R -> if we put T in position 3, but then we know T is absent? So ""CATER"" is not possible because T is absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nWhat about ""CARES""? \n  C A R E S -> but that would be C A R E S, so position 3 is R. But we know that R is in the word, but we haven\'t placed R in position 3? Actually, in the second guess we placed R in position 3 and it was marked as wrong position? That means that R is not in position 3. So if we put R in position 3 again, it would be wrong again? But we know it\'s not in 3. So ""CARES"" would have R in 3, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\nBut wait, in ""CARES"", the R is in position 3, but we already know that R is not in position 3 (from the second guess). So it would be invalid to guess a word with R in 3.\n\nTherefore, the word must have a letter in position 3 that is not R, and not T, and not N (which we know is absent).\n\nSo we are looking for words of the form: C A X E R, where X is a letter that is not T, N, and also not C, A, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates? But we don\'t know for sure, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far).\n\nPossible letters for X: \n  We have to avoid: T, N (absent), and also C, A, E, R (present but we are putting them in other positions). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication. So we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo X must be a new letter that we haven\'t tried and is not T, N, C, A, E, R.\n\nWe have tried: C, R, A, N, E, T.\n\nSo the available letters: \n  All letters except: A, C, E, N, R, T.\n\nBut we know the word has A, C, E, R, and one more. So the new letter must be one that we haven\'t used.\n\nWe can list the available letters: \n  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to choose a word that is common.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""CAVER"" -> meaning: one who caves, or a cave explorer. (not common)\n  ""CAUER"" -> not a word.\n  ""CATER"" -> but T is absent, so no.\n  ""CARED"" -> but we have E in position 4 and R in 5, so ""CARED"" would be C A R E D -> but that has R in position 3? No, in ""CARED"": \n        Position 1: C\n        Position 2: A\n        Position 3: R -> but we know R is not in position 3 (from the second guess: we had R in 3 and it was wrong). So we cannot put R in 3.\n\n  ""CARES"" -> but that has R in 3? Same issue.\n\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R -> K is not tried. This is a word (one who cakes).\n\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R -> L is not tried. This is a word (one who calves).\n\n  ""CAMER"" -> not common? But ""CAMER"" might be a name? Not a common word.\n\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R -> P is not tried. This is a word (one who caps).\n\n  ""CARER"" -> C A R E R -> but that has R in position 3? And also R at the end. But we know R is not in position 3. So invalid.\n\n  ""CATER"" is out because T is absent.\n\n  ""CARED"" is out because R is in position 3 (which is not allowed).\n\nSo the candidates are:\n  ""CAKER"" -> C A K E R\n  ""CALER"" -> C A L E R\n  ""CAPER"" -> C A P E R\n  ""CAVER"" -> C A V E R (a cave explorer)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider: what about the first guess? We had A in position 3 and it was wrong. Now we have A in position 2 and it\'s correct. So that\'s consistent.\n\nSimilarly, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong, but now we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct.\n\nAnd R is in position 5 and we haven\'t tested that position for R.\n\nSo we can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut we have to be efficient. We can try a word that uses a common letter to test multiple possibilities? But we only have one position left.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that we haven\'t tried and also tests the position for the unknown letter.\n\nBut we are constrained: the word must start with C, have A in 2, E in 4, R in 5, and the third letter is what we don\'t know.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"". If it\'s not, we get feedback on K.\n\nBut we have 4 more guesses? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t follow the pattern? Actually, we have to follow the pattern because we are almost sure that the word is one of these.\n\nBut let me think: are there other words?\n\nWhat about ""CABER""? Not a word.\n\nOr ""CAYER""? Not a word.\n\nSo the common words are: CAKER, LAYER? But LAYER has L in position 2? No, we have A in position 2.\n\nSo the words we have: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s stick to common words.\n\nWe can also consider ""CATER"" but T is absent, so we cannot use that.\n\nAnother word: ""CARET"" we tried and T is absent.\n\nSo the common ones are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" to test K.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that\'s not a word and doesn\'t end with R.\n\nWe must stick to the pattern: C A ? E R.\n\nSo we have to choose one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAWER""? C A W E R -> is that a word? It might be a rare word, but we can check. Actually, ""CAWER"" is not a standard word.\n\nSo the most common words are: CAKER, CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter? Or we can try ""CAPER"" because P is common.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try one.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled out because R is in 3? We know R is not in 3.\n\nAnother idea: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that R is in position 5 and we have R in position 3? But we know from the second guess that R is not in position 3. So that\'s not possible.\n\nSimilarly, what if the word is ""CAMEO""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has M and O? But we know position 4 must be E. So no.\n\nSo we are sure that the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nBut CAVER is not common. Let\'s assume the common ones.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to check if the word ""CAKER"" is valid. Yes, it is a word.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: what if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  R: - (in word, but not position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in position 5, so that\'s consistent.\n  A: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in position 2, so that\'s consistent. And we are putting A in 2 now (which is correct) and we didn\'t put A in 3? Actually, in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so when we guessed ""crane"" (which had A in 3) it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent.\n\n  N: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no N.\n  E: - (in word, but not position 5) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\nSecond guess: ""caret""\n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  A: ✓ (position 2) -> in ""CAKER"", A is in 2, so that\'s correct.\n  R: - (in word, but not position 3) -> in ""CAKER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3 it\'s wrong, which is consistent.\n  E: ✓ (position 4) -> in ""CAKER"", E is in 4, so that\'s correct.\n  T: x (absent) -> consistent, because ""CAKER"" has no T.\n\nSo ""CAKER"" is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, we can check for ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"".\n\nBut we don\'t know which one. So we can try ""CAKER"" to see.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests the third position with a letter that is common to multiple possibilities? But we are forced to use one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also try a word that doesn\'t use the pattern? But we are almost sure that the word is one of these. So we can guess one.\n\nI think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nWhat about the possibility that the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""CARED""? But we know that in the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct, and we don\'t have a duplicate E? Actually, ""CARED"" has two E\'s? But we have E in position 4. The first guess had E in position 5 and it was wrong, and in the second guess we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two E\'s, then in the first guess (when we had E in 5) it would have been marked as present (but we had only one E in the guess) so it might be that the word has two E\'s? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nHowever, in the second guess, we have E in position 4 and it\'s correct. If the word had another E, we might have seen a duplicate mark? But we didn\'t have another E. So it\'s possible, but we have no evidence.\n\nBut we can rule out duplicates? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nSo let\'s assume no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the word is one of: CAKER, CALER, CAPER, CAVER.\n\nWe can try ""CAKER"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try another.\n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nSo we can try ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABER""? But that\'s not a word.\n\nOr ""CAJER""? Not a word.\n\nSo I think ""CAKER"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""CAKER"".\n\nBut let me see the feedback we would get if the word is ""CALER"" or ""CAPER"". \n\nIf the word is ""CALER"": \n  C A L E R\n  Our guess: C A K E R\n  Feedback: \n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      K: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put K) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then L is in position 3. So when we put K in 3, it\'s wrong. So we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) -> then we know the third letter is not K, so we try ""CALER"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if the word is ""CAPER"", we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAPER"".\n\nBut if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get: C(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓) and then we try ""CAVER"".\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSo I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose ""CAKER"" because K is a common letter.\n\nSo the guess is ""CAKER"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the fact that the word might have a duplicate?

E R, with the third letter missing.\n- The missing letter cannot be K (because we got two x\'s for K in position 2 and 3? Actually, the feedback for the second guess had K? No, the second guess was ""caret"" which does not contain K. And the third guess was ""kaker"" which has K in position 1,2, and 3? But we are only interested in the third position.\n\nThe feedback for ""kaker"":\n  Position 1: K -> x (not in the word)\n  Position 2: A -> ✓ (correct)\n  Position 3: K -> x (not in the word)\n  Position 4: E -> ✓ (correct)\n  Position 5: R -> ✓ (correct)\n\nSo we learn that K is not in the word at all. Also, we already knew that N and T are not in the word.\n\nSo now the absent letters are: N, T, K.\n\nWe also know the word is C A ? E R, and the third letter must be a letter that is not A, C, E, R (because we are assuming no duplicates) and not N, T, K.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that fits C A ? E R, with the third letter being one of the remaining letters.\n\nWe can list possible letters for the third position:\n  From the alphabet, excluding: A, C, E, R (known present letters), and excluding N, T, K (absent).\n\nSo available letters: \n  B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""CABER"" -> not a common word? (meaning: to jump or leap? but not standard)\n  ""CADER"" -> not a word.\n  ""CAVER"" -> a cave explorer (but we considered it earlier, and K is absent so it might be it? but we have two E\'s? no, we have E in position 4 and the third letter is not E? Actually, we have E in position 4, so the third letter cannot be E? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate E? We have to consider the possibility.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. In the second guess, we had E in position 4 and it was correct. So if the word has two E\'s, then in the first guess we might have gotten a duplicate mark? But we only had one E in the first guess. Similarly, in the second guess we had one E. So if there is a duplicate E, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nBut we can check: \n  If the word is ""CAVER"": \n      C A V E R\n      First guess ""crane"": \n          C: ✓\n          R: in the word but not in position 2 -> V is in the word? No, in ""CAVER"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""CAVER"" has R at the end? Actually, ""CAVER"" is C A V E R -> so it has R. But in the first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5. So when we guessed R in position 2, it was wrong, which is consistent. Also, in the second guess, we had R in position 3 and it was wrong (because R is in 5, not 3). So ""CAVER"" is possible? But we have E in position 4. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes. And we have A in position 2? Yes.\n\n  But what about the first guess: we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it was wrong, which is consistent.\n\n  Also, E was in position 5 in the first guess and was wrong. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so that\'s consistent.\n\n  So ""CAVER"" is possible.\n\n  But we have to check if the feedback for the second guess is consistent: \n      Second guess: ""caret"" -> we had E in position 4 and it was correct. In ""CAVER"", E is in position 4? Yes.\n\n  However, we also have to check the third letter: in ""caret"", we had R in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong. In ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it\'s not there, so the mark is correct.\n\n  But wait, in ""CAVER"", the third letter is V. We didn\'t test V in any position? So it\'s possible.\n\n  But we have to see if it fits all feedback.\n\n  First guess: \n      ""crane"" vs ""caver"":\n          C: ✓\n          R: in ""caver"" there is no R? Wait, no: ""caver"" has R at the end. So when we guessed R in position 2, it should be marked as present but wrong. In ""caver"", R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 2, it\'s wrong, so the \'-\' is correct.\n          A: in ""caver"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it\'s wrong, so the \'-\' is correct.\n          N: not in ""caver"" -> correct.\n          E: in ""caver"" E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it\'s wrong, so \'-\' is correct.\n\n      So first guess feedback is consistent.\n\n      Second guess: ""caret"" vs ""caver"":\n          C: ✓\n          A: ✓ (position 2)\n          R: in ""caver"" R is in position 5, so when we put R in position 3, it\'s wrong -> \'-\' is correct.\n          E: ✓ (position 4)\n          T: not in ""caver"" -> x is correct.\n\n  So ""CAVER"" is consistent.\n\nBut we have two x\'s for K in the third guess? Actually, we didn\'t use ""caver"" in the third guess. We used ""kaker"". \n\nSo ""CAVER"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have other candidates: \n  ""CABER"" -> not common, and we are not sure.\n  ""CALER"": C A L E R -> L is not tried? We haven\'t used L.\n  ""CAPER"": C A P E R -> P not tried.\n  ""CADER"": not a word.\n  ""CAFER"": not a word.\n  ""CALMER"": not 5 letters? It\'s 6.\n  ""CAMEO"": doesn\'t fit.\n\nSo the common words are: CALER, CAPER.\n\nWe can try one of them.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nIf we guess ""CALER"":\n  If it\'s correct, we win.\n  If not, then we know it must be ""CAPER"" (since ""CAVER"" is also possible, but we have to check).\n\nBut we have multiple candidates: \n  ""CAVER"" (C A V E R)\n  ""CALER"" (C A L E R)\n  ""CAPER"" (C A P E R)\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" first.\n\nBut we also have to consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it\'s not a common word.\n\nOr ""CAYER""? Not a word.\n\nSo we have three strong candidates: ""CAVER"", ""CALER"", ""CAPER"".\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" because L is a common letter.\n\nBut we have to be careful: we are on the fourth guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t use the pattern? But we are almost sure that it\'s one of these.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""CALER"".\n\nIf we guess ""CALER"":\n  If it\'s correct, we win.\n  If not, then we know it\'s either ""CAVER"" or ""CAPER"", and we can try one of them in the next guess.\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess.\n\nWe can also try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut let me see: we have to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"" to test L.\n\nBut we can also try ""CAVER"" to test V? Or ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nSince we have two possibilities left (if ""CALER"" is wrong, then it must be ""CAPER"" or ""CAVER""), we can try ""CAPER"" to test P.\n\nBut if we try ""CAPER"" and it\'s wrong, then we have two options left: ""CAVER"" and ""CALER"". Then we can try one.\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 2 more after this guess? But we can solve in this guess.\n\nSo let\'s try ""CAPER"".\n\nBut we can also try ""CALER"".\n\nI think ""CALER"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check the feedback for ""CAPER"": \n  If the word is ""CAPER"": \n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      P: ✓ (if the word is ""CAPER"", then P is in position 3 -> ✓)\n      E: ✓\n      R: ✓\n\n  So if we get all ✓, we win.\n\n  If the word is ""CALER"", then we would get:\n      C: ✓\n      A: ✓\n      P: x (because L is the correct letter, but we put P) -> but if the word is ""CALER"", then position 3 is L, so we would get P(x) and then we know it\'s ""CALER"".\n      E: ✓\n      R: ✓\n\n  Similarly, if the word is ""CAVER"", then we get P(x) and then we know to try ""CAVER"".\n\nBut we can also consider: what if the word is ""CABER""? But it\'s not common and we don\'t know.\n\nSo I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: what if the word is ""CARES""? But we already ruled that out because R is in position 5 and we know it\'s not in 3.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CADER"" is not a word.\n\nSo I think the only common words are ""CALER"", ""CAPER"", ""CAVER"".\n\nWe can try ""CALER"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""CAVER"". \n\nWe can also try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CALYX""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nSo I think we should guess ""CALER"".\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: \n  ""CALER"" is a valid English word (meaning: more frequent or common in a particular place? or a type of fish? but also used in sports).\n\n  ""CAPER"" is also valid (one who caps).\n\n  ""CAVER"" is less common (a cave explorer).\n\nSo between ""CALER"" and ""CAPER"", I\'ll choose ""CALER"" because L is more common than P.\n\nBut we have no information about L or P.\n\nSo we can try ""CALER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be careful. What if the word is ""CABIN""? But that doesn\'t have E in position 4 and R in 5? And it has B and I? But we know position 4 must be E.\n\nSo I think ""CALER"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""CALER"".\n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""CALER"" and it\'s not the word, then we know the third letter is not L. Then we can try ""CAPER"" next, and if that\'s not, then ""CAVER"".\n\nBut we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this.\n\nSo we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try ""CAPER"" first.\n\nI think it doesn\'t matter.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter that is common to the set? But we don\'t have a set.\n\nWe can try ""S"" as a new letter? But we are forced to put a letter in position 3.\n\nWe can try ""CALER"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CALER"".\n\n<guess>caler</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n### Key Insights from Feedback:\n1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 correct).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 2).\n   - **A** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **N** x (not in word).\n   - **E** - (in word, but not position 5).\n\n2. **Guess 2 (""caret"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **R** - (in word, but not position 3).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **T** x (not in word).\n\n3. **Guess 3 (""kaker"")**:\n   - **C** ✓ (position 1 confirmed).\n   - **A** ✓ (position 2 confirmed).\n   - **K** x (not in word).\n   - **E** ✓ (position 4 confirmed).\n   - **R** ✓ (position 5 confirmed).\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Fixed positions**:\n  - Position 1: **C**\n  - Position 2: **A**\n  - Position 4: **E**\n  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback: R cannot be in positions 2 or 3, and positions 1, 2, 4 are fixed).\n- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K** (from feedback).\n- **Word structure**: **C A ?

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter is not P (and also not N, T, K, L, because we have ruled them out).

We still have two candidates: ""CAVER"" (V in position 3) and ""CAVER"" was the only other possibility? But wait, we have ""CAVER"" and ""CAPER"", but we just ruled out ""CAPER"" because P is absent.

So the only remaining candidate is ""CAVER"".

Therefore, we must guess ""CAVER"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""CAVER"": C A V E R

Check against feedback:

First guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ -> matches
  R: - -> in ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we guessed R in position 2, it's wrong, so consistent.
  A: - -> in ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, consistent.
  N: x -> absent, consistent.
  E: - -> in ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, consistent.

Second guess ""caret"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  R: - -> in ""CAVER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3, it's wrong, consistent.
  E: ✓
  T: x -> absent, consistent.

Third guess ""kaker"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  K: x -> absent, consistent (because ""CAVER"" has no K)
  E: ✓
  R: ✓

Fourth guess ""caler"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  L: x -> absent, consistent (because ""CAVER"" has no L)
  E: ✓
  R: ✓

Fifth guess ""caper"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  P: x -> absent, because ""CAVER"" has no P -> consistent.

So ""CAVER"" is consistent with all feedback.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CAVER"".

We guess ""CAVER"".

  - Position 4: **E**
  - Position 5: **R** (deduced from feedback).
- **Absent letters**: **N**, **T**, **K**, **L**, **P** (from feedback).
- **Word structure**: **C A ? E R** (position 3 is unknown).
- **Constraints for position 3**:
  - Cannot be **A**, **C**, **E**, or **R** (no duplicates indicated).
  - Cannot be **N**, **T**, **K**, **L**, or **P** (absent).
  - Must be a new letter not yet tested.

### Analysis of Position 3 Options:
- The only common English word fitting **C A ? E R** is **CAVER** (V in position 3).
  - **CAPER** was eliminated because **P** is absent (feedback from Guess 5).
  - **CALER**, **CATER**, **CARED**, **CABER**, etc., are invalid due to ruled-out letters (**L**, **T**, **P**, etc.).
- **CAVER** remains:  
  - **C** (pos 1), **A** (pos 2), **V** (pos 3), **E** (pos 4), **R** (pos 5).

### Why ""CAVER""?
- Consistent with all feedback:
  - Contains **R**, **A**, **E** as required.
  - **V** is untested and not absent.
  - Rules out all other candidates (**CAPER**, **CALER**, etc.).

### Next Guess:
- **CAVER** is the only logical choice. If correct, the puzzle is solved.

<guess>caver</guess>",caver,"We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""caper"":
  C: ✓ (correct position)
  A: ✓ (correct position)
  P: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  R: ✓ (correct position)

So now we know:
- The word is C A ? E R, with the third letter missing.
- The missing letter is not P (and also not N, T, K, L, because we have ruled them out).

We still have two candidates: ""CAVER"" (V in position 3) and ""CAVER"" was the only other possibility? But wait, we have ""CAVER"" and ""CAPER"", but we just ruled out ""CAPER"" because P is absent.

So the only remaining candidate is ""CAVER"".

Therefore, we must guess ""CAVER"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""CAVER"": C A V E R

Check against feedback:

First guess ""crane"":
  C: ✓ -> matches
  R: - -> in ""CAVER"", R is in position 5, so when we guessed R in position 2, it's wrong, so consistent.
  A: - -> in ""CAVER"", A is in position 2, so when we guessed A in position 3, it's wrong, consistent.
  N: x -> absent, consistent.
  E: - -> in ""CAVER"", E is in position 4, so when we guessed E in position 5, it's wrong, consistent.

Second guess ""caret"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  R: - -> in ""CAVER"", R is in 5, so when we put R in 3, it's wrong, consistent.
  E: ✓
  T: x -> absent, consistent.

Third guess ""kaker"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  K: x -> absent, consistent (because ""CAVER"" has no K)
  E: ✓
  R: ✓

Fourth guess ""caler"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  L: x -> absent, consistent (because ""CAVER"" has no L)
  E: ✓
  R: ✓

Fifth guess ""caper"":
  C: ✓
  A: ✓
  P: x -> absent, because ""CAVER"" has no P -> consistent.

So ""CAVER"" is consistent with all feedback.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CAVER"".

We guess ""CAVER"".
