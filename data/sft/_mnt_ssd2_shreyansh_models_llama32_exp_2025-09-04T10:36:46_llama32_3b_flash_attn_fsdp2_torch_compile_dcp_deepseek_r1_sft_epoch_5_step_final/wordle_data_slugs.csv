We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""roast"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 S: - (in the word but wrong position)
 T: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""roast"" it was at position 4 and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters R, O, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter S and does not contain R, O, A, T.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, O, A, T.
   - Contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since S is in the word, we can try to place S in a different position. Since it was in position 4 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have to avoid R, O, A, T.

 Let's try to form a word that includes S and uses other common letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Possible common letters: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can try a word that has S in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5.

 Example words:
   - We could try ""SPINE"": but note that we have to avoid R, O, A, T. However, we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word. But wait, we haven't tried these.

 But note: we must include S and it cannot be in position 4. In ""SPINE"", S is in position 1.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So position 1 is a new position and might be correct.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has S and uses common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, P, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""LINES"" but that has 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""LINES"" is 5 letters: L, I, N, E, S. But note that S is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, O, A, T.

 However, we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake of putting S in position 4? In ""LINES"", S is in position 5, which is different from 4.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess told us that S is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. So we can try position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 1 to see if it's there.

 However, we don't have any information about position 1, so we can try.

 But note: we have to use only letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Let me list some words that have S and are 5 letters long, without R, O, A, T:

 - Using E, I, L, N, P: 
     ""SPINE"" -> S at position 1, then P, I, N, E.
     ""SLEEP"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. Also, we have S at position 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because we know that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was wrong. So we must avoid putting S at position 4.

     Actually, we must avoid position 4 for S? No, the feedback said that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was present but misplaced, meaning that the secret word has S but not at position 4. So in the next guess, we can try S at a different position.

     But note: we are allowed to put S at position 4 again? However, we know it's not there because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it again at 4. We should try a new position.

     So for the second guess, we should try S in a position that is not 4.

 Let me think of words with S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We can try position 1: ""SPINE"", ""SLEEP"" (but that has two E's and we don't know if E is present) -> but we don't know about E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 2: for example, ""USING"" -> but that has U and I and S, but also G and N. But note: we haven't tried U, I, G, N.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""USING"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has S and also other common letters that we haven't tested, such as E, I, L, N, P, H, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has S and as many new common letters as possible.

 Possibilities:
   - ""SPINE"": S at 1, then P, I, N, E. This covers P, I, N, E (all new) and S (which we know is present). But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we don't have any information about duplicates.

   - ""SLEPT"": but T is not allowed (we know T is not in the word because it was marked x in the first guess). So we cannot use T.

   - ""SLEEP"": has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. But we can try? However, we are allowed to try, but we might get less information because of the duplicate E.

   - ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E. This avoids R, O, A, T.

   - ""SPINE"" and ""SHINE"" are both options.

 But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to use distinct letters.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"": 
   - S at position 1 (which is a new position for S, so we can check if it's correct there)
   - Then H, I, N, E: which are all new letters.

 But wait, we know that S is in the word, so we are using that knowledge. Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PINES"": but that has S at the end (position 5) and P, I, N, E. But note: we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word.

 However, we have to avoid R, O, A, T. ""PINES"" is valid.

 But let me think: we have only 6 tries, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""SLICE"" -> but L, I, C, E. However, we don't know about L, I, C, E. But note: we cannot use T, but L, I, C, E are allowed.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""SLICE"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me choose ""SLICE"": 
   - S at position 1? But we don't know if S is at position 1. We are trying to test S in a new position (position 1) because in the first guess it was at position 4 and was misplaced.

 However, note that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So it could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We are trying S at position 1 in ""SLICE"". If we get a ✓ for S, then we know S is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2, 3, or 5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know S is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for S.

 So let's go with ""SLICE"".

 But note: we are also testing L, I, C, E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 However, I think ""SLICE"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the fact that we know S is in the word? We are using that knowledge.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5? For example, ""PILES"" -> but that has two S's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, to keep it simple, let's try ""SLICE"".

 But note: we must avoid T, and ""SLICE"" does not have T.

 So I will go with ""SLICE"".

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLICE"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SLICE"".

 But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also uses more common letters. 

 Another candidate: ""SPINE"" (S at 1, then P, I, N, E) is also good.

 How about ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E.

 We can choose any of these.

 I think I'll go with ""SHINE"" because it has H which is a common consonant.

 But note: we have to avoid R, O, A, T. All these words do.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"".

 However, we are using S at position 1. If S is actually at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know S is at 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 So, I'll guess ""SHINE"".

 But wait, what if the word has S at position 5? Then by putting S at position 1, we might get a '-' and then we know S is at 5. That would be good too.

 So either way, we get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice.

 So, the guess is ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, N, E. We are testing them.

 Let me write the guess: SHINE.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So, I'll go with ""SHINE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":
- R, O, A, T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **S** (since it's in the word) but **not in position 4**.
- Must **avoid** R, O, A, T entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., E, I, L, N, H) to maximize information.

I chose **SHINE** because:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, N, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, O, A, T) and position 4 for S.

 But wait, what if the word has S at position 5? Then by putting S at position 1, we might get a '-' and then we know S is at 5. That would be good too.

 So either way, we get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice.

 So, the guess is ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, N, E. We are testing them.

 Let me write the guess: SHINE.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So, I'll go with ""SHINE"".

<guess>shine</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":
- R, O, A, T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **S** (since it's in the word) but **not in position 4**.
- Must **avoid** R, O, A, T entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., E, I, L, N, H) to maximize information.

I chose **SHINE** because:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, N, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, O, A, T) and position 4 for S.",Guess 2: shine -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>roast</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""roast"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 S: - (in the word but wrong position)
 T: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""roast"" it was at position 4 and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters R, O, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter S and does not contain R, O, A, T.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, O, A, T.
   - Contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since S is in the word, we can try to place S in a different position. Since it was in position 4 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have to avoid R, O, A, T.

 Let's try to form a word that includes S and uses other common letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Possible common letters: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can try a word that has S in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5.

 Example words:
   - We could try ""SPINE"": but note that we have to avoid R, O, A, T. However, we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word. But wait, we haven't tried these.

 But note: we must include S and it cannot be in position 4. In ""SPINE"", S is in position 1.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So position 1 is a new position and might be correct.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has S and uses common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, P, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""LINES"" but that has 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""LINES"" is 5 letters: L, I, N, E, S. But note that S is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, O, A, T.

 However, we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake of putting S in position 4? In ""LINES"", S is in position 5, which is different from 4.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess told us that S is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. So we can try position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 1 to see if it's there.

 However, we don't have any information about position 1, so we can try.

 But note: we have to use only letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Let me list some words that have S and are 5 letters long, without R, O, A, T:

 - Using E, I, L, N, P: 
     ""SPINE"" -> S at position 1, then P, I, N, E.
     ""SLEEP"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. Also, we have S at position 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because we know that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was wrong. So we must avoid putting S at position 4.

     Actually, we must avoid position 4 for S? No, the feedback said that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was present but misplaced, meaning that the secret word has S but not at position 4. So in the next guess, we can try S at a different position.

     But note: we are allowed to put S at position 4 again? However, we know it's not there because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it again at 4. We should try a new position.

     So for the second guess, we should try S in a position that is not 4.

 Let me think of words with S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We can try position 1: ""SPINE"", ""SLEEP"" (but that has two E's and we don't know if E is present) -> but we don't know about E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 2: for example, ""USING"" -> but that has U and I and S, but also G and N. But note: we haven't tried U, I, G, N.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""USING"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has S and also other common letters that we haven't tested, such as E, I, L, N, P, H, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has S and as many new common letters as possible.

 Possibilities:
   - ""SPINE"": S at 1, then P, I, N, E. This covers P, I, N, E (all new) and S (which we know is present). But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we don't have any information about duplicates.

   - ""SLEPT"": but T is not allowed (we know T is not in the word because it was marked x in the first guess). So we cannot use T.

   - ""SLEEP"": has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. But we can try? However, we are allowed to try, but we might get less information because of the duplicate E.

   - ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E. This avoids R, O, A, T.

   - ""SPINE"" and ""SHINE"" are both options.

 But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to use distinct letters.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"": 
   - S at position 1 (which is a new position for S, so we can check if it's correct there)
   - Then H, I, N, E: which are all new letters.

 But wait, we know that S is in the word, so we are using that knowledge. Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PINES"": but that has S at the end (position 5) and P, I, N, E. But note: we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word.

 However, we have to avoid R, O, A, T. ""PINES"" is valid.

 But let me think: we have only 6 tries, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""SLICE"" -> but L, I, C, E. However, we don't know about L, I, C, E. But note: we cannot use T, but L, I, C, E are allowed.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""SLICE"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me choose ""SLICE"": 
   - S at position 1? But we don't know if S is at position 1. We are trying to test S in a new position (position 1) because in the first guess it was at position 4 and was misplaced.

 However, note that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So it could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We are trying S at position 1 in ""SLICE"". If we get a ✓ for S, then we know S is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2, 3, or 5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know S is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for S.

 So let's go with ""SLICE"".

 But note: we are also testing L, I, C, E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 However, I think ""SLICE"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the fact that we know S is in the word? We are using that knowledge.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5? For example, ""PILES"" -> but that has two S's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, to keep it simple, let's try ""SLICE"".

 But note: we must avoid T, and ""SLICE"" does not have T.

 So I will go with ""SLICE"".

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLICE"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SLICE"".

 But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also uses more common letters. 

 Another candidate: ""SPINE"" (S at 1, then P, I, N, E) is also good.

 How about ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E.

 We can choose any of these.

 I think I'll go with ""SHINE"" because it has H which is a common consonant.

 But note: we have to avoid R, O, A, T. All these words do.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"".

 However, we are using S at position 1. If S is actually at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know S is at 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 So, I'll guess ""SHINE"".

 But wait, what if the word has S at position 5? Then by putting S at position 1, we might get a '-' and then we know S is at 5. That would be good too.

 So either way, we get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice.

 So, the guess is ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, N, E. We are testing them.

 Let me write the guess: SHINE.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So, I'll go with ""SHINE"".

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- R, O, A, T are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with S.
- H, I, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with S.
- The word contains S (which we already knew) and now we know it's at position 1.
- The following letters are not in the word: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We have used the letters: R, O, A, S, T, H, I, N, E.

We know the word starts with S and has an S at position 1. The other letters are unknown.

We need to avoid the letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We also know that S is in the word and we now know its position (position 1). So we don't need to test S again? Actually, we can use S again? But note: we know S is in the word and at position 1, so we can use S at position 1 in every guess? But the rules don't say we can't. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 1 and then try to find the other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

So, the secret word is of the form: S _ _ _ _

We need to fill the next four positions with letters that are not in the set {R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E}.

We have to choose a word that starts with S and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: We have not used: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words that start with S and use the available letters.

Possible words:
- SLEEP: but E is excluded (from guess2: E(x)), so not allowed.
- SHINE: H and I and N and E are excluded, so not allowed.
- Other words: let's think of words starting with S and without the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

So, available: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try:
- SLEEPY? But that's 6 letters. No, must be 5 letters.
- SLIMY: S, L, I, M, Y -> but I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), so not allowed.
- SLICK: S, L, I, C, K -> I is excluded, so no.
- SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> U, M, P are available? Let's check: 
  - U is not excluded, M not excluded, P not excluded. But what about L? L is available.

But wait, we have to avoid I, so ""SLICK"" is invalid because of I.

Another word: ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available? U, L, K, Y are not excluded. So that's a candidate.

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but O is excluded (from guess1: O(x)), so no.

Another: ""SCULP"" -> not a common word.

Another: ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> but we have two S's? The word has S at position 1 and then S at position 5? But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are allowed to use S again? But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 5 to test? But we have to avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in this guess? In ""SULKS"", S is at position 1 and 5. We are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't say we can't. But the feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know that S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, then:
- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' or '-'? But if it has two S's, then it might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but in the wrong position, or '✓' if it's in the word and at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SULKS"" uses U, L, K, S. S is already known, so we are testing U, L, K.

But we have to consider that the word might have two S's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in the last position to avoid confusion? But we are allowed to test.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""SUDSY"": S, U, D, S, Y -> again, S at position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So if we put S at position 4, we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting S at position 4. Therefore, ""SUDSY"" is not good because it has S at position 4.

We should avoid putting S at position 4 because we know it's not there.

So, for the third guess, we should try to put S only at position 1 (since we know it's correct there) and avoid position 4. We can put S at other positions? But we don't know if there are multiple S's. However, we are not forced to put S only at position 1? But if we put S at another position, then we can check if there is a second S.

But we have to fill the blanks with letters that are not excluded.

Let me list possible words:

- ""SULKS"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K. But we are testing U, L, K. And we avoid the excluded letters.

- ""SULKY"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K, Y.

- ""SUDOR"": but O is excluded.

- ""SUGAR"": but A and R are excluded.

- ""SULKY"" and ""SULKS"" are both options.

But we also have other letters to test. We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses other common available letters, such as L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

For example:
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> but S at position 5? And we avoid position 4? Actually, we are putting S at position 5, which is fine. But we are also putting S at position 1 and 5. The word has two S's? We don't know. But we are testing L, U, M.

But note: we are using S at position 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 will be marked as 'x' (because the only S is at position 1 and it's already marked as ✓? But wait, the feedback for the first guess: we had only one S and it was at position 4 and got '-', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 and 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, then putting S at position 5 would be wrong and we should get an 'x' for that S. But we already have a ✓ for the S at position 1. So if we put S at position 5 and the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If the word has two S's, then we might get a '-' for the S at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. So it's acceptable.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can try.

However, we have to choose a word that is valid.

But let me think of words without duplicate S? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S again? But we know S is in the word, and we have it at position 1. We don't have to use S again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

We can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that we can test other letters.

For example, we can try a word that has S only at position 1 and then four new letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to find words starting with S and using four letters from the available set.

Common available letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Words:
- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available. Valid word.
- ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> has duplicate S.
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> duplicate S.
- ""SCULP"": not common.
- ""SUDOR"": O excluded.
- ""SUGAR"": A and R excluded.
- ""SULKY"" seems good.

But we also have ""SLYLY"": but Y is repeated and not common.

Another: ""SCAMP"": S, C, A, M, P -> A is excluded.

Another: ""SCOWL"": O and W? O is excluded.

Another: ""SKIMP"": S, K, I, M, P -> I is excluded.

Another: ""SLICK"": I excluded.

Another: ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all available? L, U, M, P are not excluded. So ""SLUMP"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKY"" is valid.

But ""SLUMP"" has S at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know position 4: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was misplaced. Now we are putting M at position 4? That's fine.

We can also try ""SPUMY"": S, P, U, M, Y -> all available? P, U, M, Y are not excluded. But ""SPUMY"" is a word? It means frothy, but it's not very common.

""SULKS"" is more common? But it has duplicate S.

I think ""SULKY"" is a good choice because it uses U, L, K, Y, which are common enough.

But we have to consider: we are testing U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.

We know position 4: we had S at 4 and it was wrong, but we don't know what is at position 4. So we are testing K at position 4? That's fine.

But note: we are not sure if the word has U, L, K, Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKY"" and if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have another option: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses letters that we haven't tested, such as C, D, U, M, P, etc.

For example, ""SCAMP"" is invalid because of A.

""SCUDS"": S, C, U, D, S -> duplicate S and S at position 5? But we are putting S at position 5. And C, U, D are available.

But ""SCUDS"" is a word? It means small waves, but not common.

""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> duplicate S, and P, U, D are available.

But we are putting S at position 5 again.

We can try ""SULKY"" or ""SULKS"" or ""SPUMY"".

But let me think of a word that has S at position 1 and then four new letters without duplicate.

How about ""SPLIT"": but P, L, I, T -> I and T are excluded.

""SCOLD"": O excluded.

""SCOUR"": O and R excluded.

""SCUFF"": S, C, U, F, F -> duplicate F? And F is available. But ""SCUFF"" is a word? It means to strike with the heel of the foot, but rare.

""SKIFF"": I excluded.

""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> duplicate K? And K is available.

But ""SKULK"" is a word.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SKULK"" has K, U, L, and S. S is already known. So it's valid.

But we are using K twice? Actually, it's S, K, U, L, K -> so two K's. Not ideal.

How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all distinct and available. Valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> duplicate S.

I think ""SLUMP"" is better because it has distinct letters except for the S at the start? We are using S at 1 and then L, U, M, P. No duplicate.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we are putting S at position 1 and we know it's correct. So we are not testing anything about position 1? But we are using it to start the word.

We are using S at position 1, which is fixed, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we can use it to test other positions.

But we are also testing L at position 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know that position 4 in the first guess had S and it was wrong. Now we are putting M at position 4. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me check: are there any other words that start with S and use more common letters?

""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> we haven't tested U, L, K, Y.

""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> same as above but with M and P instead of K and Y.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""SLUMP"" because it has M and P, which are common.

So, the third guess: ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKS""? It has K and U, L. But we are using S at position 5? We are not: ""SULKS"" has S at position 1 and 5. We are not using S at position 5 in ""SLUMP"". ""SLUMP"" has S at 1 and then L, U, M, P.

So, to test if there is an S at position 5, we are not doing it in ""SLUMP"". But we can do it in a later guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that if we get an 'x' for S at position 5, then we know there is no second S. But we are not sure if there is a second S.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKY""? It has Y, which is less common. So ""SLUMP"" might be better.

Another word: ""SCUMP"" -> not a word.

""SLURP"": S, L, U, R, P -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). So not allowed.

""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""SLUMP"".

But note: we are not using S at position 5. If the secret word has S at position 5, then we won't know. But we can find out in the next guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 5 and also uses new letters. For example, ""SUSUS"" -> not a word and duplicate S.

""SWIRL"": but W, I, R -> I and R excluded.

""SYNCH"": but Y, N, C, H -> N and H are excluded.

So, ""SLUMP"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""SLUMP"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLUMP"" is valid.

So, the third guess is ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKS"", but I think ""SLUMP"" is better.

Another word: ""SLOSH"": but O and H excluded.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""slump"".

But note: we are using U and M, which are less common than some others. But we don't have many common letters left.

Common letters left: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We can try ""SULKY"" to test Y.

But I think ""SLUMP"" is fine.

So, I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  
  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  
  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **S** and has the following structure: `S _ _ _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for Guess 3**:  
  - Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., L, U, M, P, C, D) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid placing S in position 4 (since it's already known to be incorrect) and reuse S only in position 1 (to confirm its placement).  
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""SLUMP""
- **Why ""SLUMP""?**  
  - Starts with **S** (leveraging the known correct position).  
  - Uses new common letters: **L, U, M, P** (all untested and relatively frequent).  
  - Avoids excluded letters and position 4 for S.  
  - Tests positions 2–5 with four fresh letters, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.  

<guess>slump</guess>",slump,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- R, O, A, T are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with S.
- H, I, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with S.
- The word contains S (which we already knew) and now we know it's at position 1.
- The following letters are not in the word: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We have used the letters: R, O, A, S, T, H, I, N, E.

We know the word starts with S and has an S at position 1. The other letters are unknown.

We need to avoid the letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We also know that S is in the word and we now know its position (position 1). So we don't need to test S again? Actually, we can use S again? But note: we know S is in the word and at position 1, so we can use S at position 1 in every guess? But the rules don't say we can't. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 1 and then try to find the other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

So, the secret word is of the form: S _ _ _ _

We need to fill the next four positions with letters that are not in the set {R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E}.

We have to choose a word that starts with S and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: We have not used: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words that start with S and use the available letters.

Possible words:
- SLEEP: but E is excluded (from guess2: E(x)), so not allowed.
- SHINE: H and I and N and E are excluded, so not allowed.
- Other words: let's think of words starting with S and without the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

So, available: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try:
- SLEEPY? But that's 6 letters. No, must be 5 letters.
- SLIMY: S, L, I, M, Y -> but I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), so not allowed.
- SLICK: S, L, I, C, K -> I is excluded, so no.
- SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> U, M, P are available? Let's check: 
  - U is not excluded, M not excluded, P not excluded. But what about L? L is available.

But wait, we have to avoid I, so ""SLICK"" is invalid because of I.

Another word: ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available? U, L, K, Y are not excluded. So that's a candidate.

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but O is excluded (from guess1: O(x)), so no.

Another: ""SCULP"" -> not a common word.

Another: ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> but we have two S's? The word has S at position 1 and then S at position 5? But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are allowed to use S again? But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 5 to test? But we have to avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in this guess? In ""SULKS"", S is at position 1 and 5. We are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't say we can't. But the feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know that S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, then:
- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' or '-'? But if it has two S's, then it might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but in the wrong position, or '✓' if it's in the word and at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SULKS"" uses U, L, K, S. S is already known, so we are testing U, L, K.

But we have to consider that the word might have two S's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in the last position to avoid confusion? But we are allowed to test.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""SUDSY"": S, U, D, S, Y -> again, S at position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So if we put S at position 4, we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting S at position 4. Therefore, ""SUDSY"" is not good because it has S at position 4.

We should avoid putting S at position 4 because we know it's not there.

So, for the third guess, we should try to put S only at position 1 (since we know it's correct there) and avoid position 4. We can put S at other positions? But we don't know if there are multiple S's. However, we are not forced to put S only at position 1? But if we put S at another position, then we can check if there is a second S.

But we have to fill the blanks with letters that are not excluded.

Let me list possible words:

- ""SULKS"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K. But we are testing U, L, K. And we avoid the excluded letters.

- ""SULKY"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K, Y.

- ""SUDOR"": but O is excluded.

- ""SUGAR"": but A and R are excluded.

- ""SULKY"" and ""SULKS"" are both options.

But we also have other letters to test. We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses other common available letters, such as L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

For example:
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> but S at position 5? And we avoid position 4? Actually, we are putting S at position 5, which is fine. But we are also putting S at position 1 and 5. The word has two S's? We don't know. But we are testing L, U, M.

But note: we are using S at position 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 will be marked as 'x' (because the only S is at position 1 and it's already marked as ✓? But wait, the feedback for the first guess: we had only one S and it was at position 4 and got '-', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 and 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, then putting S at position 5 would be wrong and we should get an 'x' for that S. But we already have a ✓ for the S at position 1. So if we put S at position 5 and the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If the word has two S's, then we might get a '-' for the S at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. So it's acceptable.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can try.

However, we have to choose a word that is valid.

But let me think of words without duplicate S? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S again? But we know S is in the word, and we have it at position 1. We don't have to use S again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

We can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that we can test other letters.

For example, we can try a word that has S only at position 1 and then four new letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to find words starting with S and using four letters from the available set.

Common available letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Words:
- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available. Valid word.
- ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> has duplicate S.
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> duplicate S.
- ""SCULP"": not common.
- ""SUDOR"": O excluded.
- ""SUGAR"": A and R excluded.
- ""SULKY"" seems good.

But we also have ""SLYLY"": but Y is repeated and not common.

Another: ""SCAMP"": S, C, A, M, P -> A is excluded.

Another: ""SCOWL"": O and W? O is excluded.

Another: ""SKIMP"": S, K, I, M, P -> I is excluded.

Another: ""SLICK"": I excluded.

Another: ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all available? L, U, M, P are not excluded. So ""SLUMP"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKY"" is valid.

But ""SLUMP"" has S at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know position 4: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was misplaced. Now we are putting M at position 4? That's fine.

We can also try ""SPUMY"": S, P, U, M, Y -> all available? P, U, M, Y are not excluded. But ""SPUMY"" is a word? It means frothy, but it's not very common.

""SULKS"" is more common? But it has duplicate S.

I think ""SULKY"" is a good choice because it uses U, L, K, Y, which are common enough.

But we have to consider: we are testing U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.

We know position 4: we had S at 4 and it was wrong, but we don't know what is at position 4. So we are testing K at position 4? That's fine.

But note: we are not sure if the word has U, L, K, Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKY"" and if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have another option: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses letters that we haven't tested, such as C, D, U, M, P, etc.

For example, ""SCAMP"" is invalid because of A.

""SCUDS"": S, C, U, D, S -> duplicate S and S at position 5? But we are putting S at position 5. And C, U, D are available.

But ""SCUDS"" is a word? It means small waves, but not common.

""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> duplicate S, and P, U, D are available.

But we are putting S at position 5 again.

We can try ""SULKY"" or ""SULKS"" or ""SPUMY"".

But let me think of a word that has S at position 1 and then four new letters without duplicate.

How about ""SPLIT"": but P, L, I, T -> I and T are excluded.

""SCOLD"": O excluded.

""SCOUR"": O and R excluded.

""SCUFF"": S, C, U, F, F -> duplicate F? And F is available. But ""SCUFF"" is a word? It means to strike with the heel of the foot, but rare.

""SKIFF"": I excluded.

""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> duplicate K? And K is available.

But ""SKULK"" is a word.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SKULK"" has K, U, L, and S. S is already known. So it's valid.

But we are using K twice? Actually, it's S, K, U, L, K -> so two K's. Not ideal.

How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all distinct and available. Valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> duplicate S.

I think ""SLUMP"" is better because it has distinct letters except for the S at the start? We are using S at 1 and then L, U, M, P. No duplicate.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we are putting S at position 1 and we know it's correct. So we are not testing anything about position 1? But we are using it to start the word.

We are using S at position 1, which is fixed, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we can use it to test other positions.

But we are also testing L at position 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know that position 4 in the first guess had S and it was wrong. Now we are putting M at position 4. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me check: are there any other words that start with S and use more common letters?

""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> we haven't tested U, L, K, Y.

""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> same as above but with M and P instead of K and Y.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""SLUMP"" because it has M and P, which are common.

So, the third guess: ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKS""? It has K and U, L. But we are using S at position 5? We are not: ""SULKS"" has S at position 1 and 5. We are not using S at position 5 in ""SLUMP"". ""SLUMP"" has S at 1 and then L, U, M, P.

So, to test if there is an S at position 5, we are not doing it in ""SLUMP"". But we can do it in a later guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that if we get an 'x' for S at position 5, then we know there is no second S. But we are not sure if there is a second S.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKY""? It has Y, which is less common. So ""SLUMP"" might be better.

Another word: ""SCUMP"" -> not a word.

""SLURP"": S, L, U, R, P -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). So not allowed.

""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""SLUMP"".

But note: we are not using S at position 5. If the secret word has S at position 5, then we won't know. But we can find out in the next guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 5 and also uses new letters. For example, ""SUSUS"" -> not a word and duplicate S.

""SWIRL"": but W, I, R -> I and R excluded.

""SYNCH"": but Y, N, C, H -> N and H are excluded.

So, ""SLUMP"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""SLUMP"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLUMP"" is valid.

So, the third guess is ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKS"", but I think ""SLUMP"" is better.

Another word: ""SLOSH"": but O and H excluded.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""slump"".

But note: we are using U and M, which are less common than some others. But we don't have many common letters left.

Common letters left: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We can try ""SULKY"" to test Y.

But I think ""SLUMP"" is fine.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  
  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  
  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **S** and has the following structure: `S _ _ _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for Guess 3**:  
  - Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., L, U, M, P, C, D) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid placing S in position 4 (since it's already known to be incorrect) and reuse S only in position 1 (to confirm its placement).  
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""SLUMP""
- **Why ""SLUMP""?**  
  - Starts with **S** (leveraging the known correct position).  
  - Uses new common letters: **L, U, M, P** (all untested and relatively frequent).  
  - Avoids excluded letters and position 4 for S.  
  - Tests positions 2–5 with four fresh letters, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.",Guess 3: slump -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has three vowels and two common consonants. I'll go with ""ROAST"".

 R, O, A, S, T are all common letters. This might give us good information.

 So, my first guess is ""ROAST"".

<guess>roast</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""roast"":
 R: x (not in the word)
 O: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 S: - (in the word but wrong position)
 T: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter S is in the secret word, but not in the 4th position (since in ""roast"" it was at position 4 and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters R, O, A, T are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter S and does not contain R, O, A, T.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain R, O, A, T.
   - Contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position.

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 Since S is in the word, we can try to place S in a different position. Since it was in position 4 and that was wrong, we can try positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have to avoid R, O, A, T.

 Let's try to form a word that includes S and uses other common letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Possible common letters: E, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 We can try a word that has S in a different position, say position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5.

 Example words:
   - We could try ""SPINE"": but note that we have to avoid R, O, A, T. However, we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word. But wait, we haven't tried these.

 But note: we must include S and it cannot be in position 4. In ""SPINE"", S is in position 1.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So position 1 is a new position and might be correct.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has S in position 2, 3, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Let me think of a word that has S and uses common letters that we haven't tried: E, I, L, N, P, etc.

 Another idea: we can try ""LINES"" but that has 5 distinct letters? Actually, ""LINES"" is 5 letters: L, I, N, E, S. But note that S is at the end (position 5). Also, we avoid R, O, A, T.

 However, we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake of putting S in position 4? In ""LINES"", S is in position 5, which is different from 4.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess told us that S is in the word but not in position 4. It could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. So we can try position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 1 to see if it's there.

 However, we don't have any information about position 1, so we can try.

 But note: we have to use only letters that are not R, O, A, T.

 Let me list some words that have S and are 5 letters long, without R, O, A, T:

 - Using E, I, L, N, P: 
     ""SPINE"" -> S at position 1, then P, I, N, E.
     ""SLEEP"" -> but that has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. Also, we have S at position 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because we know that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was wrong. So we must avoid putting S at position 4.

     Actually, we must avoid position 4 for S? No, the feedback said that in the first guess S was at position 4 and it was present but misplaced, meaning that the secret word has S but not at position 4. So in the next guess, we can try S at a different position.

     But note: we are allowed to put S at position 4 again? However, we know it's not there because the feedback already told us that. So it would be a waste to put it again at 4. We should try a new position.

     So for the second guess, we should try S in a position that is not 4.

 Let me think of words with S in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We can try position 1: ""SPINE"", ""SLEEP"" (but that has two E's and we don't know if E is present) -> but we don't know about E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 2: for example, ""USING"" -> but that has U and I and S, but also G and N. But note: we haven't tried U, I, G, N.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""USING"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has S and also other common letters that we haven't tested, such as E, I, L, N, P, H, etc.

 Let me try to form a word that has S and as many new common letters as possible.

 Possibilities:
   - ""SPINE"": S at 1, then P, I, N, E. This covers P, I, N, E (all new) and S (which we know is present). But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters, but we don't have any information about duplicates.

   - ""SLEPT"": but T is not allowed (we know T is not in the word because it was marked x in the first guess). So we cannot use T.

   - ""SLEEP"": has two E's and we don't know if E is in the word. But we can try? However, we are allowed to try, but we might get less information because of the duplicate E.

   - ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E. This avoids R, O, A, T.

   - ""SPINE"" and ""SHINE"" are both options.

 But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but we can try.

 However, to maximize information, we might want to use distinct letters.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"": 
   - S at position 1 (which is a new position for S, so we can check if it's correct there)
   - Then H, I, N, E: which are all new letters.

 But wait, we know that S is in the word, so we are using that knowledge. Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PINES"": but that has S at the end (position 5) and P, I, N, E. But note: we don't know if P, I, N, E are in the word.

 However, we have to avoid R, O, A, T. ""PINES"" is valid.

 But let me think: we have only 6 tries, so we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""SLICE"" -> but L, I, C, E. However, we don't know about L, I, C, E. But note: we cannot use T, but L, I, C, E are allowed.

 However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""SLICE"" doesn't have these.

 But wait, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.

 Let me choose ""SLICE"": 
   - S at position 1? But we don't know if S is at position 1. We are trying to test S in a new position (position 1) because in the first guess it was at position 4 and was misplaced.

 However, note that the feedback for S was a '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So it could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

 We are trying S at position 1 in ""SLICE"". If we get a ✓ for S, then we know S is at position 1. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2, 3, or 5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know S is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for S.

 So let's go with ""SLICE"".

 But note: we are also testing L, I, C, E.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 However, I think ""SLICE"" is a good candidate.

 But wait, what about the fact that we know S is in the word? We are using that knowledge.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5? For example, ""PILES"" -> but that has two S's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.

 However, to keep it simple, let's try ""SLICE"".

 But note: we must avoid T, and ""SLICE"" does not have T.

 So I will go with ""SLICE"".

 However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLICE"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""SLICE"".

 But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven't tried and also uses more common letters. 

 Another candidate: ""SPINE"" (S at 1, then P, I, N, E) is also good.

 How about ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E.

 We can choose any of these.

 I think I'll go with ""SHINE"" because it has H which is a common consonant.

 But note: we have to avoid R, O, A, T. All these words do.

 Let me choose ""SHINE"".

 However, we are using S at position 1. If S is actually at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know S is at 2, 3, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.

 So, I'll guess ""SHINE"".

 But wait, what if the word has S at position 5? Then by putting S at position 1, we might get a '-' and then we know S is at 5. That would be good too.

 So either way, we get information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice.

 So, the guess is ""SHINE"".

 But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, N, E. We are testing them.

 Let me write the guess: SHINE.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.

 So, I'll go with ""SHINE"".

<guess>shine</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":
- R, O, A, T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").

For the second guess:
- Must include **S** (since it's in the word) but **not in position 4**.
- Must **avoid** R, O, A, T entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., E, I, L, N, H) to maximize information.

I chose **SHINE** because:
- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: H, I, N, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, O, A, T) and position 4 for S.

<guess>shine</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(x)
Guess 2: shine -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- R, O, A, T are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with S.
- H, I, N, E are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word starts with S.
- The word contains S (which we already knew) and now we know it's at position 1.
- The following letters are not in the word: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We have used the letters: R, O, A, S, T, H, I, N, E.

We know the word starts with S and has an S at position 1. The other letters are unknown.

We need to avoid the letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

We also know that S is in the word and we now know its position (position 1). So we don't need to test S again? Actually, we can use S again? But note: we know S is in the word and at position 1, so we can use S at position 1 in every guess? But the rules don't say we can't. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 1 and then try to find the other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess.

So, the secret word is of the form: S _ _ _ _

We need to fill the next four positions with letters that are not in the set {R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E}.

We have to choose a word that starts with S and uses only letters that are not excluded.

Available letters: We have not used: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

We can try to form words that start with S and use the available letters.

Possible words:
- SLEEP: but E is excluded (from guess2: E(x)), so not allowed.
- SHINE: H and I and N and E are excluded, so not allowed.
- Other words: let's think of words starting with S and without the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E.

So, available: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try:
- SLEEPY? But that's 6 letters. No, must be 5 letters.
- SLIMY: S, L, I, M, Y -> but I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), so not allowed.
- SLICK: S, L, I, C, K -> I is excluded, so no.
- SLUMP: S, L, U, M, P -> U, M, P are available? Let's check: 
  - U is not excluded, M not excluded, P not excluded. But what about L? L is available.

But wait, we have to avoid I, so ""SLICK"" is invalid because of I.

Another word: ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available? U, L, K, Y are not excluded. So that's a candidate.

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but O is excluded (from guess1: O(x)), so no.

Another: ""SCULP"" -> not a common word.

Another: ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> but we have two S's? The word has S at position 1 and then S at position 5? But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are allowed to use S again? But note: we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 5 to test? But we have to avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in this guess? In ""SULKS"", S is at position 1 and 5. We are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don't say we can't. But the feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know that S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, then:
- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' or '-'? But if it has two S's, then it might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but in the wrong position, or '✓' if it's in the word and at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SULKS"" uses U, L, K, S. S is already known, so we are testing U, L, K.

But we have to consider that the word might have two S's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in the last position to avoid confusion? But we are allowed to test.

But note: we have limited tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another word: ""SUDSY"": S, U, D, S, Y -> again, S at position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So if we put S at position 4, we know it's wrong. So we should avoid putting S at position 4. Therefore, ""SUDSY"" is not good because it has S at position 4.

We should avoid putting S at position 4 because we know it's not there.

So, for the third guess, we should try to put S only at position 1 (since we know it's correct there) and avoid position 4. We can put S at other positions? But we don't know if there are multiple S's. However, we are not forced to put S only at position 1? But if we put S at another position, then we can check if there is a second S.

But we have to fill the blanks with letters that are not excluded.

Let me list possible words:

- ""SULKS"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K. But we are testing U, L, K. And we avoid the excluded letters.

- ""SULKY"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K, Y.

- ""SUDOR"": but O is excluded.

- ""SUGAR"": but A and R are excluded.

- ""SULKY"" and ""SULKS"" are both options.

But we also have other letters to test. We want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses other common available letters, such as L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

For example:
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> but S at position 5? And we avoid position 4? Actually, we are putting S at position 5, which is fine. But we are also putting S at position 1 and 5. The word has two S's? We don't know. But we are testing L, U, M.

But note: we are using S at position 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 will be marked as 'x' (because the only S is at position 1 and it's already marked as ✓? But wait, the feedback for the first guess: we had only one S and it was at position 4 and got '-', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 and 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x' because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, then putting S at position 5 would be wrong and we should get an 'x' for that S. But we already have a ✓ for the S at position 1. So if we put S at position 5 and the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If the word has two S's, then we might get a '-' for the S at position 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. So it's acceptable.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can try.

However, we have to choose a word that is valid.

But let me think of words without duplicate S? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not.

Alternatively, we can avoid using S again? But we know S is in the word, and we have it at position 1. We don't have to use S again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.

We can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that we can test other letters.

For example, we can try a word that has S only at position 1 and then four new letters.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Let me try to find words starting with S and using four letters from the available set.

Common available letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Words:
- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available. Valid word.
- ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> has duplicate S.
- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> duplicate S.
- ""SCULP"": not common.
- ""SUDOR"": O excluded.
- ""SUGAR"": A and R excluded.
- ""SULKY"" seems good.

But we also have ""SLYLY"": but Y is repeated and not common.

Another: ""SCAMP"": S, C, A, M, P -> A is excluded.

Another: ""SCOWL"": O and W? O is excluded.

Another: ""SKIMP"": S, K, I, M, P -> I is excluded.

Another: ""SLICK"": I excluded.

Another: ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all available? L, U, M, P are not excluded. So ""SLUMP"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKY"" is valid.

But ""SLUMP"" has S at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know position 4: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was misplaced. Now we are putting M at position 4? That's fine.

We can also try ""SPUMY"": S, P, U, M, Y -> all available? P, U, M, Y are not excluded. But ""SPUMY"" is a word? It means frothy, but it's not very common.

""SULKS"" is more common? But it has duplicate S.

I think ""SULKY"" is a good choice because it uses U, L, K, Y, which are common enough.

But we have to consider: we are testing U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.

We know position 4: we had S at 4 and it was wrong, but we don't know what is at position 4. So we are testing K at position 4? That's fine.

But note: we are not sure if the word has U, L, K, Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKY"" and if we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we have another option: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses letters that we haven't tested, such as C, D, U, M, P, etc.

For example, ""SCAMP"" is invalid because of A.

""SCUDS"": S, C, U, D, S -> duplicate S and S at position 5? But we are putting S at position 5. And C, U, D are available.

But ""SCUDS"" is a word? It means small waves, but not common.

""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> duplicate S, and P, U, D are available.

But we are putting S at position 5 again.

We can try ""SULKY"" or ""SULKS"" or ""SPUMY"".

But let me think of a word that has S at position 1 and then four new letters without duplicate.

How about ""SPLIT"": but P, L, I, T -> I and T are excluded.

""SCOLD"": O excluded.

""SCOUR"": O and R excluded.

""SCUFF"": S, C, U, F, F -> duplicate F? And F is available. But ""SCUFF"" is a word? It means to strike with the heel of the foot, but rare.

""SKIFF"": I excluded.

""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> duplicate K? And K is available.

But ""SKULK"" is a word.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SKULK"" has K, U, L, and S. S is already known. So it's valid.

But we are using K twice? Actually, it's S, K, U, L, K -> so two K's. Not ideal.

How about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all distinct and available. Valid word.

Similarly, ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> duplicate S.

I think ""SLUMP"" is better because it has distinct letters except for the S at the start? We are using S at 1 and then L, U, M, P. No duplicate.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we are putting S at position 1 and we know it's correct. So we are not testing anything about position 1? But we are using it to start the word.

We are using S at position 1, which is fixed, so we don't need to test it again? Actually, we can use it to test other positions.

But we are also testing L at position 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.

We know that position 4 in the first guess had S and it was wrong. Now we are putting M at position 4. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me check: are there any other words that start with S and use more common letters?

""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> we haven't tested U, L, K, Y.

""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> same as above but with M and P instead of K and Y.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""SLUMP"" because it has M and P, which are common.

So, the third guess: ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKS""? It has K and U, L. But we are using S at position 5? We are not: ""SULKS"" has S at position 1 and 5. We are not using S at position 5 in ""SLUMP"". ""SLUMP"" has S at 1 and then L, U, M, P.

So, to test if there is an S at position 5, we are not doing it in ""SLUMP"". But we can do it in a later guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5, so that if we get an 'x' for S at position 5, then we know there is no second S. But we are not sure if there is a second S.

Given that we have limited guesses, it's better to test new letters.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P. All are allowed.

So, I'll go with ""SLUMP"".

But wait, what about ""SULKY""? It has Y, which is less common. So ""SLUMP"" might be better.

Another word: ""SCUMP"" -> not a word.

""SLURP"": S, L, U, R, P -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). So not allowed.

""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""SLUMP"".

But note: we are not using S at position 5. If the secret word has S at position 5, then we won't know. But we can find out in the next guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 5 and also uses new letters. For example, ""SUSUS"" -> not a word and duplicate S.

""SWIRL"": but W, I, R -> I and R excluded.

""SYNCH"": but Y, N, C, H -> N and H are excluded.

So, ""SLUMP"" seems a solid choice.

Therefore, I'll guess ""SLUMP"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLUMP"" is valid.

So, the third guess is ""SLUMP"".

But wait, we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try ""SULKS"", but I think ""SLUMP"" is better.

Another word: ""SLOSH"": but O and H excluded.

So, I think ""SLUMP"" is good.

So, the guess is ""slump"".

But note: we are using U and M, which are less common than some others. But we don't have many common letters left.

Common letters left: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

We can try ""SULKY"" to test Y.

But I think ""SLUMP"" is fine.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  
  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  
  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **S** and has the following structure: `S _ _ _ _`.
- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E (cannot appear in the word).
- **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for Guess 3**:  
  - Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., L, U, M, P, C, D) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid placing S in position 4 (since it's already known to be incorrect) and reuse S only in position 1 (to confirm its placement).  
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.  

### Chosen Guess: ""SLUMP""
- **Why ""SLUMP""?**  
  - Starts with **S** (leveraging the known correct position).  
  - Uses new common letters: **L, U, M, P** (all untested and relatively frequent).  
  - Avoids excluded letters and position 4 for S.  
  - Tests positions 2–5 with four fresh letters, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

However, we don\'t know about L, I, C, E. But note: we cannot use T, but L, I, C, E are allowed.\n\n However, we must avoid R, O, A, T. ""SLICE"" doesn\'t have these.\n\n But wait, we have to be cautious: the word must be valid.\n\n Let me choose ""SLICE"": \n   - S at position 1? But we don\'t know if S is at position 1. We are trying to test S in a new position (position 1) because in the first guess it was at position 4 and was misplaced.\n\n However, note that the feedback for S was a \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So it could be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5.\n\n We are trying S at position 1 in ""SLICE"". If we get a ✓ for S, then we know S is at position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know S is in the word but not at position 1 (so it must be at 2, 3, or 5). If we get an \'x\', that would be a contradiction because we know S is in the word. But we shouldn\'t get an \'x\' for S.\n\n So let\'s go with ""SLICE"".\n\n But note: we are also testing L, I, C, E.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n However, I think ""SLICE"" is a good candidate.\n\n But wait, what about the fact that we know S is in the word? We are using that knowledge.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5? For example, ""PILES"" -> but that has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. But we can try.\n\n However, to keep it simple, let\'s try ""SLICE"".\n\n But note: we must avoid T, and ""SLICE"" does not have T.\n\n So I will go with ""SLICE"".\n\n However, let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLICE"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, my second guess is ""SLICE"".\n\n But wait, what if the word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in a position that we haven\'t tried and also uses more common letters. \n\n Another candidate: ""SPINE"" (S at 1, then P, I, N, E) is also good.\n\n How about ""SHINE"": S at 1, then H, I, N, E.\n\n We can choose any of these.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""SHINE"" because it has H which is a common consonant.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, O, A, T. All these words do.\n\n Let me choose ""SHINE"".\n\n However, we are using S at position 1. If S is actually at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know S is at 2, 3, or 5.\n\n Also, we are testing H, I, N, E.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""SHINE"".\n\n But wait, what if the word has S at position 5? Then by putting S at position 1, we might get a \'-\' and then we know S is at 5. That would be good too.\n\n So either way, we get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n After considering, I think ""SHINE"" is a good choice.\n\n So, the guess is ""SHINE"".\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has H, I, N, E. We are testing them.\n\n Let me write the guess: SHINE.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But we are not using duplicates in this guess.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""SHINE"".\n\n<guess>shine</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""roast"":\n- R, O, A, T are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- S is in the word but **not in position 4** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include **S** (since it\'s in the word) but **not in position 4**.\n- Must **avoid** R, O, A, T entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., E, I, L, N, H) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **SHINE** because:\n- Places S in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: H, I, N, E.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (R, O, A, T) and position 4 for S.\n\n<guess>shine</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 2: shine -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- R, O, A, T are not in the word at all.\n- S is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

L is available.\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid I, so ""SLICK"" is invalid because of I.\n\nAnother word: ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available? U, L, K, Y are not excluded. So that\'s a candidate.\n\nBut is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPOIL"" -> but O is excluded (from guess1: O(x)), so no.\n\nAnother: ""SCULP"" -> not a common word.\n\nAnother: ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> but we have two S\'s? The word has S at position 1 and then S at position 5? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. However, we are allowed to use S again? But note: we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use S at position 5 to test? But we have to avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in this guess? In ""SULKS"", S is at position 1 and 5. We are allowed to use S multiple times? The rules don\'t say we can\'t. But the feedback might be tricky.\n\nBut note: we know that S is at position 1, so if we put S at position 5, then:\n- If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as \'x\' or \'-\'? But if it has two S\'s, then it might be marked as \'-\' if it\'s in the word but in the wrong position, or \'✓\' if it\'s in the word and at position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SULKS"" uses U, L, K, S. S is already known, so we are testing U, L, K.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have two S\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have S in the last position to avoid confusion? But we are allowed to test.\n\nBut note: we have limited tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\nAnother word: ""SUDSY"": S, U, D, S, Y -> again, S at position 1 and 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So if we put S at position 4, we know it\'s wrong. So we should avoid putting S at position 4. Therefore, ""SUDSY"" is not good because it has S at position 4.\n\nWe should avoid putting S at position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo, for the third guess, we should try to put S only at position 1 (since we know it\'s correct there) and avoid position 4. We can put S at other positions? But we don\'t know if there are multiple S\'s. However, we are not forced to put S only at position 1? But if we put S at another position, then we can check if there is a second S.\n\nBut we have to fill the blanks with letters that are not excluded.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""SULKS"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K. But we are testing U, L, K. And we avoid the excluded letters.\n\n- ""SULKY"": S at 1 and 5, and U, L, K, Y.\n\n- ""SUDOR"": but O is excluded.\n\n- ""SUGAR"": but A and R are excluded.\n\n- ""SULKY"" and ""SULKS"" are both options.\n\nBut we also have other letters to test. We want to cover more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses other common available letters, such as L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> but S at position 5? And we avoid position 4? Actually, we are putting S at position 5, which is fine. But we are also putting S at position 1 and 5. The word has two S\'s? We don\'t know. But we are testing L, U, M.\n\nBut note: we are using S at position 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 will be marked as \'x\' (because the only S is at position 1 and it\'s already marked as ✓? But wait, the feedback for the first guess: we had only one S and it was at position 4 and got \'-\', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 and 5. If the secret word has only one S, then the S at position 5 would be marked as \'x\' because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word, then each occurrence is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, then putting S at position 5 would be wrong and we should get an \'x\' for that S. But we already have a ✓ for the S at position 1. So if we put S at position 5 and the word has only one S, then we get an \'x\' for the S at position 5. If the word has two S\'s, then we might get a \'-\' for the S at position 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. So it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so we can try.\n\nHowever, we have to choose a word that is valid.\n\nBut let me think of words without duplicate S? Because duplicates might be less common? Or not.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using S again? But we know S is in the word, and we have it at position 1. We don\'t have to use S again? Actually, we can, but it might not be efficient.\n\nWe can try a word that doesn\'t have S at position 5, so that we can test other letters.\n\nFor example, we can try a word that has S only at position 1 and then four new letters.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nLet me try to find words starting with S and using four letters from the available set.\n\nCommon available letters: L, U, D, C, M, P, Y, etc.\n\nWords:\n- ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all available. Valid word.\n- ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> has duplicate S.\n- ""SLUMS"": S, L, U, M, S -> duplicate S.\n- ""SCULP"": not common.\n- ""SUDOR"": O excluded.\n- ""SUGAR"": A and R excluded.\n- ""SULKY"" seems good.\n\nBut we also have ""SLYLY"": but Y is repeated and not common.\n\nAnother: ""SCAMP"": S, C, A, M, P -> A is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SCOWL"": O and W? O is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SKIMP"": S, K, I, M, P -> I is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SLICK"": I excluded.\n\nAnother: ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all available? L, U, M, P are not excluded. So ""SLUMP"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SULKY"" is valid.\n\nBut ""SLUMP"" has S at 1, L at 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.\n\nWe know position 4: in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was misplaced. Now we are putting M at position 4? That\'s fine.\n\nWe can also try ""SPUMY"": S, P, U, M, Y -> all available? P, U, M, Y are not excluded. But ""SPUMY"" is a word? It means frothy, but it\'s not very common.\n\n""SULKS"" is more common? But it has duplicate S.\n\nI think ""SULKY"" is a good choice because it uses U, L, K, Y, which are common enough.\n\nBut we have to consider: we are testing U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.\n\nWe know position 4: we had S at 4 and it was wrong, but we don\'t know what is at position 4. So we are testing K at position 4? That\'s fine.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has U, L, K, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SULKY"" and if we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut we have another option: we can try a word that has S at position 1 and then uses letters that we haven\'t tested, such as C, D, U, M, P, etc.\n\nFor example, ""SCAMP"" is invalid because of A.\n\n""SCUDS"": S, C, U, D, S -> duplicate S and S at position 5? But we are putting S at position 5. And C, U, D are available.\n\nBut ""SCUDS"" is a word? It means small waves, but not common.\n\n""SPUDS"": S, P, U, D, S -> duplicate S, and P, U, D are available.\n\nBut we are putting S at position 5 again.\n\nWe can try ""SULKY"" or ""SULKS"" or ""SPUMY"".\n\nBut let me think of a word that has S at position 1 and then four new letters without duplicate.\n\nHow about ""SPLIT"": but P, L, I, T -> I and T are excluded.\n\n""SCOLD"": O excluded.\n\n""SCOUR"": O and R excluded.\n\n""SCUFF"": S, C, U, F, F -> duplicate F? And F is available. But ""SCUFF"" is a word? It means to strike with the heel of the foot, but rare.\n\n""SKIFF"": I excluded.\n\n""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> duplicate K? And K is available.\n\nBut ""SKULK"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SKULK"" has K, U, L, and S. S is already known. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut we are using K twice? Actually, it\'s S, K, U, L, K -> so two K\'s. Not ideal.\n\nHow about ""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> all distinct and available. Valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> duplicate S.\n\nI think ""SLUMP"" is better because it has distinct letters except for the S at the start? We are using S at 1 and then L, U, M, P. No duplicate.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut wait, we are putting S at position 1 and we know it\'s correct. So we are not testing anything about position 1? But we are using it to start the word.\n\nWe are using S at position 1, which is fixed, so we don\'t need to test it again? Actually, we can use it to test other positions.\n\nBut we are also testing L at position 2, U at 3, M at 4, P at 5.\n\nWe know that position 4 in the first guess had S and it was wrong. Now we are putting M at position 4. If M is in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: are there any other words that start with S and use more common letters?\n\n""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> we haven\'t tested U, L, K, Y.\n\n""SLUMP"": S, L, U, M, P -> same as above but with M and P instead of K and Y.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. Both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""SLUMP"" because it has M and P, which are common.\n\nSo, the third guess: ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SULKS""? It has K and U, L. But we are using S at position 5? We are not: ""SULKS"" has S at position 1 and 5. We are not using S at position 5 in ""SLUMP"". ""SLUMP"" has S at 1 and then L, U, M, P.\n\nSo, to test if there is an S at position 5, we are not doing it in ""SLUMP"". But we can do it in a later guess if needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have S at position 5, so that if we get an \'x\' for S at position 5, then we know there is no second S. But we are not sure if there is a second S.\n\nGiven that we have limited guesses, it\'s better to test new letters.\n\nSo, I think ""SLUMP"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""SLUMP"" uses S, L, U, M, P. All are allowed.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SULKY""? It has Y, which is less common. So ""SLUMP"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""SCUMP"" -> not a word.\n\n""SLURP"": S, L, U, R, P -> but R is excluded (from guess1: R(x)). So not allowed.\n\n""SLUMP"" is good.\n\nSo, the guess is ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut note: we are not using S at position 5. If the secret word has S at position 5, then we won\'t know. But we can find out in the next guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 5 and also uses new letters. For example, ""SUSUS"" -> not a word and duplicate S.\n\n""SWIRL"": but W, I, R -> I and R excluded.\n\n""SYNCH"": but Y, N, C, H -> N and H are excluded.\n\nSo, ""SLUMP"" seems a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SLUMP"" is valid.\n\nSo, the third guess is ""SLUMP"".\n\nBut wait, we have to output in the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SULKS"", but I think ""SLUMP"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""SLOSH"": but O and H excluded.\n\nSo, I think ""SLUMP"" is good.\n\nSo, the guess is ""slump"".\n\nBut note: we are using U and M, which are less common than some others. But we don\'t have many common letters left.\n\nCommon letters left: L, U, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try ""SULKY"" to test Y.\n\nBut I think ""SLUMP"" is fine.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  \n  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  \n  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word starts with **S** and has the following structure: `S _ _ _ _`.\n- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Strategy for Guess 3**:  \n  - Focus on testing new common letters (e.g., L, U, M, P, C, D) to maximize information.  \n  - Avoid placing S in position 4 (since it\'s already known to be incorrect) and reuse S only in position 1 (to confirm its placement).  \n  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to cover more ground.  \n\n### Chosen Guess: ""SLUMP""\n- **Why ""SLUMP""?**  \n  - Starts with **S** (leveraging the known correct position).  \n  - Uses new common letters: **L, U, M, P** (all untested and relatively frequent).  \n  - Avoids excluded letters and position 4 for S.  \n  - Tests positions 2–5 with four fresh letters, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>slump</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: roast -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(x) A(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 2: shine -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 3: slump -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) M(x) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)
  - R, O, A, T are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with S.
  - H, I, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""slump"" -> S(✓), L(✓), U(✓), M(x), P(x)
  - S is correct at position 1 (already known).
  - L is correct at position 2.
  - U is correct at position 3.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - P is not in the word (x).

So, we now know:
- The secret word is of the form: S L U _ _
- The first three letters are S, L, U in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not M, P, H, I, N, E, R, O, A, T (from the x's in previous guesses).

We have used the letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, S, L, U, M, P.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SLU"" and the last two letters are from the available set.

The word pattern: S L U _ _

We need to fill the 4th and 5th positions.

Possible words that start with ""SLU"" and are 5 letters:

- We can try to think of common words: 
  - ""SLUMS"" -> but M is excluded (from guess3: M(x)), so not allowed.
  - ""SLUSH"" -> but H is excluded (from guess2: H(x)), so not allowed.
  - ""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.
  - ""SLURB"" -> not a common word? And B is available, but let's see.
  - ""SLUDE"" -> E excluded.
  - ""SLUDD"" -> not a word.
  - ""SLUGS"" -> G and S: S is already known, but we can use it? However, we are trying to find new letters. But note: we know S is in the word, but we have it at position 1. We don't know if there is another S. But we are avoiding position 4 for S (from first guess). So we cannot put S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in these guesses? We are not.

But in the pattern, we are only filling positions 4 and 5.

We can try words like:
- ""SLUBS"" -> but S at position 5? And we have S at position 1. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, B is available. But ""SLUBS"" has S at position 5. However, we are not allowed to put S at position 4? We are not. But in this word, position 4 is B and position 5 is S. So we are not putting S at position 4.

But we are putting S at position 5. If the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If it has two S's, then we might get a '-' for position 5 if the other S is elsewhere? But we don't know.

But we are not sure. We can try.

However, we have to use only available letters.

Available letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to form words:

- ""SLUCC"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUDS"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUFF"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUGS"" -> S at position 5? And we have G and S. But we are using S again? We can, but we might not be testing new letters. However, we are testing G.

But we don't know if G is in the word.

Another word: ""SLUDE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUKE"" -> not a word.

""SLUMS"" -> M excluded.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURB"" -> not common, but let's check: ""slurp"" is a word, but that has R and P which are excluded.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

What about ""SLUDD""? Not a word.

""SLUFF"" Not a word.

""SLUGS"": S, L, U, G, S -> but we are putting S at position 5. And G is available. But note: we are using S at position 5. If the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If it has two S's, then we might get a '-' for position 5.

But we are also testing G at position 4.

Another word: ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> again, S at position 5 and B at 4. But we are testing B.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider words that don't have S at position 5? But we don't know if there is an S at position 5. We have to test.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we have many available letters.

We can try ""SLUCC"" but not a word.

""SLUED"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFF"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" is a word: meaning sulky or pouty. But it has two S's? S at 1 and 5, and G at 4.

But we are testing G and also testing if there is an S at position 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLUKE"" -> not a word.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURB"" -> not standard.

Another idea: ""SLUDE"" is not possible because of E.

What about ""SLUDD""? Not a word.

""SLUFF"" Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider words that don't have S at position 5? Because we haven't tested that position.

For example, we can try a word that has a different letter at position 5 and a different letter at position 4.

We have available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try:

- ""SLUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.

- ""SLUC"" not a word.

- ""SLUD"" not 5 letters.

We need 5 letters.

How about ""SLUKE""? Not a word.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUDD"" -> not a word.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can think of that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

But ""SLUGS"" has S at position 5. We are testing G at position 4 and S at position 5.

But we already know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and it's not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is in the word, we get a '-'.

But we are also testing G at position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""SLUAN"" -> but A is excluded.

""SLUMB"" -> not a word.

""SLURB"" -> not standard.

Perhaps ""SLUSH"" but H is excluded.

I think ""SLUGS"" is the best option, even though it has duplicate S.

But let me check if there are other words.

What about ""SLUKE""? Not a word.

""SLUFE"" -> no.

""SLUDD"" -> no.

""SLUFF"" -> no.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can find.

But wait, what about ""SLUMP""? We already tried that, and it had M and P which are excluded now.

In guess3, we had ""slump"" and M and P were x, so they are not in the word.

So, we cannot use M or P.

Therefore, ""SLUGS"" is a candidate.

But let me see: the word is ""SLUGS"". 

Pattern: S L U G S

We are testing:
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: S

We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. Similarly, G is new.

But we are using S at position 5, which we haven't tested before.

We can also consider ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> but that has S at position 5 and B at 4. And duplicate S.

Both are valid.

But ""SLUGS"" is more common.

Another word: ""SLUKE"" is not a word.

""SLURP"" is a word but has R and P which are excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the best choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. ""SLUGS"" has S, L, U, G, S. The excluded letters are R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P. G is not excluded, so it's okay.

Also, S is at position 1 and 5. We know position 1 is S, so we are testing position 5 for S.

If we get a ✓ for the S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 5 (so it must be at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S, and we have only positions 4 and 5 left. But if S is not at 5, then it must be at 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So that would be a contradiction? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5, and we know S is not at 4 (from first guess). So if the word has only one S, then it cannot be at position 4 or 5. But we know it's at position 1, so if it's not at 4 or 5, then it must not be at 4? But we know it's not at 4 from the first guess. So that would be impossible. Therefore, the word must have two S's? Or maybe we have a duplicate S? 

But the first guess had S at position 4 and it was present but misplaced. Now we have S at position 1 (correct) and if we put S at position 5, then:

- If the word has only one S, then position 5 should be marked as 'x' (because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence independently. But if the word has only one S, then the S at position 1 is already used, so the S at position 5 would be 'x'. 

- If the word has two S's, then the S at position 5 could be '-' if it's in the word but not at position 5, or '✓' if it is at position 5.

But we know the word has at least one S (at position 1). If it has two S's, then we don't know yet.

But in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was '-', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 (correct) and if we put S at position 5, then:

- If the word has only one S, then position 5 is 'x'.
- If the word has two S's, then position 5 could be '-' (if the other S is at position 2,3, or 1? But position 1 is S, so not) or '✓' if it's at position 5.

But position 1 is S, so if the word has two S's, then the S at position 5 can only be correct if the secret word has S at position 5. Otherwise, if the secret word has S only at position 1, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x'.

So, by putting S at position 5, we can determine if there is a second S.

Therefore, we can try ""SLUGS"".

But we are also testing G at position 4.

So, let's go with ""SLUGS"".

But wait, what about ""SLUCC""? Not a word.

Or ""SLUDS"" -> not a word.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can find.

Another possibility: ""SLUFE"" is not allowed because of E.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is our best bet.

But let me double-check: the secret word is S L U _ _, and we need two letters for positions 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> which is a word (meaning sulky). And it has B at position 4 and S at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLUGS"" has G at 4 and S at 5.

Both are valid.

But ""SLUBS"" uses B, which is more common than G? In wordle, B is more common than G? Actually, in wordle, common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z.

But we have excluded many, so B and G are both available.

But we are testing different letters.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel? But the vowels we have are U (already in position 3) and we haven't tested Y. Y is available.

For example, ""SLUY"" is not 5 letters.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

""SLUFE"" not allowed.

""SLUDD"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" and ""SLUBS"" are the main options.

But ""SLUBS"" has B, which is more common than G? In English, B is more common than G.

But we are in a wordle game, and we need to solve.

Another word: ""SLUFF"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with Y.

For example, ""SLUYS"" -> not a word.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

""SLURB"" not standard.

So, I think we should go with ""SLUGS"".

But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about ""SLUAN""? A excluded.

""SLUIN"" -> I and N excluded.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the word.

But note: we are using S at position 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. If we get a ✓ for the S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4? But position 4 is the only other possibility? Because positions 1,2,3 are fixed.

The secret word is S L U _ _, so positions 4 and 5 are open.

If we put S at position 5 and get a '-', then S must be at position 4? But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. So that would be a contradiction. Therefore, if the word has only one S, then position 5 cannot be S. If the word has two S's, then position 5 could be S.

But if we get a '-' for S at position 5, then we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4. But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. This would be a contradiction because if S is at position 4, then in the first guess when we had S at position 4, it should have been ✓, but it was '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So that means the word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, if we get a '-' for S at position 5, then the word must have S at position 4? But that's impossible because of the first guess. So the only possibility is that the word has two S's? 

But let's think: the first guess had S at position 4 and got '-', meaning there is an S but not at position 4. The secret word has S at position 1. If the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in the first guess was not at the correct position, but there is another S at position 4? That would be a contradiction because if there is an S at position 4, then the first guess should have gotten a ✓ for position 4. But it didn't, it got '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So the secret word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, the word must have two S's? 

But that would mean the word has S at position 1 and position 5? Then in the first guess, when we had S at position 4, it was not present? No, the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so there is an S. But if the word has S at position 1 and 5, then the S at position 4 in the first guess is not at position 4, but there is an S at position 5? Then the S at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? But it was, so that matches. However, the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word but not at position 4. It doesn't tell us about position 5. So it could be that the word has S at position 1 and position 5, and the first guess's S at position 4 is not the same S? Then it should be marked as not present? But it was marked as present, so it must be that the word has an S at position 5, and the first guess's S at position 4 is not at position 4, but there is an S at position 5. So the S at position 4 in the first guess is a different S? Then it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. So that is consistent.

But in the second guess, we had S at position 1 (correct) and no other S. In the third guess, we had S at position 1 (correct) and no other S. In the fourth guess, we are about to make, we have S at position 1 (correct) and we are putting S at position 5.

So, if the word has two S's, then we should get a '-' for the S at position 5. If it has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have two S's. The alternative is that position 4 is S? But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. So that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the word has two S's: one at position 1 and one at position 5? Or one at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S, so it must be at position 5.

But what if the word has S at position 4? We know it doesn't because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So the word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, the only position for a second S is position 5.

So, we are hoping that the word has two S's.

But we are not sure. We can try ""SLUGS"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another word: ""SLUKE"" is not a word.

""SLURB"" not standard.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm: ""SLUGS"" is a word.

So, we'll guess ""SLUGS"".

But note: we are testing G at position 4 and S at position 5.

If we get a ✓ for S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S.

If we get a '-' for S at position 5, then we know S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4. But we know position 4 is not S, so that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the word must have two S's? 

But if the word has two S's, then position 5 could be S.

If we get a '-' for S at position 5, then we know S is at position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which we haven't filled. But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So if S is at position 4, then in the first guess, when we had S at position 4, it should have been ✓, but it was '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So that's impossible. Therefore, the word must have two S's, and one of them is at position 5.

So, we can rely on that.

Therefore, we guess ""SLUGS"".

But we have to output the guess.

So, the fourth guess is ""SLUGS"".

But let me write it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""SLUCC"" is not a word.

""SLUED"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUGS"" is the best.

So, I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  
  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  
  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""slump""** → S(✓), L(✓), U(✓), M(x), P(x)  
  - **S** is confirmed at position 1 (already known).  
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - **U** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 3**.  
  - **M** and **P** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **SLU** (positions 1–3 confirmed).  
- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P (cannot appear).  
- **Available letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Pattern**: `S L U _ _`.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - The word must be a valid 5-letter word starting with ""SLU"".  
  - Focus on testing common letters from the available set (e.g., B, G, C, D, F) for positions 4 and 5.  
  - Given the constraints, **""SLUGS""** is the strongest guess:  
    - It tests **G** at position 4 and **S** at position 5.  
    - S is already confirmed at position 1, so position 5 testing S (will reveal if duplicate S exists).  
    - G is a common letter worth testing.  
  - Alternatives like ""SLUBS"" (uses B) were considered, but ""SLUGS"" is more common and efficiently tests two new letters (G and the possibility of a second S).  

### Chosen Guess: ""SLUGS""
- **Why ""SLUGS""?**  
  - Confirms if **S** appears again (and if so, its position).  
  - Tests **G** at position 4 (a new letter).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters and reuses S only in position 1 (as it's confirmed correct).  

<guess>slugs</guess>",slugs,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""roast"" -> R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)
  - R, O, A, T are not in the word.
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: ""shine"" -> S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)
  - S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the secret word starts with S.
  - H, I, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""slump"" -> S(✓), L(✓), U(✓), M(x), P(x)
  - S is correct at position 1 (already known).
  - L is correct at position 2.
  - U is correct at position 3.
  - M is not in the word (x).
  - P is not in the word (x).

So, we now know:
- The secret word is of the form: S L U _ _
- The first three letters are S, L, U in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- The last two letters are unknown, but we know they are not M, P, H, I, N, E, R, O, A, T (from the x's in previous guesses).

We have used the letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, S, L, U, M, P.

Excluded letters: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SLU"" and the last two letters are from the available set.

The word pattern: S L U _ _

We need to fill the 4th and 5th positions.

Possible words that start with ""SLU"" and are 5 letters:

- We can try to think of common words: 
  - ""SLUMS"" -> but M is excluded (from guess3: M(x)), so not allowed.
  - ""SLUSH"" -> but H is excluded (from guess2: H(x)), so not allowed.
  - ""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.
  - ""SLURB"" -> not a common word? And B is available, but let's see.
  - ""SLUDE"" -> E excluded.
  - ""SLUDD"" -> not a word.
  - ""SLUGS"" -> G and S: S is already known, but we can use it? However, we are trying to find new letters. But note: we know S is in the word, but we have it at position 1. We don't know if there is another S. But we are avoiding position 4 for S (from first guess). So we cannot put S at position 4? Actually, we are not putting S at position 4 in these guesses? We are not.

But in the pattern, we are only filling positions 4 and 5.

We can try words like:
- ""SLUBS"" -> but S at position 5? And we have S at position 1. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, B is available. But ""SLUBS"" has S at position 5. However, we are not allowed to put S at position 4? We are not. But in this word, position 4 is B and position 5 is S. So we are not putting S at position 4.

But we are putting S at position 5. If the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If it has two S's, then we might get a '-' for position 5 if the other S is elsewhere? But we don't know.

But we are not sure. We can try.

However, we have to use only available letters.

Available letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to form words:

- ""SLUCC"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUDS"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUFF"" -> not a word.
- ""SLUGS"" -> S at position 5? And we have G and S. But we are using S again? We can, but we might not be testing new letters. However, we are testing G.

But we don't know if G is in the word.

Another word: ""SLUDE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUKE"" -> not a word.

""SLUMS"" -> M excluded.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURB"" -> not common, but let's check: ""slurp"" is a word, but that has R and P which are excluded.

We need to avoid excluded letters.

What about ""SLUDD""? Not a word.

""SLUFF"" Not a word.

""SLUGS"": S, L, U, G, S -> but we are putting S at position 5. And G is available. But note: we are using S at position 5. If the word has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5. If it has two S's, then we might get a '-' for position 5.

But we are also testing G at position 4.

Another word: ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> again, S at position 5 and B at 4. But we are testing B.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider words that don't have S at position 5? But we don't know if there is an S at position 5. We have to test.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we have many available letters.

We can try ""SLUCC"" but not a word.

""SLUED"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFF"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" is a word: meaning sulky or pouty. But it has two S's? S at 1 and 5, and G at 4.

But we are testing G and also testing if there is an S at position 5.

Alternatively, we can try ""SLUKE"" -> not a word.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURB"" -> not standard.

Another idea: ""SLUDE"" is not possible because of E.

What about ""SLUDD""? Not a word.

""SLUFF"" Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider words that don't have S at position 5? Because we haven't tested that position.

For example, we can try a word that has a different letter at position 5 and a different letter at position 4.

We have available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try:

- ""SLUB"" is 4 letters, not 5.

- ""SLUC"" not a word.

- ""SLUD"" not 5 letters.

We need 5 letters.

How about ""SLUKE""? Not a word.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUDD"" -> not a word.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can think of that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

But ""SLUGS"" has S at position 5. We are testing G at position 4 and S at position 5.

But we already know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and it's not in the word, we get an 'x'. If it is in the word, we get a '-'.

But we are also testing G at position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""SLUAN"" -> but A is excluded.

""SLUMB"" -> not a word.

""SLURB"" -> not standard.

Perhaps ""SLUSH"" but H is excluded.

I think ""SLUGS"" is the best option, even though it has duplicate S.

But let me check if there are other words.

What about ""SLUKE""? Not a word.

""SLUFE"" -> no.

""SLUDD"" -> no.

""SLUFF"" -> no.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can find.

But wait, what about ""SLUMP""? We already tried that, and it had M and P which are excluded now.

In guess3, we had ""slump"" and M and P were x, so they are not in the word.

So, we cannot use M or P.

Therefore, ""SLUGS"" is a candidate.

But let me see: the word is ""SLUGS"". 

Pattern: S L U G S

We are testing:
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: S

We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. Similarly, G is new.

But we are using S at position 5, which we haven't tested before.

We can also consider ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> but that has S at position 5 and B at 4. And duplicate S.

Both are valid.

But ""SLUGS"" is more common.

Another word: ""SLUKE"" is not a word.

""SLURP"" is a word but has R and P which are excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the best choice.

But we have to make sure that we are not using any excluded letters. ""SLUGS"" has S, L, U, G, S. The excluded letters are R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P. G is not excluded, so it's okay.

Also, S is at position 1 and 5. We know position 1 is S, so we are testing position 5 for S.

If we get a ✓ for the S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 5 (so it must be at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S, and we have only positions 4 and 5 left. But if S is not at 5, then it must be at 4? But we know position 4 is not S (from first guess). So that would be a contradiction? Because the only positions left are 4 and 5, and we know S is not at 4 (from first guess). So if the word has only one S, then it cannot be at position 4 or 5. But we know it's at position 1, so if it's not at 4 or 5, then it must not be at 4? But we know it's not at 4 from the first guess. So that would be impossible. Therefore, the word must have two S's? Or maybe we have a duplicate S? 

But the first guess had S at position 4 and it was present but misplaced. Now we have S at position 1 (correct) and if we put S at position 5, then:

- If the word has only one S, then position 5 should be marked as 'x' (because the S is already used at position 1? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence independently. But if the word has only one S, then the S at position 1 is already used, so the S at position 5 would be 'x'. 

- If the word has two S's, then the S at position 5 could be '-' if it's in the word but not at position 5, or '✓' if it is at position 5.

But we know the word has at least one S (at position 1). If it has two S's, then we don't know yet.

But in the first guess, we had S at position 4 and it was '-', meaning there is an S but not at 4. Now we have S at position 1 (correct) and if we put S at position 5, then:

- If the word has only one S, then position 5 is 'x'.
- If the word has two S's, then position 5 could be '-' (if the other S is at position 2,3, or 1? But position 1 is S, so not) or '✓' if it's at position 5.

But position 1 is S, so if the word has two S's, then the S at position 5 can only be correct if the secret word has S at position 5. Otherwise, if the secret word has S only at position 1, then the S at position 5 would be marked as 'x'.

So, by putting S at position 5, we can determine if there is a second S.

Therefore, we can try ""SLUGS"".

But we are also testing G at position 4.

So, let's go with ""SLUGS"".

But wait, what about ""SLUCC""? Not a word.

Or ""SLUDS"" -> not a word.

""SLUGS"" is the only common word I can find.

Another possibility: ""SLUFE"" is not allowed because of E.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is our best bet.

But let me double-check: the secret word is S L U _ _, and we need two letters for positions 4 and 5.

We can also consider ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> which is a word (meaning sulky). And it has B at position 4 and S at position 5.

Similarly, ""SLUGS"" has G at 4 and S at 5.

Both are valid.

But ""SLUBS"" uses B, which is more common than G? In wordle, B is more common than G? Actually, in wordle, common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z.

But we have excluded many, so B and G are both available.

But we are testing different letters.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel? But the vowels we have are U (already in position 3) and we haven't tested Y. Y is available.

For example, ""SLUY"" is not 5 letters.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

""SLUFE"" not allowed.

""SLUDD"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" and ""SLUBS"" are the main options.

But ""SLUBS"" has B, which is more common than G? In English, B is more common than G.

But we are in a wordle game, and we need to solve.

Another word: ""SLUFF"" not a word.

""SLUGS"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with Y.

For example, ""SLUYS"" -> not a word.

""SLUKE"" not a word.

""SLURB"" not standard.

So, I think we should go with ""SLUGS"".

But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

What about ""SLUAN""? A excluded.

""SLUIN"" -> I and N excluded.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the word.

But note: we are using S at position 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 5. If we get a ✓ for the S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S. If we get a '-', then we know S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4? But position 4 is the only other possibility? Because positions 1,2,3 are fixed.

The secret word is S L U _ _, so positions 4 and 5 are open.

If we put S at position 5 and get a '-', then S must be at position 4? But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. So that would be a contradiction. Therefore, if the word has only one S, then position 5 cannot be S. If the word has two S's, then position 5 could be S.

But if we get a '-' for S at position 5, then we know that S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4. But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. This would be a contradiction because if S is at position 4, then in the first guess when we had S at position 4, it should have been ✓, but it was '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So that means the word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, if we get a '-' for S at position 5, then the word must have S at position 4? But that's impossible because of the first guess. So the only possibility is that the word has two S's? 

But let's think: the first guess had S at position 4 and got '-', meaning there is an S but not at position 4. The secret word has S at position 1. If the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in the first guess was not at the correct position, but there is another S at position 4? That would be a contradiction because if there is an S at position 4, then the first guess should have gotten a ✓ for position 4. But it didn't, it got '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So the secret word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, the word must have two S's? 

But that would mean the word has S at position 1 and position 5? Then in the first guess, when we had S at position 4, it was not present? No, the first guess had S at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position, so there is an S. But if the word has S at position 1 and 5, then the S at position 4 in the first guess is not at position 4, but there is an S at position 5? Then the S at position 4 should be marked as present but wrong position? But it was, so that matches. However, the feedback for the first guess said S is in the word but not at position 4. It doesn't tell us about position 5. So it could be that the word has S at position 1 and position 5, and the first guess's S at position 4 is not the same S? Then it should be marked as not present? But it was marked as present, so it must be that the word has an S at position 5, and the first guess's S at position 4 is not at position 4, but there is an S at position 5. So the S at position 4 in the first guess is a different S? Then it should be marked as present but wrong position, which it was. So that is consistent.

But in the second guess, we had S at position 1 (correct) and no other S. In the third guess, we had S at position 1 (correct) and no other S. In the fourth guess, we are about to make, we have S at position 1 (correct) and we are putting S at position 5.

So, if the word has two S's, then we should get a '-' for the S at position 5. If it has only one S, then we get an 'x' for the S at position 5.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might not have two S's. The alternative is that position 4 is S? But we know from the first guess that position 4 is not S. So that's impossible.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the word has two S's: one at position 1 and one at position 5? Or one at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S, so it must be at position 5.

But what if the word has S at position 4? We know it doesn't because the first guess had S at position 4 and it was '-', meaning it's not at position 4. So the word does not have S at position 4. Therefore, the only position for a second S is position 5.

So, we are hoping that the word has two S's.

But we are not sure. We can try ""SLUGS"" to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Another word: ""SLUKE"" is not a word.

""SLURB"" not standard.

""SLUSH"" -> H excluded.

""SLURP"" -> R and P excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

So, I think ""SLUGS"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me confirm: ""SLUGS"" is a word.

So, we'll guess ""SLUGS"".

But note: we are testing G at position 4 and S at position 5.

If we get a ✓ for S at position 5, then we know the word ends with S.

If we get a '-' for S at position 5, then we know S is in the word but not at position 5, so it must be at position 4. But we know position 4 is not S, so that would be a contradiction. Therefore, the word must have two S's?

Therefore, the word must have two S's, and one of them is at position 5.

So, we can rely on that.

Therefore, we guess ""SLUGS"".

But we have to output the guess.

So, the fourth guess is ""SLUGS"".

But let me write it.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S at position 5? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""SLUCC"" is not a word.

""SLUED"" -> E excluded.

""SLUFE"" -> E excluded.

""SLUGS"" is the best.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""roast""** → R(x), O(x), A(x), S(-), T(x)  
  - **R, O, A, T** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.  

- **Guess 2: ""shine""** → S(✓), H(x), I(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - **S** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 1** (so the secret word starts with S).  
  - **H, I, N, E** are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 3: ""slump""** → S(✓), L(✓), U(✓), M(x), P(x)  
  - **S** is confirmed at position 1 (already known).  
  - **L** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
  - **U** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 3**.  
  - **M** and **P** are **not** in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word starts with **SLU** (positions 1–3 confirmed).  
- **Excluded letters**: R, O, A, T, H, I, N, E, M, P (cannot appear).  
- **Available letters for positions 4 and 5**: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
- **Pattern**: `S L U _ _`.  
- **Strategy for Guess 4**:  
  - The word must be a valid 5-letter word starting with ""SLU"".  
  - Focus on testing common letters from the available set (e.g., B, G, C, D, F) for positions 4 and 5.  
  - Given the constraints, **""SLUGS""** is the strongest guess:  
    - It tests **G** at position 4 and **S** at position 5.  
    - S is already confirmed at position 1, so position 5 testing S (will reveal if duplicate S exists).  
    - G is a common letter worth testing.  
  - Alternatives like ""SLUBS"" (uses B) were considered, but ""SLUGS"" is more common and efficiently tests two new letters (G and the possibility of a second S).  

### Chosen Guess: ""SLUGS""
- **Why ""SLUGS""?**  
  - Confirms if **S** appears again (and if so, its position).  
  - Tests **G** at position 4 (a new letter).  
  - Avoids all excluded letters and reuses S only in position 1 (as it's confirmed correct).",Guess 4: slugs -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(✓) U(✓) G(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
