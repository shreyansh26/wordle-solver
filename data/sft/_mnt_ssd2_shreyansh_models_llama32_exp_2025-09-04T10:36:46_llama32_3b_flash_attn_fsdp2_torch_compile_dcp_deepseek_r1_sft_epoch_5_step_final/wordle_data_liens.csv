We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- An N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- The letter E is present, but not in the 5th position. So it must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or A.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position, so we can try it in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to test.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ _ N _
- With E in one of the first three positions.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ N _
- Position 2: _ E _ N _
- Position 3: _ _ E N _

We should also try to include other common consonants to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent: C, R, A.

Let me try to come up with a word that has N in the 4th position and E in a different position, and includes other common letters.

Option 1: Put E in the first position: E _ _ N _
We need to fill the second and third positions with letters that are not C, R, A, and are common.

Possible words: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has C and J is not common? Also, we know C is absent, so no.
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but we need N in the 4th? No, the 4th is O? Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words ending with N? But wait, the 4th is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _.

So for E in position 1: E _ _ N _

Possible words:
- ""EATEN"" -> but E is in position 1 and 5? We know A is absent, so no.
- ""EXCEL"" -> has C and X, and also C is absent? No.
- ""EDEN"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word? 
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

Perhaps E in position 2: _ E _ N _

Words:
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N, but the 4th letter is I? No, we need the 4th to be N. So the pattern is _ E _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and 5th is something.

In ""BEGIN"", the letters are: B (1), E (2), G (3), I (4), N (5). So the 4th is I and 5th is N? That doesn't match because we need the 4th to be N.

We need the 4th to be N, so the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for _ E _ N _:
- The first letter: ?
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: ?
- Fourth letter: N
- Fifth letter: ?

So the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

We know E is in the word, but not in the 5th position. We are putting it in the 2nd.

Possible words:
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N, but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N? Actually, the 4th is O and 5th is N? That's not the same as having N in the 4th.

Wait, let me clarify the positions:
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 2: second letter
- Position 3: third letter
- Position 4: fourth letter (which is N)
- Position 5: fifth letter

So for a word with E in the second position and N in the fourth: the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

For example, ""SENT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Possible words:
- ""SENT"" is 4, so not.
- ""SENTN"" is not a word.

Actually, common words:
- ""LEMON"" -> L E M O N -> but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N. So the 4th is not N.

I need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.

For example:
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So let's try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).

Pattern: ? E ? N ?

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.

- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.

- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.

But we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.

Also, we are using B, I, G. We don't know about these letters.

But note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.

Also, we are testing B, I, G.

But we must avoid A, C, R.

""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.

N is in the 4th position, which is correct.

E is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.

We also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.

Another possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.

""SENT"" is too short.

""LEMON"" -> same issue.

""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

So the word must be: ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?

Words:
- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

""EDEN"" is 4 letters.

""EXCON"" -> not a word.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:

Position 1: first letter
Position 2: second letter
Position 3: third letter
Position 4: fourth letter = N
Position 5: fifth letter

So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]

We need a word: E ? ? N ?

Examples:
- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.
- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

Words:
- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.
- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.

We need the 4th to be N.

So [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.

So the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.

So for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.

- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.

- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

I see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

And E must be in one of the first three positions.

So for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

What words fit this?
- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.
- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.

In ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Common words: 
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.

- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.

- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.

- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.

But we have E to include? We don't have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.

We should include E to test its position.

So we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).

Let me list words with N in the 4th position.

For example:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Another example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.

""IRON"" is 4 letters.

""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So let's think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

For example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.

""LLANO"" -> not a common word.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.

I think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.

Another idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

I see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.

Without A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.

But ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.

So for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.

""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] are not E? We don't know, but we can have other letters.

For example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.

""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Let me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So the word is: ... N ?

Like in ""URBAN"", but U R B A N -> R and A absent.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> A absent.

""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No.

""CONIC"" -> C is absent.

""LOGIC"" -> C absent.

""TOPIC"" -> C absent.

""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E, not N.

""AXION"" -> A absent.

""OPIUM"" -> no E.

I'm struggling.

Perhaps E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]

[1] and [3] and [5] must be filled, and [5] cannot be E.

Examples:
- ""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.
- ""BEING"" -> 4th is I.
- ""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.
- ""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""SENT"" is 4 letters.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R is absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> T E P E E -> 4th is E, 5th is E.

But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need the 5th to be something else.

What about ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""BEVY"" is 4 letters.

I think I need to consider that the word might have E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] and [5] are not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""BLUNT"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me think: ""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCENE"" -> S C E N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] are not E, and [5] is not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> no E.
- ""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.
- ""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.
- ""SPINE"" -> has E in 5th.
- ""SHINE"" -> has E in 5th.

What about ""DEMON""? No, 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

I found one: ""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E -> 4th is C, not N, and E in 5th.

Another: ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E, not N.

""LINEN"" -> L I N E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""LENIN"" -> L E N I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 4th is N.

Let me search for words: ""BEGIN"" is not because 4th is I.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" is not.

""OZONE"" has E in 5th.

""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""SONIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N, 4th is O.

Not.

""SYNOD"" is S Y N O D, so 3rd is N, 4th is O.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words like ""MANGO"" but 4th is N? M A N G O -> 3rd is N, 4th is G.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINOR"" -> M I N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 3rd is N.

I see the pattern: many words have N in the third position.

We need N in the fourth.

For example, ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> 4th is A? No.

""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> 4th is A.

""LOGAN"" -> 4th is A.

""TONAL"" -> T O N A L -> 3rd is N.

""CONGA"" -> C absent.

""SONGY"" -> not a word.

""DOING"" -> D O I N G -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this has N in the 4th.

And the 5th is G.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""DOING"" doesn't have E.

""FEIGN"" doesn't have E.

""REIGN"" doesn't have E.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" has E but in 3rd and 5th, not 4th.

""LENIN"" has E in 2nd and 5th.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

I think I found one: ""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEINT"" -> F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in the 2nd position.

And the 5th is T.

And it does not have E in the 5th.

Also, it does not contain C, R, A.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid word.

It means to affect or show a feeling.

It's a bit obscure, but it's in the dictionary.

Another word: ""JEANT"" -> not common.

""PEINT"" -> not a word.

""REINT"" -> not common.

""WEINT"" -> not a word.

""HEINT"" -> not common.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEIGN"" -> not common.

""VEINT"" -> not a word.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it does not have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to test its position.

We know E is in the word, so we must include E in the guess to get more information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know where E is.

So we should include E.

Therefore, ""STING"" doesn't have E, so it's not good.

""SPINE"" has E in 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in 5th.

""PHONE"" has E in 5th.

""STONE"" has E in 5th.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not N.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not standard.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""FEINT"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""MOUNT"" -> M O U N T -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

And it has no E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E.

""MOUNT"" doesn't have E.

Similarly, ""COUNT"" -> C absent.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOIST"" -> M O I S T -> no E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me try ""BEING"" but it has I in the 4th.

I think ""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 1.

""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, and not C, R, A.

For example:
- ""EJECT"" invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.
- ""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.
- ""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I found ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

""ELINT"" -> E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in position 1.

And it has no E in the 5th.

And it doesn't have C, R, A.

""ELINT"" is a word? It might be, but let's see: ELINT is a type of intelligence gathering, so it's valid.

But is it common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""EXIST"" -> E X I S T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""EDUCN"" not a word.

""EDUC"" is 4 letters.

""EDUCAT"" is 6 letters.

""EDUCE"" -> E D U C E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""EDUCE"" has C and E in 5th.

Not.

""EGEST"" -> E G E S T -> 1:E, 2:G, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W -> 4th is O.

Not.

""ELUDE"" -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENJOY"" -> E N J O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:J, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""ENACT"" -> E N A C T -> A and C absent.

""ENACT"" is not.

""ENACT"" has A and C.

""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E.

Not.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""EPHAS"" not a word.

""EPHAS"" no.

""ERUPT"" -> E R U P T -> R absent.

""ESKU"" not a word.

I think ""ELINT"" is a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it has no E, but we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know if E is in position 2 or not.

We should include E.

So let's go back to ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

This has E in position 2, and N in position 4.

It has F, I, T.

And no C, R, A.

So it's valid.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 3.

""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.

""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.

""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

Not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""STONE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: F E I N T

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: T

And E is in position 2, which is a new position.

We can use this to test if E is in position 2.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

If we get a dash, then E is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in 1 or 3).

If we get an x, but we know E is in the word, so it can't be x.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid guess.

We can also consider ""DEIGN"" but it has E in position 2 and 4th is G, not N.

Another word: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

Not.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

I think ""FEINT"" is a good choice, even if it's obscure.

We can use ""FEINT"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 2.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

""FEINT"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another one: ""MEANY"" -> M E A N Y -> A absent.

""MEANY"" has A.

""PEONY"" -> P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N! Yes.

And E is in position 2.

And it has P, O, Y.

And no C, R, A.

""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower).

So we have two options: ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"".

""FEINT"" has E in position 2, and ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Both have E in position 2.

We can choose one.

""FEINT"" is less common, but ""PEONY"" is also less common.

But ""PEONY"" is a flower, so it might be accepted.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

So between ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"", I'll choose ""PEONY"" because it's a common enough word.

But let's see the feedback we got: E is in the word but not in the 5th, so if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we get a dash.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we don't have E, then we know E is in position 1 or 3.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Similarly, ""FEINT"" has E in position 2.

I think ""PEONY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the pattern: P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N.

Yes.

And E is in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so if it's not in position 2, we get a dash for E.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we get dashes, we know E is in 1 or 3.

So it's good.

Similarly, for ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

E in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so same as above.

But ""FEINT"" is less common, so ""PEONY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEMON"" is not.

I think ""PEONY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 1.

For example, ""E"" in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, not C, R, A.

[2] and [3] can be various letters.

For example, ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5? ""E S I N T"" -> ""ESINT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""E D U N T"" -> ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""E L I N G"" -> ""ELING"" not a word.

""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> E in 1, L in 2, I in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""ELINT"" is a word.

It's a valid English word.

So we have options: ""FEINT"", ""PEONY"", ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" has E in position 1.

We can choose ""ELINT"".

But ""ELINT"" has L, I, T.

""PEONY"" has P, O, Y.

""FEINT"" has F, I, T.

I think ""ELINT"" is a good choice because it has E in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1, 2, or 3.

By putting E in position 1, we test if it's in position 1.

If we get a check, great. If not, we get a dash, so E is in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So ""ELINT"" is a good guess.

Similarly, ""PEONY"" tests P, O, Y.

I think ""ELINT"" is better because it has more common letters.

""ELINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the pattern: E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

Yes.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

We'll get feedback on E, L, I, N, T.

N is already correct, so we expect a check for N.

E will be a dash or check.

L, I, T will be tested.

So it's good.

Another common word: ""STING"" doesn't have E.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOINT"" not a word.

""MOUNT"" -> no E.

I think ""ELINT"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 3.

For example, ""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""SYNCH"" -> S Y N C H -> C absent.

""SYNOD"" not.

""SYNCH"" not.

""DYING"" -> D Y I N G -> 1:D, 2:Y, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""DYING"" doesn't have E.

""FLING"" -> F L I N G -> no E.

""SLING"" -> S L I N G -> no E.

""SWING"" -> S W I N G -> no E.

""THING"" -> T H I N G -> no E.

""BLIND"" -> B L I N D -> no E.

""GRIND"" -> G R I N D -> R absent.

""FINCH"" -> F I N C H -> C absent.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> C absent and E in 5th.

Not.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""VINYL"" -> V I N Y L -> 3rd is N.

Not.

I think it's hard to find a word with E and N in the 4th.

So ""ELINT"" or ""PEONY"" or ""FEINT"".

I'll go with ""ELINT"" because it's more common.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

But let's write it.

<guess>elint</guess>

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

""PEONY"" is also common enough.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2, same as ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" is E in position 1.

I think either is fine.

Perhaps ""STING"" but it doesn't have E, so we skip.

No, we must include E.

So I choose ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word like ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ESINT"" is not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""ELING"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""D"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> valid.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in position 1.

If E is in position 1, we get a check.

If not, we get a dash and know it's in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So it's good.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

I think ""ELINT"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the word: ELINT is a valid 5-letter word.

Yes.

So second guess: ELINT

In the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in 1.

So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are absent (x).
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is present but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position (e.g., _ _ _ N _).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.

For the second guess, I chose ""elint"" because:
- It includes E (testing position 1) and N (position 4), which are known to be in the word.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It tests new common letters (F, I, T) to gather more information.
- The pattern fits: E in position 1 (testing if E is in position 1), L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (confirmed), T in position 5.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test three new letters.

<guess>elint</guess>",elint,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- An N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- The letter E is present, but not in the 5th position. So it must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or A.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position, so we can try it in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to test.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ _ N _
- With E in one of the first three positions.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ N _
- Position 2: _ E _ N _
- Position 3: _ _ E N _

We should also try to include other common consonants to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent: C, R, A.

Let me try to come up with a word that has N in the 4th position and E in a different position, and includes other common letters.

Option 1: Put E in the first position: E _ _ N _
We need to fill the second and third positions with letters that are not C, R, A, and are common.

Possible words: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has C and J is not common? Also, we know C is absent, so no.
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but we need N in the 4th? No, the 4th is O? Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words ending with N? But wait, the 4th is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _.

So for E in position 1: E _ _ N _

Possible words:
- ""EATEN"" -> but E is in position 1 and 5? We know A is absent, so no.
- ""EXCEL"" -> has C and X, and also C is absent? No.
- ""EDEN"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word? 
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

Perhaps E in position 2: _ E _ N _

Words:
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N, but the 4th letter is I? No, we need the 4th to be N. So the pattern is _ E _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and 5th is something.

In ""BEGIN"", the letters are: B (1), E (2), G (3), I (4), N (5). So the 4th is I and 5th is N? That doesn't match because we need the 4th to be N.

We need the 4th to be N, so the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for _ E _ N _:
- The first letter: ?
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: ?
- Fourth letter: N
- Fifth letter: ?

So the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

We know E is in the word, but not in the 5th position. We are putting it in the 2nd.

Possible words:
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N, but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N? Actually, the 4th is O and 5th is N? That's not the same as having N in the 4th.

Wait, let me clarify the positions:
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 2: second letter
- Position 3: third letter
- Position 4: fourth letter (which is N)
- Position 5: fifth letter

So for a word with E in the second position and N in the fourth: the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

For example, ""SENT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Possible words:
- ""SENT"" is 4, so not.
- ""SENTN"" is not a word.

Actually, common words:
- ""LEMON"" -> L E M O N -> but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N. So the 4th is not N.

I need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.

For example:
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So let's try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).

Pattern: ? E ? N ?

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.

- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.

- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.

But we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.

Also, we are using B, I, G. We don't know about these letters.

But note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.

Also, we are testing B, I, G.

But we must avoid A, C, R.

""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.

N is in the 4th position, which is correct.

E is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.

We also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.

Another possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.

""SENT"" is too short.

""LEMON"" -> same issue.

""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

So the word must be: ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?

Words:
- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

""EDEN"" is 4 letters.

""EXCON"" -> not a word.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:

Position 1: first letter
Position 2: second letter
Position 3: third letter
Position 4: fourth letter = N
Position 5: fifth letter

So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]

We need a word: E ? ? N ?

Examples:
- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.
- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

Words:
- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.
- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.

We need the 4th to be N.

So [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.

So the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.

So for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.

- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.

- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

I see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

And E must be in one of the first three positions.

So for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

What words fit this?
- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.
- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.

In ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Common words: 
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.

- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.

- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.

- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.

But we have E to include? We don't have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.

We should include E to test its position.

So we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).

Let me list words with N in the 4th position.

For example:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Another example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.

""IRON"" is 4 letters.

""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So let's think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

For example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.

""LLANO"" -> not a common word.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.

I think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.

Another idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

I see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.

Without A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.

But ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.

So for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.

""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] are not E? We don't know, but we can have other letters.

For example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.

""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Let me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So the word is: ... N ?

Like in ""URBAN"", but U R B A N -> R and A absent.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> A absent.

""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No.

""CONIC"" -> C is absent.

""LOGIC"" -> C absent.

""TOPIC"" -> C absent.

""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E, not N.

""AXION"" -> A absent.

""OPIUM"" -> no E.

I'm struggling.

Perhaps E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]

[1] and [3] and [5] must be filled, and [5] cannot be E.

Examples:
- ""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.
- ""BEING"" -> 4th is I.
- ""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.
- ""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""SENT"" is 4 letters.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R is absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> T E P E E -> 4th is E, 5th is E.

But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need the 5th to be something else.

What about ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""BEVY"" is 4 letters.

I think I need to consider that the word might have E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] and [5] are not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""BLUNT"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me think: ""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCENE"" -> S C E N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] are not E, and [5] is not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> no E.
- ""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.
- ""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.
- ""SPINE"" -> has E in 5th.
- ""SHINE"" -> has E in 5th.

What about ""DEMON""? No, 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

I found one: ""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E -> 4th is C, not N, and E in 5th.

Another: ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E, not N.

""LINEN"" -> L I N E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""LENIN"" -> L E N I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 4th is N.

Let me search for words: ""BEGIN"" is not because 4th is I.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" is not.

""OZONE"" has E in 5th.

""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""SONIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N, 4th is O.

Not.

""SYNOD"" is S Y N O D, so 3rd is N, 4th is O.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words like ""MANGO"" but 4th is N? M A N G O -> 3rd is N, 4th is G.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINOR"" -> M I N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 3rd is N.

I see the pattern: many words have N in the third position.

We need N in the fourth.

For example, ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> 4th is A? No.

""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> 4th is A.

""LOGAN"" -> 4th is A.

""TONAL"" -> T O N A L -> 3rd is N.

""CONGA"" -> C absent.

""SONGY"" -> not a word.

""DOING"" -> D O I N G -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this has N in the 4th.

And the 5th is G.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""DOING"" doesn't have E.

""FEIGN"" doesn't have E.

""REIGN"" doesn't have E.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" has E but in 3rd and 5th, not 4th.

""LENIN"" has E in 2nd and 5th.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

I think I found one: ""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEINT"" -> F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in the 2nd position.

And the 5th is T.

And it does not have E in the 5th.

Also, it does not contain C, R, A.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid word.

It means to affect or show a feeling.

It's a bit obscure, but it's in the dictionary.

Another word: ""JEANT"" -> not common.

""PEINT"" -> not a word.

""REINT"" -> not common.

""WEINT"" -> not a word.

""HEINT"" -> not common.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEIGN"" -> not common.

""VEINT"" -> not a word.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it does not have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to test its position.

We know E is in the word, so we must include E in the guess to get more information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know where E is.

So we should include E.

Therefore, ""STING"" doesn't have E, so it's not good.

""SPINE"" has E in 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in 5th.

""PHONE"" has E in 5th.

""STONE"" has E in 5th.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not N.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not standard.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""FEINT"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""MOUNT"" -> M O U N T -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

And it has no E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E.

""MOUNT"" doesn't have E.

Similarly, ""COUNT"" -> C absent.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOIST"" -> M O I S T -> no E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me try ""BEING"" but it has I in the 4th.

I think ""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 1.

""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, and not C, R, A.

For example:
- ""EJECT"" invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.
- ""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.
- ""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I found ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

""ELINT"" -> E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in position 1.

And it has no E in the 5th.

And it doesn't have C, R, A.

""ELINT"" is a word? It might be, but let's see: ELINT is a type of intelligence gathering, so it's valid.

But is it common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""EXIST"" -> E X I S T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""EDUCN"" not a word.

""EDUC"" is 4 letters.

""EDUCAT"" is 6 letters.

""EDUCE"" -> E D U C E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""EDUCE"" has C and E in 5th.

Not.

""EGEST"" -> E G E S T -> 1:E, 2:G, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W -> 4th is O.

Not.

""ELUDE"" -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENJOY"" -> E N J O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:J, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""ENACT"" -> E N A C T -> A and C absent.

""ENACT"" is not.

""ENACT"" has A and C.

""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E.

Not.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""EPHAS"" not a word.

""EPHAS"" no.

""ERUPT"" -> E R U P T -> R absent.

""ESKU"" not a word.

I think ""ELINT"" is a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it has no E, but we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know if E is in position 2 or not.

We should include E.

So let's go back to ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

This has E in position 2, and N in position 4.

It has F, I, T.

And no C, R, A.

So it's valid.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 3.

""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.

""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.

""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

Not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""STONE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: F E I N T

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: T

And E is in position 2, which is a new position.

We can use this to test if E is in position 2.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

If we get a dash, then E is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in 1 or 3).

If we get an x, but we know E is in the word, so it can't be x.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid guess.

We can also consider ""DEIGN"" but it has E in position 2 and 4th is G, not N.

Another word: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

Not.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

I think ""FEINT"" is a good choice, even if it's obscure.

We can use ""FEINT"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 2.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

""FEINT"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another one: ""MEANY"" -> M E A N Y -> A absent.

""MEANY"" has A.

""PEONY"" -> P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N! Yes.

And E is in position 2.

And it has P, O, Y.

And no C, R, A.

""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower).

So we have two options: ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"".

""FEINT"" has E in position 2, and ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Both have E in position 2.

We can choose one.

""FEINT"" is less common, but ""PEONY"" is also less common.

But ""PEONY"" is a flower, so it might be accepted.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

So between ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"", I'll choose ""PEONY"" because it's a common enough word.

But let's see the feedback we got: E is in the word but not in the 5th, so if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we get a dash.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we don't have E, then we know E is in position 1 or 3.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Similarly, ""FEINT"" has E in position 2.

I think ""PEONY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the pattern: P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N.

Yes.

And E is in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so if it's not in position 2, we get a dash for E.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we get dashes, we know E is in 1 or 3.

So it's good.

Similarly, for ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

E in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so same as above.

But ""FEINT"" is less common, so ""PEONY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEMON"" is not.

I think ""PEONY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 1.

For example, ""E"" in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, not C, R, A.

[2] and [3] can be various letters.

For example, ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5? ""E S I N T"" -> ""ESINT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""E D U N T"" -> ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""E L I N G"" -> ""ELING"" not a word.

""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> E in 1, L in 2, I in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""ELINT"" is a word.

It's a valid English word.

So we have options: ""FEINT"", ""PEONY"", ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" has E in position 1.

We can choose ""ELINT"".

But ""ELINT"" has L, I, T.

""PEONY"" has P, O, Y.

""FEINT"" has F, I, T.

I think ""ELINT"" is a good choice because it has E in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1, 2, or 3.

By putting E in position 1, we test if it's in position 1.

If we get a check, great. If not, we get a dash, so E is in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So ""ELINT"" is a good guess.

Similarly, ""PEONY"" tests P, O, Y.

I think ""ELINT"" is better because it has more common letters.

""ELINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the pattern: E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

Yes.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

We'll get feedback on E, L, I, N, T.

N is already correct, so we expect a check for N.

E will be a dash or check.

L, I, T will be tested.

So it's good.

Another common word: ""STING"" doesn't have E.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOINT"" not a word.

""MOUNT"" -> no E.

I think ""ELINT"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 3.

For example, ""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""SYNCH"" -> S Y N C H -> C absent.

""SYNOD"" not.

""SYNCH"" not.

""DYING"" -> D Y I N G -> 1:D, 2:Y, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""DYING"" doesn't have E.

""FLING"" -> F L I N G -> no E.

""SLING"" -> S L I N G -> no E.

""SWING"" -> S W I N G -> no E.

""THING"" -> T H I N G -> no E.

""BLIND"" -> B L I N D -> no E.

""GRIND"" -> G R I N D -> R absent.

""FINCH"" -> F I N C H -> C absent.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> C absent and E in 5th.

Not.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""VINYL"" -> V I N Y L -> 3rd is N.

Not.

I think it's hard to find a word with E and N in the 4th.

So ""ELINT"" or ""PEONY"" or ""FEINT"".

I'll go with ""ELINT"" because it's more common.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

But let's write it.

<guess>elint</guess>

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

""PEONY"" is also common enough.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2, same as ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" is E in position 1.

I think either is fine.

Perhaps ""STING"" but it doesn't have E, so we skip.

No, we must include E.

So I choose ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word like ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ESINT"" is not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""ELING"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""D"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> valid.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in position 1.

If E is in position 1, we get a check.

If not, we get a dash and know it's in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So it's good.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

I think ""ELINT"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the word: ELINT is a valid 5-letter word.

Yes.

So second guess: ELINT

In the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in 1.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are absent (x).
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is present but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position (e.g., _ _ _ N _).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.

For the second guess, I chose ""elint"" because:
- It includes E (testing position 1) and N (position 4), which are known to be in the word.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It tests new common letters (F, I, T) to gather more information.
- The pattern fits: E in position 1 (testing if E is in position 1), L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (confirmed), T in position 5.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test three new letters.",Guess 2: elint -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) I(-) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- An N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- The letter E is present, but not in the 5th position. So it must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or A.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position, so we can try it in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to test.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ _ N _
- With E in one of the first three positions.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ N _
- Position 2: _ E _ N _
- Position 3: _ _ E N _

We should also try to include other common consonants to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent: C, R, A.

Let me try to come up with a word that has N in the 4th position and E in a different position, and includes other common letters.

Option 1: Put E in the first position: E _ _ N _
We need to fill the second and third positions with letters that are not C, R, A, and are common.

Possible words: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has C and J is not common? Also, we know C is absent, so no.
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but we need N in the 4th? No, the 4th is O? Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words ending with N? But wait, the 4th is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _.

So for E in position 1: E _ _ N _

Possible words:
- ""EATEN"" -> but E is in position 1 and 5? We know A is absent, so no.
- ""EXCEL"" -> has C and X, and also C is absent? No.
- ""EDEN"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word? 
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

Perhaps E in position 2: _ E _ N _

Words:
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N, but the 4th letter is I? No, we need the 4th to be N. So the pattern is _ E _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and 5th is something.

In ""BEGIN"", the letters are: B (1), E (2), G (3), I (4), N (5). So the 4th is I and 5th is N? That doesn't match because we need the 4th to be N.

We need the 4th to be N, so the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for _ E _ N _:
- The first letter: ?
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: ?
- Fourth letter: N
- Fifth letter: ?

So the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

We know E is in the word, but not in the 5th position. We are putting it in the 2nd.

Possible words:
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N, but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N? Actually, the 4th is O and 5th is N? That's not the same as having N in the 4th.

Wait, let me clarify the positions:
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 2: second letter
- Position 3: third letter
- Position 4: fourth letter (which is N)
- Position 5: fifth letter

So for a word with E in the second position and N in the fourth: the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

For example, ""SENT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Possible words:
- ""SENT"" is 4, so not.
- ""SENTN"" is not a word.

Actually, common words:
- ""LEMON"" -> L E M O N -> but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N. So the 4th is not N.

I need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.

For example:
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So let's try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).

Pattern: ? E ? N ?

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.

- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.

- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.

But we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.

Also, we are using B, I, G. We don't know about these letters.

But note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.

Also, we are testing B, I, G.

But we must avoid A, C, R.

""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.

N is in the 4th position, which is correct.

E is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.

We also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.

Another possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.

""SENT"" is too short.

""LEMON"" -> same issue.

""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

So the word must be: ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?

Words:
- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

""EDEN"" is 4 letters.

""EXCON"" -> not a word.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:

Position 1: first letter
Position 2: second letter
Position 3: third letter
Position 4: fourth letter = N
Position 5: fifth letter

So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]

We need a word: E ? ? N ?

Examples:
- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.
- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

Words:
- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.
- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.

We need the 4th to be N.

So [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.

So the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.

So for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.

- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.

- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

I see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

And E must be in one of the first three positions.

So for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

What words fit this?
- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.
- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.

In ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Common words: 
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.

- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.

- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.

- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.

But we have E to include? We don't have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.

We should include E to test its position.

So we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).

Let me list words with N in the 4th position.

For example:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Another example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.

""IRON"" is 4 letters.

""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So let's think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

For example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.

""LLANO"" -> not a common word.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.

I think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.

Another idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

I see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.

Without A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.

But ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.

So for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.

""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] are not E? We don't know, but we can have other letters.

For example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.

""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Let me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So the word is: ... N ?

Like in ""URBAN"", but U R B A N -> R and A absent.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> A absent.

""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No.

""CONIC"" -> C is absent.

""LOGIC"" -> C absent.

""TOPIC"" -> C absent.

""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E, not N.

""AXION"" -> A absent.

""OPIUM"" -> no E.

I'm struggling.

Perhaps E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]

[1] and [3] and [5] must be filled, and [5] cannot be E.

Examples:
- ""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.
- ""BEING"" -> 4th is I.
- ""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.
- ""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""SENT"" is 4 letters.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R is absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> T E P E E -> 4th is E, 5th is E.

But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need the 5th to be something else.

What about ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""BEVY"" is 4 letters.

I think I need to consider that the word might have E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] and [5] are not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""BLUNT"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me think: ""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCENE"" -> S C E N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] are not E, and [5] is not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> no E.
- ""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.
- ""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.
- ""SPINE"" -> has E in 5th.
- ""SHINE"" -> has E in 5th.

What about ""DEMON""? No, 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

I found one: ""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E -> 4th is C, not N, and E in 5th.

Another: ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E, not N.

""LINEN"" -> L I N E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""LENIN"" -> L E N I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 4th is N.

Let me search for words: ""BEGIN"" is not because 4th is I.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" is not.

""OZONE"" has E in 5th.

""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""SONIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N, 4th is O.

Not.

""SYNOD"" is S Y N O D, so 3rd is N, 4th is O.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words like ""MANGO"" but 4th is N? M A N G O -> 3rd is N, 4th is G.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINOR"" -> M I N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 3rd is N.

I see the pattern: many words have N in the third position.

We need N in the fourth.

For example, ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> 4th is A? No.

""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> 4th is A.

""LOGAN"" -> 4th is A.

""TONAL"" -> T O N A L -> 3rd is N.

""CONGA"" -> C absent.

""SONGY"" -> not a word.

""DOING"" -> D O I N G -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this has N in the 4th.

And the 5th is G.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""DOING"" doesn't have E.

""FEIGN"" doesn't have E.

""REIGN"" doesn't have E.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" has E but in 3rd and 5th, not 4th.

""LENIN"" has E in 2nd and 5th.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

I think I found one: ""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEINT"" -> F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in the 2nd position.

And the 5th is T.

And it does not have E in the 5th.

Also, it does not contain C, R, A.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid word.

It means to affect or show a feeling.

It's a bit obscure, but it's in the dictionary.

Another word: ""JEANT"" -> not common.

""PEINT"" -> not a word.

""REINT"" -> not common.

""WEINT"" -> not a word.

""HEINT"" -> not common.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEIGN"" -> not common.

""VEINT"" -> not a word.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it does not have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to test its position.

We know E is in the word, so we must include E in the guess to get more information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know where E is.

So we should include E.

Therefore, ""STING"" doesn't have E, so it's not good.

""SPINE"" has E in 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in 5th.

""PHONE"" has E in 5th.

""STONE"" has E in 5th.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not N.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not standard.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""FEINT"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""MOUNT"" -> M O U N T -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

And it has no E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E.

""MOUNT"" doesn't have E.

Similarly, ""COUNT"" -> C absent.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOIST"" -> M O I S T -> no E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me try ""BEING"" but it has I in the 4th.

I think ""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 1.

""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, and not C, R, A.

For example:
- ""EJECT"" invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.
- ""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.
- ""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I found ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

""ELINT"" -> E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in position 1.

And it has no E in the 5th.

And it doesn't have C, R, A.

""ELINT"" is a word? It might be, but let's see: ELINT is a type of intelligence gathering, so it's valid.

But is it common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""EXIST"" -> E X I S T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""EDUCN"" not a word.

""EDUC"" is 4 letters.

""EDUCAT"" is 6 letters.

""EDUCE"" -> E D U C E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""EDUCE"" has C and E in 5th.

Not.

""EGEST"" -> E G E S T -> 1:E, 2:G, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W -> 4th is O.

Not.

""ELUDE"" -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENJOY"" -> E N J O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:J, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""ENACT"" -> E N A C T -> A and C absent.

""ENACT"" is not.

""ENACT"" has A and C.

""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E.

Not.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""EPHAS"" not a word.

""EPHAS"" no.

""ERUPT"" -> E R U P T -> R absent.

""ESKU"" not a word.

I think ""ELINT"" is a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it has no E, but we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know if E is in position 2 or not.

We should include E.

So let's go back to ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

This has E in position 2, and N in position 4.

It has F, I, T.

And no C, R, A.

So it's valid.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 3.

""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.

""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.

""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

Not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""STONE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: F E I N T

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: T

And E is in position 2, which is a new position.

We can use this to test if E is in position 2.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

If we get a dash, then E is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in 1 or 3).

If we get an x, but we know E is in the word, so it can't be x.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid guess.

We can also consider ""DEIGN"" but it has E in position 2 and 4th is G, not N.

Another word: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

Not.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

I think ""FEINT"" is a good choice, even if it's obscure.

We can use ""FEINT"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 2.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

""FEINT"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another one: ""MEANY"" -> M E A N Y -> A absent.

""MEANY"" has A.

""PEONY"" -> P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N! Yes.

And E is in position 2.

And it has P, O, Y.

And no C, R, A.

""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower).

So we have two options: ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"".

""FEINT"" has E in position 2, and ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Both have E in position 2.

We can choose one.

""FEINT"" is less common, but ""PEONY"" is also less common.

But ""PEONY"" is a flower, so it might be accepted.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

So between ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"", I'll choose ""PEONY"" because it's a common enough word.

But let's see the feedback we got: E is in the word but not in the 5th, so if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we get a dash.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we don't have E, then we know E is in position 1 or 3.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Similarly, ""FEINT"" has E in position 2.

I think ""PEONY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the pattern: P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N.

Yes.

And E is in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so if it's not in position 2, we get a dash for E.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we get dashes, we know E is in 1 or 3.

So it's good.

Similarly, for ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

E in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so same as above.

But ""FEINT"" is less common, so ""PEONY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEMON"" is not.

I think ""PEONY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 1.

For example, ""E"" in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, not C, R, A.

[2] and [3] can be various letters.

For example, ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5? ""E S I N T"" -> ""ESINT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""E D U N T"" -> ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""E L I N G"" -> ""ELING"" not a word.

""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> E in 1, L in 2, I in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""ELINT"" is a word.

It's a valid English word.

So we have options: ""FEINT"", ""PEONY"", ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" has E in position 1.

We can choose ""ELINT"".

But ""ELINT"" has L, I, T.

""PEONY"" has P, O, Y.

""FEINT"" has F, I, T.

I think ""ELINT"" is a good choice because it has E in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1, 2, or 3.

By putting E in position 1, we test if it's in position 1.

If we get a check, great. If not, we get a dash, so E is in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So ""ELINT"" is a good guess.

Similarly, ""PEONY"" tests P, O, Y.

I think ""ELINT"" is better because it has more common letters.

""ELINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the pattern: E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

Yes.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

We'll get feedback on E, L, I, N, T.

N is already correct, so we expect a check for N.

E will be a dash or check.

L, I, T will be tested.

So it's good.

Another common word: ""STING"" doesn't have E.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOINT"" not a word.

""MOUNT"" -> no E.

I think ""ELINT"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 3.

For example, ""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""SYNCH"" -> S Y N C H -> C absent.

""SYNOD"" not.

""SYNCH"" not.

""DYING"" -> D Y I N G -> 1:D, 2:Y, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""DYING"" doesn't have E.

""FLING"" -> F L I N G -> no E.

""SLING"" -> S L I N G -> no E.

""SWING"" -> S W I N G -> no E.

""THING"" -> T H I N G -> no E.

""BLIND"" -> B L I N D -> no E.

""GRIND"" -> G R I N D -> R absent.

""FINCH"" -> F I N C H -> C absent.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> C absent and E in 5th.

Not.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""VINYL"" -> V I N Y L -> 3rd is N.

Not.

I think it's hard to find a word with E and N in the 4th.

So ""ELINT"" or ""PEONY"" or ""FEINT"".

I'll go with ""ELINT"" because it's more common.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

But let's write it.

<guess>elint</guess>

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

""PEONY"" is also common enough.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2, same as ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" is E in position 1.

I think either is fine.

Perhaps ""STING"" but it doesn't have E, so we skip.

No, we must include E.

So I choose ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word like ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ESINT"" is not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""ELING"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""D"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> valid.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in position 1.

If E is in position 1, we get a check.

If not, we get a dash and know it's in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So it's good.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

I think ""ELINT"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the word: ELINT is a valid 5-letter word.

Yes.

So second guess: ELINT

In the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in 1.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are absent (x).
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is present but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position (e.g., _ _ _ N _).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.

For the second guess, I chose ""elint"" because:
- It includes E (testing position 1) and N (position 4), which are known to be in the word.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It tests new common letters (F, I, T) to gather more information.
- The pattern fits: E in position 1 (testing if E is in position 1), L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (confirmed), T in position 5.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test three new letters.

So the 4th is not N.\n\nI need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.\n\nFor example:\n- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can\'t use A.\n\nWe know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, A.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).\n\nPattern: ? E ? N ?\n\nWe need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.\n\n- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.\n\n- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.\n\nBut we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.\n\nAlso, we are using B, I, G. We don\'t know about these letters.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.\n\nAlso, we are testing B, I, G.\n\nBut we must avoid A, C, R.\n\n""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.\n\nN is in the 4th position, which is correct.\n\nE is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.\n\nWe also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.\n\n""SENT"" is too short.\n\n""LEMON"" -> same issue.\n\n""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? ? N ?\n\nWith E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?\n\nWords:\n- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.\n- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.\n- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.\n\n""EDEN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""EXCON"" -> not a word.\n\n""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the positions.\n\nLet me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:\n\nPosition 1: first letter\nPosition 2: second letter\nPosition 3: third letter\nPosition 4: fourth letter = N\nPosition 5: fifth letter\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]\n\nWe want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nCase 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]\n\nWe need a word: E ? ? N ?\n\nExamples:\n- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.\n- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.\n- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.\n\nLet me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nWords:\n- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.\n- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nExamples:\n- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.\n\nI think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.\n\nSo for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nExamples:\n- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.\n\n- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.\n\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.\n\nI see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]\n\nAnd E must be in one of the first three positions.\n\nSo for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nWhat words fit this?\n- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.\n- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.\n\nIn ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.\n\nI think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.\n\n- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.\n\n- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.\n\n- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.\n\nBut we have E to include? We don\'t have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it\'s in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nBut we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.\n\nWe should include E to test its position.\n\nSo we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).\n\nLet me list words with N in the 4th position.\n\nFor example:\n- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.\n\nBut does it have E? No.\n\nWe need a word that has E and N in the 4th.\n\nAnother example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.\n\n""IRON"" is 4 letters.\n\n""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\n""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.\n\nFor example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.\n\n""LLANO"" -> not a common word.\n\n""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.\n\nI think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.\n\nAnother idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.\n\n""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""BEING"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.\n\nI see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.\n\nWithout A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.\n\nBut ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.\n\nSo for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.\n\n""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.\n\n""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.\n\nAnd the 4th is N.\n\nLet me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]\n\n[2] and [3] are not E? We don\'t know, but we can have other letters.\n\nFor example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.\n\n""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.\n\n""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.\n\nI think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.\n\nLet me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.\n\nSo the word is: ... N ?\n\nLike in ""URBAN"", but U R B A N -> R and A absent.\n\n""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> A absent.\n\n""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No.\n\n""CONIC"" -> C is absent.\n\n""LOGIC"" -> C absent.\n\n""TOPIC"" -> C absent.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E, not N.\n\n""AXION"" -> A absent.\n\n""OPIUM"" -> no E.\n\nI\'m struggling.\n\nPerhaps E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]\n\n[1] and [3] and [5] must be filled, and [5] cannot be E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.\n- ""BEING"" -> 4th is I.\n- ""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.\n- ""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.\n\n""SENT"" is 4 letters.\n\n""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.\n\n""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.\n\n""REIGN"" -> R is absent.\n\n""SEIGN"" -> not common.\n\n""TEPEE"" -> T E P E E -> 4th is E, 5th is E.\n\nBut E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we need the 5th to be something else.\n\nWhat about ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> 4th is E.\n\nNot matching.\n\n""BEVY"" is 4 letters.\n\nI think I need to consider that the word might have E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\n[1] and [2] and [5] are not E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.\n\nBut does it have E? No.\n\nWe need a word that has E.\n\n""BLUNT"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe need a word that has E and N in the 4th.\n\nLet me think: ""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\n""SHINE"" -> same.\n\n""PHONE"" -> same.\n\n""SCENE"" -> S C E N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.\n\n""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.\n\nSo we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.\n\nAnd the 4th is N.\n\nLet me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\n[1] and [2] are not E, and [5] is not E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BLUNT"" -> no E.\n- ""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.\n- ""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.\n- ""SPINE"" -> has E in 5th.\n- ""SHINE"" -> has E in 5th.\n\nWhat about ""DEMON""? No, 4th is O.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""BEING"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.\n\n""REIGN"" -> R absent.\n\n""SEIGN"" -> not common.\n\n""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.\n\nI found one: ""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E -> 4th is C, not N, and E in 5th.\n\nAnother: ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E, not N.\n\n""LINEN"" -> L I N E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E.\n\nNot matching.\n\n""LENIN"" -> L E N I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.\n\nI think I need to consider that the word might be ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 4th is N.\n\nLet me search for words: ""BEGIN"" is not because 4th is I.\n\n""BEING"" is not.\n\n""FEIGN"" is not.\n\n""DEIGN"" is not.\n\n""REIGN"" is not.\n\n""SEIGN"" is not standard.\n\n""TEPEE"" is not.\n\n""OZONE"" has E in 5th.\n\n""AXION"" has A and X.\n\n""IONIC"" has C.\n\n""SONIC"" has C.\n\n""TONIC"" has C.\n\n""CONIC"" has C.\n\n""LOGIC"" has C.\n\n""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N, 4th is O.\n\nNot.\n\n""SYNOD"" is S Y N O D, so 3rd is N, 4th is O.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nLet me think of words like ""MANGO"" but 4th is N?

No.\n\n""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> 4th is A.\n\n""LOGAN"" -> 4th is A.\n\n""TONAL"" -> T O N A L -> 3rd is N.\n\n""CONGA"" -> C absent.\n\n""SONGY"" -> not a word.\n\n""DOING"" -> D O I N G -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this has N in the 4th.\n\nAnd the 5th is G.\n\nBut does it have E? No.\n\nWe need a word that has E.\n\n""DOING"" doesn\'t have E.\n\n""FEIGN"" doesn\'t have E.\n\n""REIGN"" doesn\'t have E.\n\n""SEIGN"" is not standard.\n\n""TEPEE"" has E but in 3rd and 5th, not 4th.\n\n""LENIN"" has E in 2nd and 5th.\n\n""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.\n\nI think I found one: ""BEGIN"" is not.\n\n""BEING"" is not.\n\n""FEINT"" -> F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.\n\nAnd E is in the 2nd position.\n\nAnd the 5th is T.\n\nAnd it does not have E in the 5th.\n\nAlso, it does not contain C, R, A.\n\nSo ""FEINT"" is a valid word.\n\nIt means to affect or show a feeling.\n\nIt\'s a bit obscure, but it\'s in the dictionary.\n\nAnother word: ""JEANT"" -> not common.\n\n""PEINT"" -> not a word.\n\n""REINT"" -> not common.\n\n""WEINT"" -> not a word.\n\n""HEINT"" -> not common.\n\n""DEIGN"" is not.\n\n""REIGN"" is not.\n\n""SEIGN"" is not standard.\n\n""TEIGN"" -> not common.\n\n""VEINT"" -> not a word.\n\n""BEING"" is not.\n\n""FEIGN"" is not.\n\n""FEINT"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.\n\nAnd it does not have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to test its position.\n\nWe know E is in the word, so we must include E in the guess to get more information about its position.\n\nIf we don\'t include E, we won\'t know where E is.\n\nSo we should include E.\n\nTherefore, ""STING"" doesn\'t have E, so it\'s not good.\n\n""SPINE"" has E in 5th.\n\n""SHINE"" has E in 5th.\n\n""PHONE"" has E in 5th.\n\n""STONE"" has E in 5th.\n\n""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.\n\n""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.\n\nNot N.\n\n""SONIC"" has C.\n\nI think ""FEINT"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother word: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.\n\nNot.\n\n""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.\n\n""REIGN"" -> R absent.\n\n""SEIGN"" -> not standard.\n\n""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.\n\n""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""BEING"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.\n\n""FEINT"" is the only one I can think of.\n\nAnother one: ""MOUNT"" -> M O U N T -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.\n\nAnd it has no E?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so the 4th letter is N)
- E: - (present but not in the 5th position)

Guess 2: ""elint""
- E: - (present but not in the 1st position)
- L: - (present but not in the 2nd position)
- I: - (present but not in the 3rd position)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so 4th letter is N)
- T: x (absent)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The 4th letter is N.
2. The letter E is in the word, but not in the 1st or 5th position (from guess 1 and 2). Since the 5th position was tested in guess 1 and found not to be E, and in guess 2, E was in position 1 and found not to be there, so E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The letter L is in the word, but not in the 2nd position (tested in ""elint"", where L was in position 2).
4. The letter I is in the word, but not in the 3rd position (tested in ""elint"", where I was in position 3).
5. The letter T is absent.
6. The letters C, R, A, T are absent (from guess 2: T is x).

Also, from guess 1, we know C, R, A are absent.

So, absent letters: C, R, A, T.

Present letters: E, L, I, N (N is fixed in position 4).

We know E is in the word and must be in position 2 or 3.

L is in the word but not in position 2.

I is in the word but not in position 3.

N is fixed at position 4.

We need to find a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes E (in position 2 or 3) and L and I (but not in the positions tested: E not in 1 or 5, L not in 2, I not in 3).
- Avoids C, R, A, T.

Also, the word must be 5 letters.

Let's list possible positions:

Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 2, E not in 1), and cannot be C, R, A, T.
Position 2: unknown, but cannot be L (from guess 2, L not in 2), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, E must be in position 2 or 3, so if position 2 is not E, then E must be in 3.
Position 3: unknown, but cannot be I (from guess 2, I not in 3), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, E could be here.
Position 4: N (fixed).
Position 5: unknown, but cannot be E (from guess 1, E not in 5), and cannot be C, R, A, T.

Since E must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider two cases.

But we need to choose a word that tests these.

We also need to include L and I, but not in the positions we know they are not.

L is not in position 2.

I is not in position 3.

We can try to put E in position 2 to test that.

If we put E in position 2, then we can test if E is in position 2.

If not, then E must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can test L and I in new positions.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and include E in position 2 or 3, and L and I.

First, with E in position 2: _ E _ N _

We need to fill position 1, 3, and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, R, A, T, and not E (if we assume no duplicates, but we don't know, so avoid E for now? But E is already in position 2, so if we use E again, it might be duplicate, but we don't know if the word has duplicates. However, to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Similarly, position 3: cannot be C, R, A, T, and not E? We can use E in position 3 if needed, but we are testing position 2 for E first.

Position 5: cannot be E, C, R, A, T.

And we must include L and I.

So the word: [1] E [3] N [5]

[1] and [3] and [5] are to be filled with letters not in {C, R, A, T} and not E? Not necessarily, but we can avoid E for now.

Possible letters for [1], [3], [5]: all letters except C, R, A, T, E (but E is allowed only if duplicated, but we don't know).

But we know E is in the word, so if we use E in position 3, that's possible.

Similarly, L and I must be included.

So the word must contain L and I.

Now, L is not in position 2, so in position 1 or 3 or 5.

I is not in position 3, so in position 1, 2, or 5.

But position 2 is E in this pattern, so I cannot be in position 2.

So I can be in position 1 or 5.

L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But position 3: if we put L in position 3, that's possible.

But we are testing E in position 2.

If we put I in position 1 or 5.

Let's try to form words.

For example, with E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]

We need to include L and I.

[1] can be L? Then we have L E [3] N [5]

But [3] and [5] must include I and something else.

For example, L E I N ? -> but [5] must be a letter, and we have I in position 3? But position 3 is not I? We can put I in position 3? But in guess 2, I was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3. Therefore, in this guess, we cannot put I in position 3.

Similarly, L cannot be in position 2.

So if we have L in position 1: L E [3] N [5]

[3] cannot be I (since I not in 3), so [3] must be a letter that is not I, and not C, R, A, T.

[5] must be a letter that is not E, C, R, A, T, and not I? Not necessarily, I can be in [5].

But I is not in position 3, so if I is in [5], that's possible.

Similarly, L is in [1], which is new.

But we need to include I, so if we put I in position 1, then position 5 is something else.

Or if we put I in position 5.

Similarly, L in position 1.

But let's list possible words.

For example, ""LEMON"" -> but O is not tested, but we have L E M O N -> 4th is O, not N.

Not.

""LEVIN"" -> L E V I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:V, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.

Not.

""LEVIN"" -> not common.

""LEGIN"" -> not a word.

""LEVIN"" not standard.

""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

Not.

""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N! Yes.

But in ""BEING"", we have:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

Now, from feedback, we know that I is not in position 3 (from guess 2), but in ""BEING"", I is in position 3, which is the same position as before? But we are allowed to test, but if we put I in position 3, and we know I is not in position 3, we will get a dash or x? But we know I is in the word, so if we put it in position 3, we get a dash because it's not in position 3, but it's in the word.

But we already know I is not in position 3, so it would be redundant.

We should avoid putting I in position 3 because we know it's not there.

Similarly, we know L is not in position 2, so in ""BEING"", L is not included, but we need to test L.

We must include L and I.

In ""BEING"", we have I, but not L.

We need to include L.

So let's try a word with L.

For example, with E in position 2: L E ? N ?

We need to fill position 3 and 5.

Position 3: cannot be I, and not C, R, A, T.

Position 5: cannot be E, C, R, A, T.

And we must include I in position 1 or 5.

If we put I in position 1: I L E ? N -> but position 2 is E, position 3 is ?, position 4 is N, position 5: ?

But we have I in position 1, L in position 2? But L cannot be in position 2! From guess 2, L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2.

In this pattern, if we put I in position 1, then position 2 is E, position 3 is ?, position 4 is N, position 5 is ?

But L must be included, so we can put L in position 3 or 5.

But position 2 is E, so L cannot be in position 2.

So if we have I in position 1, L in position 3: I E L N [5]

Then position 5 is [5], which must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T} and not E, I, L? But I and L are already used.

Position 5: must be a new letter.

Words: ""IELN"" not a word.

""IELD"" not a word.

""IELM"" not a word.

""IELN"" not.

""IELM"" not.

Not many words.

If we put L in position 5: I E [3] N L

Then position 3 is [3], which must not be I (since I not in 3), and not C, R, A, T.

Position 3: cannot be I, and I is not there anyway.

So I E [3] N L

What can [3] be? For example, ""I E S N L"" -> ""ISENL"" not a word.

""I E D N L"" -> ""IEDNL"" not.

""I E V N L"" -> ""IEVNL"" not.

Not common words.

With E in position 3: _ _ E N _

We need to include L and I.

Position 1 and 2: letters not C, R, A, T, and not E, I, L? But I and L can be in position 1 and 2.

But I cannot be in position 3, but here position 3 is E, so I can be in position 1 or 2.

L can be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But position 2: if we put I in position 2, that's possible.

But we know L is not in position 2, so if we put L in position 1 or 5.

Let's try L in position 1: L [2] E N [5]

But position 2: cannot be L (known), and not C, R, A, T.

[2] can be I? But I is not in position 3, but position 2 is allowed for I.

I can be in position 2.

So L [2] E N [5]

We need to put I in position 1 or 2 or 5.

If we put I in position 1: I L [2] E N [5] -> but position 2 is [2], which can be a letter, and then E in position 3? No, we are putting E in position 3? In this pattern, if we have L in position 1, then position 2 is ?, position 3 is E, position 4 is N, position 5: ?

So I L ? E N ?

But we have I in position 1, L in position 2? But L cannot be in position 2! From guess 2, L is not in position 2, so we cannot put L in position 2.

In this setup, if we put L in position 1, then position 2 is a new letter, not L.

So I L [2] E N [5]

Then [2] must be a letter, and [5] must be a letter not E, C, R, A, T.

And we must include I in position 1 or [5].

If we put I in position 1: I L [2] E N [5]

Then [2] is not L, not C, R, A, T.

[5] is not E, C, R, A, T, and not I, L? Not necessarily, but we can avoid for now.

Words: ""ILEN"" not a word.

""IOLN"" not.

""ILEN"" not.

Not common.

If we put I in position 5: I L [2] E N I -> but position 5 is I, which is not allowed because we know I is not in position 5? From feedback, we don't know about position 5 for I, but we know I is not in position 3, but position 5 is possible? We don't have information about position 5 for I.

In guess 2, I was in position 3, marked dash, so not in 3, but it could be in 1,2,4,5. Position 4 is N, so not. Position 1,2,5 are possible.

But we don't know.

If we put I in position 5: I L [2] E N I -> but that has two I's? ""IL EN I"" not a word.

""I L E N [5]"" with I in position 5: words like ""ILENT"" not a word.

""I L E N D"" -> ""ILEND"" not.

""I L E N T"" -> ""ILENT"" not a word.

""I L E N S"" -> ""ILES"" is 4 letters.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The 4th letter is N.
- The letter E is in the word, but not in the 5th position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- An N in the 4th position: _ _ _ N _
- The letter E is present, but not in the 5th position. So it must be in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or A.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position, so we can try it in position 1, 2, or 3).
- Avoids the letters C, R, A.
- Uses other common letters to test.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 6 tries.

Let's think of words that fit:
- The pattern: _ _ _ N _
- With E in one of the first three positions.

Possible positions for E:
- Position 1: E _ _ N _
- Position 2: _ E _ N _
- Position 3: _ _ E N _

We should also try to include other common consonants to get more information.

Common consonants we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using the letters we know are absent: C, R, A.

Let me try to come up with a word that has N in the 4th position and E in a different position, and includes other common letters.

Option 1: Put E in the first position: E _ _ N _
We need to fill the second and third positions with letters that are not C, R, A, and are common.

Possible words: 
- ""EJECT"" -> but has C and J is not common? Also, we know C is absent, so no.
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but we need N in the 4th? No, the 4th is O? Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words ending with N? But wait, the 4th is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _.

So for E in position 1: E _ _ N _

Possible words:
- ""EATEN"" -> but E is in position 1 and 5? We know A is absent, so no.
- ""EXCEL"" -> has C and X, and also C is absent? No.
- ""EDEN"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word? 
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

Common words: 
- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.

Perhaps E in position 2: _ E _ N _

Words:
- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N, but the 4th letter is I? No, we need the 4th to be N. So the pattern is _ E _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and 5th is something.

In ""BEGIN"", the letters are: B (1), E (2), G (3), I (4), N (5). So the 4th is I and 5th is N? That doesn't match because we need the 4th to be N.

We need the 4th to be N, so the word must have the 4th letter as N.

So for _ E _ N _:
- The first letter: ?
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: ?
- Fourth letter: N
- Fifth letter: ?

So the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

We know E is in the word, but not in the 5th position. We are putting it in the 2nd.

Possible words:
- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N, but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N? Actually, the 4th is O and 5th is N? That's not the same as having N in the 4th.

Wait, let me clarify the positions:
- Position 1: first letter
- Position 2: second letter
- Position 3: third letter
- Position 4: fourth letter (which is N)
- Position 5: fifth letter

So for a word with E in the second position and N in the fourth: the pattern is: ? E ? N ?

For example, ""SENT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Possible words:
- ""SENT"" is 4, so not.
- ""SENTN"" is not a word.

Actually, common words:
- ""LEMON"" -> L E M O N -> but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N. So the 4th is not N.

I need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.

For example:
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can't use A.

We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

Similarly, we cannot use C, R, A.

So let's try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).

Pattern: ? E ? N ?

We need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.

- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.

- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.

But we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.

Also, we are using B, I, G. We don't know about these letters.

But note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.

Also, we are testing B, I, G.

But we must avoid A, C, R.

""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.

N is in the 4th position, which is correct.

E is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.

We also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.

Another possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.

""SENT"" is too short.

""LEMON"" -> same issue.

""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.

We need the 4th to be N.

So the word must be: ? ? ? N ?

With E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?

Words:
- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.
- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.
- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.

""EDEN"" is 4 letters.

""EXCON"" -> not a word.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:

Position 1: first letter
Position 2: second letter
Position 3: third letter
Position 4: fourth letter = N
Position 5: fifth letter

So the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

We want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.

Case 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]

We need a word: E ? ? N ?

Examples:
- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.
- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

Words:
- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.
- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.

We need the 4th to be N.

So [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.

We need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.

So the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.

So for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]

Examples:
- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.

- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.

- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

I see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.

We need the fourth letter to be N.

So the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]

And E must be in one of the first three positions.

So for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

What words fit this?
- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.
- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.

In ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Common words: 
- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.

- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.

- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.

- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.

But we have E to include? We don't have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.

We should include E to test its position.

So we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).

Let me list words with N in the 4th position.

For example:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Another example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.

""IRON"" is 4 letters.

""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So let's think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

For example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.

""LLANO"" -> not a common word.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.

I think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.

Another idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.

I see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.

Without A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.

But ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.

Therefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.

So for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.

""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] are not E? We don't know, but we can have other letters.

For example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.

""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.

Let me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.

So the word is: ... N ?

Like in ""URBAN"", but U R B A N -> R and A absent.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> A absent.

""TONIC"" -> T O N I C -> 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No.

""CONIC"" -> C is absent.

""LOGIC"" -> C absent.

""TOPIC"" -> C absent.

""DOZEN"" -> D O Z E N -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:Z, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E, not N.

""AXION"" -> A absent.

""OPIUM"" -> no E.

I'm struggling.

Perhaps E in position 2: [1] E [3] N [5]

[1] and [3] and [5] must be filled, and [5] cannot be E.

Examples:
- ""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.
- ""BEING"" -> 4th is I.
- ""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.
- ""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""SENT"" is 4 letters.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R is absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> T E P E E -> 4th is E, 5th is E.

But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

So we need the 5th to be something else.

What about ""BEVEL"" -> B E V E L -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""BEVY"" is 4 letters.

I think I need to consider that the word might have E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] and [5] are not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), U(3), N(4), T(5). Perfect.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""BLUNT"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me think: ""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCENE"" -> S C E N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""STONE"" -> S T O N E -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

So we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.

And the 4th is N.

Let me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]

[1] and [2] are not E, and [5] is not E.

Examples:
- ""BLUNT"" -> no E.
- ""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.
- ""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.
- ""SPINE"" -> has E in 5th.
- ""SHINE"" -> has E in 5th.

What about ""DEMON""? No, 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not common.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

I found one: ""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:N, 4:C, 5:E -> 4th is C, not N, and E in 5th.

Another: ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E, not N.

""LINEN"" -> L I N E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:N -> 4th is E.

Not matching.

""LENIN"" -> L E N I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:N, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 4th is N.

Let me search for words: ""BEGIN"" is not because 4th is I.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" is not.

""OZONE"" has E in 5th.

""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""SONIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N, 4th is O.

Not.

""SYNOD"" is S Y N O D, so 3rd is N, 4th is O.

We need the 4th to be N.

Let me think of words like ""MANGO"" but 4th is N? M A N G O -> 3rd is N, 4th is G.

""MANOR"" -> M A N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINOR"" -> M I N O R -> 3rd is N.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> 3rd is N.

I see the pattern: many words have N in the third position.

We need N in the fourth.

For example, ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> 4th is A? No.

""ORGAN"" -> O R G A N -> 4th is A.

""LOGAN"" -> 4th is A.

""TONAL"" -> T O N A L -> 3rd is N.

""CONGA"" -> C absent.

""SONGY"" -> not a word.

""DOING"" -> D O I N G -> 1:D, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this has N in the 4th.

And the 5th is G.

But does it have E? No.

We need a word that has E.

""DOING"" doesn't have E.

""FEIGN"" doesn't have E.

""REIGN"" doesn't have E.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEPEE"" has E but in 3rd and 5th, not 4th.

""LENIN"" has E in 2nd and 5th.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

I think I found one: ""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEINT"" -> F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in the 2nd position.

And the 5th is T.

And it does not have E in the 5th.

Also, it does not contain C, R, A.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid word.

It means to affect or show a feeling.

It's a bit obscure, but it's in the dictionary.

Another word: ""JEANT"" -> not common.

""PEINT"" -> not a word.

""REINT"" -> not common.

""WEINT"" -> not a word.

""HEINT"" -> not common.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" is not standard.

""TEIGN"" -> not common.

""VEINT"" -> not a word.

""BEING"" is not.

""FEIGN"" is not.

""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it does not have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to test its position.

We know E is in the word, so we must include E in the guess to get more information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know where E is.

So we should include E.

Therefore, ""STING"" doesn't have E, so it's not good.

""SPINE"" has E in 5th.

""SHINE"" has E in 5th.

""PHONE"" has E in 5th.

""STONE"" has E in 5th.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C is absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not N.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is a possibility.

Another word: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" -> not standard.

""TEPEE"" -> 4th is E.

""LEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

""FEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""FEINT"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""MOUNT"" -> M O U N T -> 1:M, 2:O, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

And it has no E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E.

""MOUNT"" doesn't have E.

Similarly, ""COUNT"" -> C absent.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> 1:P, 2:O, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOIST"" -> M O I S T -> no E.

We need a word that has E and N in the 4th.

Let me try ""BEING"" but it has I in the 4th.

I think ""FEINT"" is acceptable.

Another word: ""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 1.

""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

Position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, and not C, R, A.

For example:
- ""EJECT"" invalid.
- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.
- ""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.
- ""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.

I found ""E"" in position 1, 2, or 3.

""ELINT"" -> E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> yes! The 4th is N.

And E is in position 1.

And it has no E in the 5th.

And it doesn't have C, R, A.

""ELINT"" is a word? It might be, but let's see: ELINT is a type of intelligence gathering, so it's valid.

But is it common? Maybe not.

Another word: ""EXIST"" -> E X I S T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""EDUCN"" not a word.

""EDUC"" is 4 letters.

""EDUCAT"" is 6 letters.

""EDUCE"" -> E D U C E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""EDUCE"" has C and E in 5th.

Not.

""EGEST"" -> E G E S T -> 1:E, 2:G, 3:E, 4:S, 5:T -> 4th is S.

Not.

""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W -> 4th is O.

Not.

""ELUDE"" -> 4th is D.

""EMBOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENDOW"" -> 4th is O.

""ENJOY"" -> E N J O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:J, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""ENACT"" -> E N A C T -> A and C absent.

""ENACT"" is not.

""ENACT"" has A and C.

""ENTER"" -> E N T E R -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> 4th is E.

Not.

""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:V, 4:O, 5:Y -> 2nd is N.

Not.

""EPHAS"" not a word.

""EPHAS"" no.

""ERUPT"" -> E R U P T -> R absent.

""ESKU"" not a word.

I think ""ELINT"" is a possibility, but it's obscure.

Another common word: ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

And it has no E, but we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get information about its position.

If we don't include E, we won't know if E is in position 2 or not.

We should include E.

So let's go back to ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T

This has E in position 2, and N in position 4.

It has F, I, T.

And no C, R, A.

So it's valid.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 3.

""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""FLINT"" -> F L I N T -> no E.

""GLINT"" -> G L I N T -> no E.

""SPINE"" -> S P I N E -> 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> E in 5th.

Not allowed.

""SHINE"" -> same.

""STONE"" -> same.

""PHONE"" -> same.

""SCONE"" -> S C O N E -> C absent, and E in 5th.

""SONES"" -> S O N E S -> 1:S, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S -> 4th is E.

Not.

""SONIC"" has C.

I think ""FEINT"" is the only common word I can think of that fits: F E I N T

But let's confirm: 
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: T

And E is in position 2, which is a new position.

We can use this to test if E is in position 2.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

If we get a dash, then E is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in 1 or 3).

If we get an x, but we know E is in the word, so it can't be x.

So ""FEINT"" is a valid guess.

We can also consider ""DEIGN"" but it has E in position 2 and 4th is G, not N.

Another word: ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I.

Not.

""BEING"" -> 4th is I.

I think ""FEINT"" is a good choice, even if it's obscure.

We can use ""FEINT"".

But let's see if there's a more common word.

""BEGIN"" is not.

""BEING"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" is not.

Perhaps ""E"" in position 2.

""DEMON"" -> 4th is O.

""DEIGN"" -> 4th is G.

""REIGN"" -> R absent.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

""FEINT"" is the only common one I can think of.

Another one: ""MEANY"" -> M E A N Y -> A absent.

""MEANY"" has A.

""PEONY"" -> P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N! Yes.

And E is in position 2.

And it has P, O, Y.

And no C, R, A.

""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower).

So we have two options: ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"".

""FEINT"" has E in position 2, and ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Both have E in position 2.

We can choose one.

""FEINT"" is less common, but ""PEONY"" is also less common.

But ""PEONY"" is a flower, so it might be accepted.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

""REIGN"" is not.

""SEIGN"" not standard.

""TEIGN"" not common.

""VEINT"" not a word.

""HEINT"" not common.

""WEINT"" not common.

""BEING"" not.

So between ""FEINT"" and ""PEONY"", I'll choose ""PEONY"" because it's a common enough word.

But let's see the feedback we got: E is in the word but not in the 5th, so if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's correct, we get a check, if not, we get a dash.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we don't have E, then we know E is in position 1 or 3.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2.

Similarly, ""FEINT"" has E in position 2.

I think ""PEONY"" is a good choice.

But let's confirm the pattern: P E O N Y -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:O, 4:N, 5:Y -> 4th is N.

Yes.

And E is in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so if it's not in position 2, we get a dash for E.

If we get a check for E, then we know E is in position 2.

Also, we test P, O, Y.

If we get dashes, we know E is in 1 or 3.

So it's good.

Similarly, for ""FEINT"": F E I N T -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

E in position 2.

We know E is in the word, so same as above.

But ""FEINT"" is less common, so ""PEONY"" might be better.

Another word: ""BEING"" is not.

""DEMON"" is not.

I think ""PEONY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 1.

For example, ""E"" in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]

[2] and [3] and [5] are not E, not C, R, A.

[2] and [3] can be various letters.

For example, ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5? ""E S I N T"" -> ""ESINT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""E D U N T"" -> ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""E L I N G"" -> ""ELING"" not a word.

""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> E in 1, L in 2, I in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

Yes, ""ELINT"" is a word.

It's a valid English word.

So we have options: ""FEINT"", ""PEONY"", ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" has E in position 1.

We can choose ""ELINT"".

But ""ELINT"" has L, I, T.

""PEONY"" has P, O, Y.

""FEINT"" has F, I, T.

I think ""ELINT"" is a good choice because it has E in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1, 2, or 3.

By putting E in position 1, we test if it's in position 1.

If we get a check, great. If not, we get a dash, so E is in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So ""ELINT"" is a good guess.

Similarly, ""PEONY"" tests P, O, Y.

I think ""ELINT"" is better because it has more common letters.

""ELINT"" is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the pattern: E L I N T -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:N, 5:T -> 4th is N.

Yes.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

We'll get feedback on E, L, I, N, T.

N is already correct, so we expect a check for N.

E will be a dash or check.

L, I, T will be tested.

So it's good.

Another common word: ""STING"" doesn't have E.

""POINT"" -> P O I N T -> no E.

""JOINT"" -> same.

""MOINT"" not a word.

""MOUNT"" -> no E.

I think ""ELINT"" is fine.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word with E in position 3.

For example, ""AXION"" has A and X.

""IONIC"" has C.

""LOGIC"" has C.

""TONIC"" has C.

""CONIC"" has C.

""SYNOD"" -> S Y N O D -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""SYNCH"" -> S Y N C H -> C absent.

""SYNOD"" not.

""SYNCH"" not.

""DYING"" -> D Y I N G -> 1:D, 2:Y, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> 4th is N.

But no E.

We need E.

""DYING"" doesn't have E.

""FLING"" -> F L I N G -> no E.

""SLING"" -> S L I N G -> no E.

""SWING"" -> S W I N G -> no E.

""THING"" -> T H I N G -> no E.

""BLIND"" -> B L I N D -> no E.

""GRIND"" -> G R I N D -> R absent.

""FINCH"" -> F I N C H -> C absent.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> C absent and E in 5th.

Not.

""MINIM"" -> M I N I M -> 3rd is N.

Not.

""VINYL"" -> V I N Y L -> 3rd is N.

Not.

I think it's hard to find a word with E and N in the 4th.

So ""ELINT"" or ""PEONY"" or ""FEINT"".

I'll go with ""ELINT"" because it's more common.

So second guess: ""ELINT""

But let's write it.

<guess>elint</guess>

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

""PEONY"" is also common enough.

But ""PEONY"" has E in position 2, same as ""ELINT"".

""ELINT"" is E in position 1.

I think either is fine.

Perhaps ""STING"" but it doesn't have E, so we skip.

No, we must include E.

So I choose ""ELINT"".

But let's see if there's a word like ""E"" in 1, ""S"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ESINT"" is not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""D"" in 2, ""U"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""EDUNT"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""I"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""G"" in 5: ""ELING"" not a word.

""E"" in 1, ""L"" in 2, ""D"" in 3, ""N"" in 4, ""T"" in 5: ""ELINT"" is E L I N T -> valid.

So I'll go with ""ELINT"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in position 1.

If E is in position 1, we get a check.

If not, we get a dash and know it's in 2 or 3.

Also, we test L, I, T.

So it's good.

Another word: ""DEMON"" is not.

""DEIGN"" is not.

I think ""ELINT"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""ELINT"".

But let's confirm the word: ELINT is a valid 5-letter word.

Yes.

So second guess: ELINT

In the feedback, we have E not in 5th, so in ""ELINT"", E is in 1.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are absent (x).
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓).
- E is present but not in the 5th position (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word has N in the 4th position (e.g., _ _ _ N _).
- E is in the word but not in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Avoid using C, R, or A.

For the second guess, I chose ""elint"" because:
- It includes E (testing position 1) and N (position 4), which are known to be in the word.
- It avoids C, R, A.
- It tests new common letters (F, I, T) to gather more information.
- The pattern fits: E in position 1 (testing if E is in position 1), L in position 2, I in position 3, N in position 4 (confirmed), T in position 5.

This guess will help narrow down the position of E and test three new letters.

Also, we know C is absent, so no.\n- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but we need N in the 4th? No, the 4th is O? Not matching.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nLet me think of words ending with N? But wait, the 4th is N, so the word is _ _ _ N _.\n\nSo for E in position 1: E _ _ N _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""EATEN"" -> but E is in position 1 and 5? We know A is absent, so no.\n- ""EXCEL"" -> has C and X, and also C is absent? No.\n- ""EDEN"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word? \n- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ELBOW"" -> E L B O W, but the 4th letter is O, not N. So no.\n\nPerhaps E in position 2: _ E _ N _\n\nWords:\n- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N, but the 4th letter is I? No, we need the 4th to be N. So the pattern is _ E _ N _ -> so the 4th is N, and 5th is something.\n\nIn ""BEGIN"", the letters are: B (1), E (2), G (3), I (4), N (5). So the 4th is I and 5th is N? That doesn\'t match because we need the 4th to be N.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N, so the word must have the 4th letter as N.\n\nSo for _ E _ N _:\n- The first letter: ?\n- Second letter: E\n- Third letter: ?\n- Fourth letter: N\n- Fifth letter: ?\n\nSo the pattern is: ? E ? N ?\n\nWe know E is in the word, but not in the 5th position. We are putting it in the 2nd.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N, but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N? Actually, the 4th is O and 5th is N? That\'s not the same as having N in the 4th.\n\nWait, let me clarify the positions:\n- Position 1: first letter\n- Position 2: second letter\n- Position 3: third letter\n- Position 4: fourth letter (which is N)\n- Position 5: fifth letter\n\nSo for a word with E in the second position and N in the fourth: the pattern is: ? E ? N ?\n\nFor example, ""SENT"" is 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SENT"" is 4, so not.\n- ""SENTN"" is not a word.\n\nActually, common words:\n- ""LEMON"" -> L E M O N -> but the 4th letter is O? No, the 4th is O and 5th is N. So the 4th is not N.\n\nI need to think of words that have the 4th letter as N.\n\nFor example:\n- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:K -> but A is absent, so we can\'t use A.\n\nWe know A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C, R, A.\n\nSo let\'s try to find words with N in the 4th position and E in the word (but not in the 5th, and we are considering position 2).\n\nPattern: ? E ? N ?\n\nWe need to fill the first, third, and fifth positions with letters that are not C, R, A.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> positions: 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> but the 4th is G, not N. So no.\n\n- ""DEVON"" -> D E V O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> no.\n\n- ""BEING"" -> B E I N G -> 4th is N? Yes: 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> perfect.\n\nBut we have E in the second position, which is good because we know E is in the word and we are testing it in position 2.\n\nAlso, we are using B, I, G. We don\'t know about these letters.\n\nBut note: we know E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 2. If the word has E in position 2, then we get a check. If not, but E is in the word, we get a dash.\n\nAlso, we are testing B, I, G.\n\nBut we must avoid A, C, R.\n\n""BEING"" does not contain A, C, R. It contains B, E, I, N, G.\n\nN is in the 4th position, which is correct.\n\nE is in the 2nd position, which is what we are testing.\n\nWe also know that E is not in the 5th, which is already satisfied.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 4th is O, 5th is N -> so the 4th is not N.\n\n""SENT"" is too short.\n\n""LEMON"" -> same issue.\n\n""TONES"" -> T O N E S -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is S. The 4th is not N.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? ? N ?\n\nWith E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nLet me try E in position 1: E ? ? N ?\n\nWords:\n- ""EATEN"" -> has A, which is absent -> invalid.\n- ""ELBORN"" -> not a word.\n- ""EAGON"" -> not a word.\n\n""EDEN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""EXCON"" -> not a word.\n\n""ENVOY"" -> E N V O Y -> but the 4th is O? And 5th is Y. The 4th is not N.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the positions.\n\nLet me list the positions for a 5-letter word with 4th as N:\n\nPosition 1: first letter\nPosition 2: second letter\nPosition 3: third letter\nPosition 4: fourth letter = N\nPosition 5: fifth letter\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] [3] N [5]\n\nWe want to test E in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nCase 1: E in position 1 -> E [2] [3] N [5]\n\nWe need a word: E ? ? N ?\n\nExamples:\n- ""EJECT"" -> has C, absent -> invalid.\n- ""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D? No.\n- ""EVOKE"" -> E V O K E -> 4th is K? No.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find common words with E in the first position and N in the fourth.\n\nLet me try E in position 3: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nWords:\n- ""BLUES"" -> B L U E S -> 4th is E? No.\n- ""TREES"" -> T R E E S -> but R is absent, and 4th is E? No.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nExamples:\n- ""DINER"" -> D I N E R -> but the 4th is E? And 5th is R? The 4th is E and 5th is R? No: D(1), I(2), N(3), E(4), R(5) -> but we need the 4th to be N, so this has N in the 3rd and E in the 4th. Not matching.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N, so the third letter is E and the fourth is N.\n\nSo the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> but the 3rd is N? And 4th is I? No: D(1), E(2), N(3), I(4), M(5) -> so the 4th is I, not N.\n\nI think I have a mistake: the pattern is: position 4 is N, so the third letter is the one before N.\n\nSo for E in the third position: the word is [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nExamples:\n- ""BEGUN"" -> B E G U N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:U, 5:N -> but the 4th is U, not N.\n\n- ""BEGIN"" -> B E G I N -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:G, 4:I, 5:N -> 4th is I, not N.\n\n- ""DEMON"" -> D E M O N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:M, 4:O, 5:N -> 4th is O.\n\nI see the pattern: the fourth letter is always something else.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be N.\n\nSo the word must be: [1] [2] [3] N [5]\n\nAnd E must be in one of the first three positions.\n\nSo for E in the third position: [1] [2] E N [5]\n\nWhat words fit this?\n- ""AXEN"" is 4 letters.\n- ""OZONE"" -> O Z O N E -> 1:O, 2:Z, 3:O, 4:N, 5:E -> this has E in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because E is not in the 5th (from feedback: E is in the word but not in the 5th). So we cannot have E in the 5th.\n\nIn ""OZONE"", E is in the 5th, which is not allowed by the feedback (E is not in the 5th). So we cannot use words that have E in the 5th.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern [1] [2] E N [5], the 5th letter must not be E, and also must be a letter that can form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DENIM"" -> D E N I M -> 4th is I, not N.\n\nI think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BLANK"" -> B L A N K -> but A is absent, and also the 4th is N? Yes: B(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5). But A is absent, so invalid.\n\n- ""PLANK"" -> P L A N K -> A absent.\n\n- ""THANK"" -> T H A N K -> A absent.\n\n- ""STING"" -> S T I N G -> 1:S, 2:T, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G -> this fits: S T I N G.\n\nBut we have E to include? We don\'t have to include E in this guess? Actually, we should include E because we know it\'s in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nBut we are not required to include E in the guess? We can guess without E? But we know E is in the word, so it would be inefficient to not include E.\n\nWe should include E to test its position.\n\nSo we need a word that has E and N (with N in the 4th).\n\nLet me list words with N in the 4th position.\n\nFor example:\n- ""BLUNT"" -> B L U N T -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:T -> this has N in the 4th.\n\nBut does it have E? No.\n\nWe need a word that has E and N in the 4th.\n\nAnother example: ""ADORN"" -> but A and R are absent.\n\n""IRON"" is 4 letters.\n\n""OZONE"" has E in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\n""ENTIA"" -> E N T I A -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:I, 5:A -> but N is in the 2nd, not 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that end with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.\n\nFor example, words like ""CACTI"" but C is absent.\n\n""LLANO"" -> not a common word.\n\n""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but C is absent, and also the 4th is C? No.\n\nI think I need to search for words that have the structure: ??N? but with E in one of the first three.\n\nAnother idea: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.\n\n""DEVON"" -> 4th is O.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""BEING"" -> 4th is I.\n\n""FEIGN"" -> F E I G N -> 1:F, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> 4th is G.\n\nI see the pattern: most common words with N in the 4th are like ""BLANK"", ""PLANK"", ""THANK"", but they have A.\n\nWithout A: ""BLUNT"", ""FLINT"", ""GLINT"", ""SPINE"", ""SHINE"", etc.\n\nBut ""SHINE"" -> S H I N E -> 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E -> but E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot use words that end with E in the 5th.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern [1] [2] [3] N [5], the 5th must not be E.\n\nSo for example, ""SPINE"" has E in the 5th.\n\n""SHINE"" has E in the 5th.\n\n""PHONE"" -> P H O N E -> 4th is N? Yes: P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But E is in the 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we need a word that has E in position 1, 2, or 3, and the 5th is not E.\n\nAnd the 4th is N.\n\nLet me try E in position 1: E [2] [3] N [5]\n\n[2] and [3] are not E? We don\'t know, but we can have other letters.\n\nFor example, ""EJECT"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""ELUDE"" -> E L U D E -> 4th is D.\n\n""EMBOW"" -> E M B O W -> 4th is O.\n\n""ENDOW"" -> E N D O W -> 1:E, 2:N, 3:D, 4:O, 5:W -> 2nd is N, not 4th.\n\nI think I need to look for words that have N as the fourth letter.\n\nLet me search for words ending with ""N"" as the fourth letter? Actually, no, the fourth letter is the one before the last.\n\nSo the word is: ...

We are given feedback for the second guess ""elint"":
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)

From the first guess, we already knew:
- N is in the 4th position (from ""crane"" feedback: N(✓))
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (from ""crane"" feedback: E(-))
- C, R, A are not in the word (from ""crane"" feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x))

Now, from ""elint"" feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for E, meaning it's present but not in position 1)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (since L(-) means it's present but not in position 2)
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (I(-) means it's present but not in position 3)
- N is still correct in position 4 (✓)
- T is not in the word (x)

So, combining all information:

Known correct:
- Position 4 is N: so the word is _ _ _ N _

Known present letters (but wrong positions):
- E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""elint"" feedback). Since the word has 5 letters, E must be in position 3 (the only position left, since position 4 is N and position 1,2,5 are ruled out). 
  - From ""crane"": E not in 5th
  - From ""elint"": E not in 1st, and not in 2nd (because we put E in position 1 and got - meaning it's not there, and we know from ""crane"" it's not in 5th). So E must be in position 3.

- L is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback: L(-) at position 2). It could be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 3 might be taken by E? Not necessarily, since E is not in position 3 yet? Actually, we haven't tested position 3 for L.

But note: we are about to deduce that E must be in position 3.

Also, I is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""elint"" feedback: I(-) at position 3). I could be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, T is absent.

Absent letters: C, R, A, T.

So, the word has:
- E in position 3? Not yet confirmed, but we are about to conclude that.
- L in some position (not 2)
- I in some position (not 3)
- N in position 4.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, T.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from ""elint"" feedback: E not in 1), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, L could be here? Or I? Or other.

Position 2: unknown, but cannot be L (from ""elint"" feedback: L not in 2), cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, I could be here? Or E? But E is not in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback: E not in 1, and we know E is in position 3? Not yet confirmed).

Position 3: must be E? Because E is in the word and the only position left is 3? Since position 4 is N, and positions 1,2,5 are either occupied by other letters or ruled out for E.

Positions:
1: not E (from feedback)
1: not C, R, A, T
2: not L (from feedback) and not C, R, A, T
3: ? 
4: N (fixed)
5: ? 

E must be in the word, and it can't be in 1,2, or 5. Therefore, it must be in position 3.

So, we can deduce that position 3 is E.

Then, the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Now, we know L and I are in the word, but not in position 2 and 3 respectively? Position 3 is E, so I cannot be in position 3.

L is not in position 2.

Also, I is not in position 3.

L could be in position 1 or 5.

I could be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

But we have constraints:

Position 1: cannot be E (deduced), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, it might be L or I or other.

Position 2: cannot be L (from feedback), and cannot be C, R, A, T. It could be I or other.

Position 5: cannot be E (from first feedback), and cannot be C, R, A, T. It could be L or I or other.

Also, the word must contain L and I, and we have two positions: 1,2,5 to fill, but with L and I and one more letter? Since we have three known letters: E, L, I, and one unknown.

The word has E, L, I, N, and one more letter? Because we have five positions, and we know four letters: E, L, I, N. So the fifth letter is unknown.

But we know the word has exactly these four, and one more.

The known letters are E, L, I, N. So the fifth letter is additional.

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A, T.

Now, we need to form a word of the form [1] [2] E N [5], with [1] and [2] and [5] being letters that are not C, R, A, T, and must include L and I in positions 1,2, or 5, but with constraints.

Specifically:
- Position 1: can be L? Yes, because L is not forbidden for position 1.
- Position 2: can be I? Yes, because I is not forbidden for position 2? But from feedback, I is not in position 3, but it can be in 2.
- Position 5: can be L or I? Or other.

But we know L and I are in the word, so they must appear in positions 1,2,5.

However, position 1 cannot be E, and E is in position 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be E (from first feedback).

Now, let's list possible words.

The word pattern: [1] [2] E N [5]

With [1] and [2] and [5] being letters not in {C, R, A, T} and must include L and I.

Also, L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback), and I cannot be in position 3.

So for position 2, if we put I, that's allowed because position 3 is E, so I cannot be there.

Position 1: can be L or I or other, but must include L and I.

Position 5: can be L or I or other.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

Option 1: Position 1 is L, position 2 is I, position 5 is something.

Word: L I E N [5]

What can [5] be? It must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and the word must exist.

Possible: ""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENS"" -> L I E N S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:E, 4:N, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

And S is not in the absent list (C, R, A, T are absent, S is not mentioned, so S is possible).

Also, ""LIENS"" is a word (plural of lien).

Option 2: Position 1 is I, position 2 is L? But L cannot be in position 2? From ""elint"" feedback, L is not in position 2, so if we put I in position 1 and L in position 2, that would be invalid because L cannot be in position 2.

In ""elint"", we had L in position 2 and got L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

So for position 2, if we put I, that's allowed because position 3 is E, so I is not forced to avoid position 2? Position 2 can be I.

But if we put L in position 1, then position 2 must be something else, and position 5 something.

So:

Case 1: Position 1 = L, position 2 = I, position 5 = X -> word: L I E N X

X must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and ""LIEN"" + X? ""LIENS"" is one.

Other words? ""LIENT"" not a word.

""LIENS"" is one.

Case 2: Position 1 = L, position 2 = X, position 5 = I -> word: L X E N I

But position 5 is I, which is allowed? I is not forbidden for position 5? Only forbidden for position 3.

So ""L X E N I"" -> words like ""LEXIN"" not a word.

""LITEN"" -> L I T E N -> but T is absent (from ""elint"" feedback: T(x)), so cannot use T.

""LIVEN"" -> L I V E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:V? But we need E in position 3? ""LIVEN"" is L I V E N -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:N -> but we need position 3 to be E, not position 4. So no.

We need position 3 to be E, so for case 2: position 1=L, position 2=X, position 5=I -> word: L X E N I -> but that would be L X E N I, so position 3 is E, position 4=N, position 5=I.

Is there a word like that? ""LUNGI"" not a word.

""LEXIN"" not.

""LEVIN"" -> L E V I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:V, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 3 is V, not E. We need position 3 to be E.

So not.

""LIBEL"" -> L I B E L -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> position 3 is B, not E.

Not matching.

So case 2 doesn't yield a common word.

Case 3: Position 1 = I, position 2 = L, position 5 = X -> word: I L E N X -> ""ILENS"" is not a word, but ""ILEN"" is 4 letters.

""I"" in position 1, ""L"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in position 4, and position 5=X.

What words? ""ILIAN"" -> I L I A N -> A absent, and also position 3 is I, not E.

""I L E N X"" -> ""ILENX"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=X, position 5=I -> word: I X E N I -> ""IXENI"" not a word.

Not.

So case 3 doesn't work.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 1: position 1=L, position 2=I, position 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

But ""LIENS"" has S in position 5.

Another possibility: position 1=L, position 2=X, position 5=I -> but we need a word, like ""LUCRE"" but C and R absent, and position 3 is U, not E.

Not.

""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

So ""LIENS"" seems a candidate.

But we have position 5=I? In ""LIENS"", position 5 is S, not I.

In case 1, we have position 1=L, 2=I, 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

Position 5 is S.

But we know E is in position 3, so in ""LIENS"", it's L I E N S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:E, 4:N, 5:S.

This matches the pattern.

Now, we need to check if it fits all feedback.

First, from ""crane"": 
- We had E in position 5? In ""crane"", E was in position 5, but in the secret word, E is in position 3, so position 5 is S, which is not E, so that's fine.

From ""elint"":
- E in position 1: we got E(-), meaning E is not in position 1, which is consistent because E is in position 3.
- L in position 2: we got L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In ""LIENS"", L is in position 1, not 2, so that's fine.
- I in position 3: we got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. In ""LIENS"", I is in position 2, not 3, so that's fine.
- N in position 4: correct.
- T: absent, and ""LIENS"" has no T, so T(x) is consistent.

Also, the word ""LIENS"" does not contain C, R, A, T, so it's valid.

But is ""LIENS"" a word? It is the plural of ""lien"", meaning a security device or a bond.

It's acceptable.

Another word? What about ""LIKEN""? Not a common word.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about position 5=I? For example, ""LIENI"" not a word.

""LITIE"" -> L I T I E -> T absent, and position 4 is I? Not N.

Not.

""LIVID"" -> L I V I D -> position 4 is I, not N.

Not.

So ""LIENS"" seems the most likely.

But we have another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could E be in position 3, and another E? But we don't have any indication of duplicate letters so far.

In ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and got dash, meaning E is present but not in 5, but it doesn't say anything about duplicates. Similarly, in ""elint"", E in position 1 got dash, meaning E is present but not in 1. But it could be that E appears twice? However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in this case, with E in position 3, and position 5 is S, there's no duplicate E issue.

Another word: ""LIKEN"" is not standard.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""LIENS"" for the third guess.

But we are not yet sure.

We have to guess.

Since we have limited tries, and ""LIENS"" fits, we can guess it.

But let's see if there is another word with E in position 3 and N in 4.

For example, ""BLUEN"" not a word.

""FLUEN"" not.

""GLUEN"" not.

""PLUEN"" not.

""SLUEN"" not.

""BEIGE"" -> B E I G E -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:E -> position 3 is I, not E, and E in 5th.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> position 3 is I, not E.

Not.

So ""LIENS"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure about the position of E.

We deduced that E must be in position 3 because it can't be in 1,2,5, and 4 is N.

Also, in position 3, it can be, and we have no feedback contradicting.

Moreover, in ""elint"", we had I in position 3 and got I(-), meaning I is not in position 3, but that doesn't affect E's position.

So the word should be [1] [2] E N [5]

With [1] and [2] and [5] not in {C, R, A, T}

And L and I must be in [1], [2], or [5], but with constraints:
- L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback)
- I cannot be in position 3 (from ""elint"" feedback)

In ""LIENS"", L is in position 1, I is in position 2, both within allowed positions.

Also, position 5 is S, which is not forbidden.

Another word: ""LIKEN"" is not standard, but ""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible 5-letter words with pattern [1] [2] E N [5], not containing C, R, A, T.

[1] and [2] and [5] are letters not in {C, R, A, T}

And the word must contain L and I.

Also, L cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 3.

So:

- If [1]=L, [2]=I, [5]=S -> ""LIENS""
- If [1]=L, [2]=X, [5]=I -> what word? For example, ""LUCRE"" has C and R absent. ""LITEN"" has T absent. ""LIVEN"" has V, but position 3 is V, not E. ""LUBEN"" not common. ""LUMEN"" -> L U M E N -> 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N -> position 3 is M, not E. Not.

""LIENS"" is the only common word I can think of.

""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENF"" not a word.

So ""LIENS"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that I could be in position 1 or 5.

For example, if position 1 = I, position 2 = L, position 5 = X -> word: I L E N X

What words? ""ILEN"" is 4 letters. ""ILENS"" is not a word. ""ILEAC"" not.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=L, position 5=I -> word: I L E N I -> ""ILENI"" not a word. ""ILYEN"" not.

Not.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=L -> word: I L E N L -> ""ILENL"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=X -> word: I X E N X -> ""IXENX"" not a word.

So no common words.

Therefore, the only common word is ""LIENS"".

Moreover, in ""LIENS"", we have:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: S

Now, check against feedback:

From ""crane"": E was in position 5, but in the secret word, position 5 is S, so E is in position 3, which is fine.

From ""elint"": 
- E in position 1: secret has E in position 3, so E is present but not in 1 (dash), correct.
- L in position 2: secret has L in position 1, so L is present but not in 2 (dash), correct.
- I in position 3: secret has I in position 2, so I is present but not in 3 (dash), correct.
- N in position 4: correct.
- T: absent, and ""LIENS"" has no T, correct.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, T, which is good.

So ""LIENS"" should be the guess.

But let's see if there is another possibility.

What if the word has L in position 5? For example, position 1=?, position 2=?, position 3=E, position 4=N, position 5=L.

Then the word is ? ? E N L

And I must be in position 1 or 2.

For example, position 1=I, position 2=? , position 5=L -> word: I ? E N L

What can be in position 2? It must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and the word must contain I.

Possible: ""I"" in position 2, then position 5=L, so ""I L E N L"" -> ""ILENL"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=X, position 5=L -> ""I X E N L"" -> ""IXEL L"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=X -> ""I X E N X"" not a word.

So no common words.

Similarly, position 1=?, position 2=I, position 5=L -> "" ? I E N L"" -> ""X I E N L"" -> ""X"" must be a letter, e.g., ""MIENL"" not a word.

So only ""LIENS"" works.

Therefore, we guess ""LIENS"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

In ""elint"", we had I in position 3 and got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. In ""LIENS"", I is in position 2, so that's fine.

Similarly, L is in position 1, not 2, fine.

E is in position 3, not 1 or 2 or 5, so must be 3, fine.

N in 4, fine.

So ""LIENS"" should be the guess.

But we have to make sure about the position of E. We deduced it must be in position 3.

Is it possible that E is in position 3 and we are correct.

To be thorough, let's see if there is any other word that fits the pattern and the constraints.

Suppose position 1=L, position 2=I, position 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

Position 1=I, position 2=L, position 5=S -> ""ILiens"" not a word, but ""ILIEN"" is 5 letters? ""ILIEN"" is not standard.

""ILIAD"" has A and not N.

So I think ""LIENS"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""LIENS"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 1 or 2 or 5, so position 3 is the only option.

So the guess is ""LIENS"".

But let's write it.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  
  - N is in the 4th position (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - C, R, A are absent.  

- **Guess 2: elint** → Feedback: E(-), L(-), I(-), N(✓), T(x)  
  - E is in the word but not in the 1st position (and not in 2nd or 5th, from prior feedback; thus E must be in the 3rd position).  
  - L is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
  - I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
  - N remains correct in the 4th position.  
  - T is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed position**: Position 4 is N (from both guesses).  
- **E's position**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from feedback). Since position 4 is N, E must be in position 3.  
- **L and I**: Both are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  
  - L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"").  
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from ""elint"").  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T are not in the word.  
- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `[1] [2] E N [5]`, where:  
  - `[1]` and `[2]` cannot be L or I if they are to be placed there later.  
  - `[5]` cannot be E (from ""crane"").  
- **Constraints for L and I**:  
  - L must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).  
  - I must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (position 3 is invalid).  

### Solving for the word:
- The only common English word fitting `[1] [2] E N [5]` is **""LIENS""** (plural of ""lien""), where:  
  - `[1] = L` (testing L in position 1).  
  - `[2] = I` (testing I in position 2).  
  - `[3] = E` (confirmed position).  
  - `[4] = N` (confirmed).  
  - `[5] = S` (testing S in position 5).  
- This word satisfies all feedback:  
  - E is in position 3 (not 1, 2, or 5).  
  - L is present but not in position 2.  
  - I is present but not in position 3.  
  - No C, R, A, or T.  
- If correct, this guess could win.

<guess>liens</guess>",liens,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""elint"":
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)

From the first guess, we already knew:
- N is in the 4th position (from ""crane"" feedback: N(✓))
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (from ""crane"" feedback: E(-))
- C, R, A are not in the word (from ""crane"" feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x))

Now, from ""elint"" feedback:
- E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got - for E, meaning it's present but not in position 1)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (since L(-) means it's present but not in position 2)
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (I(-) means it's present but not in position 3)
- N is still correct in position 4 (✓)
- T is not in the word (x)

So, combining all information:

Known correct:
- Position 4 is N: so the word is _ _ _ N _

Known present letters (but wrong positions):
- E is in the word, but not in position 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"" and ""elint"" feedback). Since the word has 5 letters, E must be in position 3 (the only position left, since position 4 is N and position 1,2,5 are ruled out). 
  - From ""crane"": E not in 5th
  - From ""elint"": E not in 1st, and not in 2nd (because we put E in position 1 and got - meaning it's not there, and we know from ""crane"" it's not in 5th). So E must be in position 3.

- L is in the word, but not in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback: L(-) at position 2). It could be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 3 might be taken by E? Not necessarily, since E is not in position 3 yet? Actually, we haven't tested position 3 for L.

But note: we are about to deduce that E must be in position 3.

Also, I is in the word, but not in position 3 (from ""elint"" feedback: I(-) at position 3). I could be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, T is absent.

Absent letters: C, R, A, T.

So, the word has:
- E in position 3? Not yet confirmed, but we are about to conclude that.
- L in some position (not 2)
- I in some position (not 3)
- N in position 4.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, T.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

Position 1: unknown, but cannot be E (from ""elint"" feedback: E not in 1), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, L could be here? Or I? Or other.

Position 2: unknown, but cannot be L (from ""elint"" feedback: L not in 2), cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, I could be here? Or E? But E is not in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback: E not in 1, and we know E is in position 3? Not yet confirmed).

Position 3: must be E? Because E is in the word and the only position left is 3? Since position 4 is N, and positions 1,2,5 are either occupied by other letters or ruled out for E.

Positions:
1: not E (from feedback)
1: not C, R, A, T
2: not L (from feedback) and not C, R, A, T
3: ? 
4: N (fixed)
5: ? 

E must be in the word, and it can't be in 1,2, or 5. Therefore, it must be in position 3.

So, we can deduce that position 3 is E.

Then, the word is: [1] [2] E N [5]

Now, we know L and I are in the word, but not in position 2 and 3 respectively? Position 3 is E, so I cannot be in position 3.

L is not in position 2.

Also, I is not in position 3.

L could be in position 1 or 5.

I could be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

But we have constraints:

Position 1: cannot be E (deduced), and cannot be C, R, A, T. Also, it might be L or I or other.

Position 2: cannot be L (from feedback), and cannot be C, R, A, T. It could be I or other.

Position 5: cannot be E (from first feedback), and cannot be C, R, A, T. It could be L or I or other.

Also, the word must contain L and I, and we have two positions: 1,2,5 to fill, but with L and I and one more letter? Since we have three known letters: E, L, I, and one unknown.

The word has E, L, I, N, and one more letter? Because we have five positions, and we know four letters: E, L, I, N. So the fifth letter is unknown.

But we know the word has exactly these four, and one more.

The known letters are E, L, I, N. So the fifth letter is additional.

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A, T.

Now, we need to form a word of the form [1] [2] E N [5], with [1] and [2] and [5] being letters that are not C, R, A, T, and must include L and I in positions 1,2, or 5, but with constraints.

Specifically:
- Position 1: can be L? Yes, because L is not forbidden for position 1.
- Position 2: can be I? Yes, because I is not forbidden for position 2? But from feedback, I is not in position 3, but it can be in 2.
- Position 5: can be L or I? Or other.

But we know L and I are in the word, so they must appear in positions 1,2,5.

However, position 1 cannot be E, and E is in position 3.

Also, position 5 cannot be E (from first feedback).

Now, let's list possible words.

The word pattern: [1] [2] E N [5]

With [1] and [2] and [5] being letters not in {C, R, A, T} and must include L and I.

Also, L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback), and I cannot be in position 3.

So for position 2, if we put I, that's allowed because position 3 is E, so I cannot be there.

Position 1: can be L or I or other, but must include L and I.

Position 5: can be L or I or other.

But we have to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

Option 1: Position 1 is L, position 2 is I, position 5 is something.

Word: L I E N [5]

What can [5] be? It must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and the word must exist.

Possible: ""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENS"" -> L I E N S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:E, 4:N, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

And S is not in the absent list (C, R, A, T are absent, S is not mentioned, so S is possible).

Also, ""LIENS"" is a word (plural of lien).

Option 2: Position 1 is I, position 2 is L? But L cannot be in position 2? From ""elint"" feedback, L is not in position 2, so if we put I in position 1 and L in position 2, that would be invalid because L cannot be in position 2.

In ""elint"", we had L in position 2 and got L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. So L cannot be in position 2.

Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

So for position 2, if we put I, that's allowed because position 3 is E, so I is not forced to avoid position 2? Position 2 can be I.

But if we put L in position 1, then position 2 must be something else, and position 5 something.

So:

Case 1: Position 1 = L, position 2 = I, position 5 = X -> word: L I E N X

X must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and ""LIEN"" + X? ""LIENS"" is one.

Other words? ""LIENT"" not a word.

""LIENS"" is one.

Case 2: Position 1 = L, position 2 = X, position 5 = I -> word: L X E N I

But position 5 is I, which is allowed? I is not forbidden for position 5? Only forbidden for position 3.

So ""L X E N I"" -> words like ""LEXIN"" not a word.

""LITEN"" -> L I T E N -> but T is absent (from ""elint"" feedback: T(x)), so cannot use T.

""LIVEN"" -> L I V E N -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:V? But we need E in position 3? ""LIVEN"" is L I V E N -> positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:N -> but we need position 3 to be E, not position 4. So no.

We need position 3 to be E, so for case 2: position 1=L, position 2=X, position 5=I -> word: L X E N I -> but that would be L X E N I, so position 3 is E, position 4=N, position 5=I.

Is there a word like that? ""LUNGI"" not a word.

""LEXIN"" not.

""LEVIN"" -> L E V I N -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:V, 4:I, 5:N -> but position 3 is V, not E. We need position 3 to be E.

So not.

""LIBEL"" -> L I B E L -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:B, 4:E, 5:L -> position 3 is B, not E.

Not matching.

So case 2 doesn't yield a common word.

Case 3: Position 1 = I, position 2 = L, position 5 = X -> word: I L E N X -> ""ILENS"" is not a word, but ""ILEN"" is 4 letters.

""I"" in position 1, ""L"" in position 2, ""E"" in position 3, ""N"" in position 4, and position 5=X.

What words? ""ILIAN"" -> I L I A N -> A absent, and also position 3 is I, not E.

""I L E N X"" -> ""ILENX"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=X, position 5=I -> word: I X E N I -> ""IXENI"" not a word.

Not.

So case 3 doesn't work.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 1: position 1=L, position 2=I, position 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

But ""LIENS"" has S in position 5.

Another possibility: position 1=L, position 2=X, position 5=I -> but we need a word, like ""LUCRE"" but C and R absent, and position 3 is U, not E.

Not.

""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

So ""LIENS"" seems a candidate.

But we have position 5=I? In ""LIENS"", position 5 is S, not I.

In case 1, we have position 1=L, 2=I, 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

Position 5 is S.

But we know E is in position 3, so in ""LIENS"", it's L I E N S -> 1:L, 2:I, 3:E, 4:N, 5:S.

This matches the pattern.

Now, we need to check if it fits all feedback.

First, from ""crane"": 
- We had E in position 5? In ""crane"", E was in position 5, but in the secret word, E is in position 3, so position 5 is S, which is not E, so that's fine.

From ""elint"":
- E in position 1: we got E(-), meaning E is not in position 1, which is consistent because E is in position 3.
- L in position 2: we got L(-), meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In ""LIENS"", L is in position 1, not 2, so that's fine.
- I in position 3: we got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. In ""LIENS"", I is in position 2, not 3, so that's fine.
- N in position 4: correct.
- T: absent, and ""LIENS"" has no T, so T(x) is consistent.

Also, the word ""LIENS"" does not contain C, R, A, T, so it's valid.

But is ""LIENS"" a word? It is the plural of ""lien"", meaning a security device or a bond.

It's acceptable.

Another word? What about ""LIKEN""? Not a common word.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about position 5=I? For example, ""LIENI"" not a word.

""LITIE"" -> L I T I E -> T absent, and position 4 is I? Not N.

Not.

""LIVID"" -> L I V I D -> position 4 is I, not N.

Not.

So ""LIENS"" seems the most likely.

But we have another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could E be in position 3, and another E? But we don't have any indication of duplicate letters so far.

In ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and got dash, meaning E is present but not in 5, but it doesn't say anything about duplicates. Similarly, in ""elint"", E in position 1 got dash, meaning E is present but not in 1. But it could be that E appears twice? However, we have no feedback suggesting duplicates.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in this case, with E in position 3, and position 5 is S, there's no duplicate E issue.

Another word: ""LIKEN"" is not standard.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""LIENS"" for the third guess.

But we are not yet sure.

We have to guess.

Since we have limited tries, and ""LIENS"" fits, we can guess it.

But let's see if there is another word with E in position 3 and N in 4.

For example, ""BLUEN"" not a word.

""FLUEN"" not.

""GLUEN"" not.

""PLUEN"" not.

""SLUEN"" not.

""BEIGE"" -> B E I G E -> 1:B, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:E -> position 3 is I, not E, and E in 5th.

Not.

""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:I, 4:G, 5:N -> position 3 is I, not E.

Not.

So ""LIENS"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure about the position of E.

We deduced that E must be in position 3 because it can't be in 1,2,5, and 4 is N.

Also, in position 3, it can be, and we have no feedback contradicting.

Moreover, in ""elint"", we had I in position 3 and got I(-), meaning I is not in position 3, but that doesn't affect E's position.

So the word should be [1] [2] E N [5]

With [1] and [2] and [5] not in {C, R, A, T}

And L and I must be in [1], [2], or [5], but with constraints:
- L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"" feedback)
- I cannot be in position 3 (from ""elint"" feedback)

In ""LIENS"", L is in position 1, I is in position 2, both within allowed positions.

Also, position 5 is S, which is not forbidden.

Another word: ""LIKEN"" is not standard, but ""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENS"" is the word.

But to be thorough, let's list all possible 5-letter words with pattern [1] [2] E N [5], not containing C, R, A, T.

[1] and [2] and [5] are letters not in {C, R, A, T}

And the word must contain L and I.

Also, L cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 3.

So:

- If [1]=L, [2]=I, [5]=S -> ""LIENS""
- If [1]=L, [2]=X, [5]=I -> what word? For example, ""LUCRE"" has C and R absent. ""LITEN"" has T absent. ""LIVEN"" has V, but position 3 is V, not E. ""LUBEN"" not common. ""LUMEN"" -> L U M E N -> 1:L, 2:U, 3:M, 4:E, 5:N -> position 3 is M, not E. Not.

""LIENS"" is the only common word I can think of.

""LIEN"" is 4 letters.

""LIENF"" not a word.

So ""LIENS"" seems the best.

But we have to consider that I could be in position 1 or 5.

For example, if position 1 = I, position 2 = L, position 5 = X -> word: I L E N X

What words? ""ILEN"" is 4 letters. ""ILENS"" is not a word. ""ILEAC"" not.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=L, position 5=I -> word: I L E N I -> ""ILENI"" not a word. ""ILYEN"" not.

Not.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=L -> word: I L E N L -> ""ILENL"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=X -> word: I X E N X -> ""IXENX"" not a word.

So no common words.

Therefore, the only common word is ""LIENS"".

Moreover, in ""LIENS"", we have:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: S

Now, check against feedback:

From ""crane"": E was in position 5, but in the secret word, position 5 is S, so E is in position 3, which is fine.

From ""elint"": 
- E in position 1: secret has E in position 3, so E is present but not in 1 (dash), correct.
- L in position 2: secret has L in position 1, so L is present but not in 2 (dash), correct.
- I in position 3: secret has I in position 2, so I is present but not in 3 (dash), correct.
- N in position 4: correct.
- T: absent, and ""LIENS"" has no T, correct.

Also, the word does not contain C, R, A, T, which is good.

So ""LIENS"" should be the guess.

But let's see if there is another possibility.

What if the word has L in position 5? For example, position 1=?, position 2=?, position 3=E, position 4=N, position 5=L.

Then the word is ? ? E N L

And I must be in position 1 or 2.

For example, position 1=I, position 2=? , position 5=L -> word: I ? E N L

What can be in position 2? It must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T}, and the word must contain I.

Possible: ""I"" in position 2, then position 5=L, so ""I L E N L"" -> ""ILENL"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 2=X, position 5=L -> ""I X E N L"" -> ""IXEL L"" not a word.

""I"" in position 1, position 5=X -> ""I X E N X"" not a word.

So no common words.

Similarly, position 1=?, position 2=I, position 5=L -> "" ? I E N L"" -> ""X I E N L"" -> ""X"" must be a letter, e.g., ""MIENL"" not a word.

So only ""LIENS"" works.

Therefore, we guess ""LIENS"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

In ""elint"", we had I in position 3 and got I(-), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. In ""LIENS"", I is in position 2, so that's fine.

Similarly, L is in position 1, not 2, fine.

E is in position 3, not 1 or 2 or 5, so must be 3, fine.

N in 4, fine.

So ""LIENS"" should be the guess.

But we have to make sure about the position of E. We deduced it must be in position 3.

Is it possible that E is in position 3 and we are correct.

To be thorough, let's see if there is any other word that fits the pattern and the constraints.

Suppose position 1=L, position 2=I, position 5=S -> ""LIENS"".

Position 1=I, position 2=L, position 5=S -> ""ILiens"" not a word, but ""ILIEN"" is 5 letters? ""ILIEN"" is not standard.

""ILIAD"" has A and not N.

So I think ""LIENS"" is the word.

Therefore, we guess ""LIENS"".

But in the feedback, we have E not in 1 or 2 or 5, so position 3 is the only option.

So the guess is ""LIENS"".

But let's write it.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-)  
  - N is in the 4th position (correct).  
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - C, R, A are absent.  

- **Guess 2: elint** → Feedback: E(-), L(-), I(-), N(✓), T(x)  
  - E is in the word but not in the 1st position (and not in 2nd or 5th, from prior feedback; thus E must be in the 3rd position).  
  - L is in the word but not in the 2nd position.  
  - I is in the word but not in the 3rd position.  
  - N remains correct in the 4th position.  
  - T is absent.  

### Deductions:
- **Fixed position**: Position 4 is N (from both guesses).  
- **E's position**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from feedback). Since position 4 is N, E must be in position 3.  
- **L and I**: Both are in the word but not in the positions guessed:  
  - L cannot be in position 2 (from ""elint"").  
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from ""elint"").  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T are not in the word.  
- **Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `[1] [2] E N [5]`, where:  
  - `[1]` and `[2]` cannot be L or I if they are to be placed there later.  
  - `[5]` cannot be E (from ""crane"").  
- **Constraints for L and I**:  
  - L must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).  
  - I must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (position 3 is invalid).  

### Solving for the word:
- The only common English word fitting `[1] [2] E N [5]` is **""LIENS""** (plural of ""lien""), where:  
  - `[1] = L` (testing L in position 1).  
  - `[2] = I` (testing I in position 2).  
  - `[3] = E` (confirmed position).  
  - `[4] = N` (confirmed).  
  - `[5] = S` (testing S in position 5).  
- This word satisfies all feedback:  
  - E is in position 3 (not 1, 2, or 5).  
  - L is present but not in position 2.  
  - I is present but not in position 3.  
  - No C, R, A, or T.  
- If correct, this guess could win.",Guess 4: liens -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
