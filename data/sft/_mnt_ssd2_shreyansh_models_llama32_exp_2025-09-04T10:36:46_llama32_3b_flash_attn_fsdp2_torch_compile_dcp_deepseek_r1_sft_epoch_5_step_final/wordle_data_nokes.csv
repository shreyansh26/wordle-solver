 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 2 known letters (N and E) but we don't know their positions.

 We can try to place N and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That's correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.

 However, we must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it's okay.

 But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn't mean we can't put N in position 3? Actually, we can.

 However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.

 Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.

 Some words: 
 - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

 However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N's, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one '-' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N's, then both would be marked accordingly.

 Since we don't have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.

 Now, let's consider ""SINEW"": 
   S (new), I (new), N (we know it's present, but in position 3?), E (we know it's present, in position 4?), W (new).

 But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.

 However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that information for N and E yet.

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

 How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can't move it because it's fixed.

 Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

 We must avoid A.

 Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> 
   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that's okay.

 However, we are not sure about the positions.

 But we also have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""MELON"" doesn't have them.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:

 - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.

<guess>onset</guess>",onset,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Some words:

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.",Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 2 known letters (N and E) but we don't know their positions.

 We can try to place N and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That's correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.

 However, we must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it's okay.

 But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn't mean we can't put N in position 3? Actually, we can.

 However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.

 Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.

 Some words: 
 - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

 However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N's, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one '-' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N's, then both would be marked accordingly.

 Since we don't have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.

 Now, let's consider ""SINEW"": 
   S (new), I (new), N (we know it's present, but in position 3?), E (we know it's present, in position 4?), W (new).

 But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.

 However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that information for N and E yet.

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

 How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can't move it because it's fixed.

 Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

 We must avoid A.

 Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> 
   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that's okay.

 However, we are not sure about the positions.

 But we also have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""MELON"" doesn't have them.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:

 - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.

Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.\n\n But wait: what if the word has two N\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it\'s possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\n However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N\'s, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N\'s, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one \'-\' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N\'s, then both would be marked accordingly.\n\n Since we don\'t have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.\n\n Now, let\'s consider ""SINEW"": \n   S (new), I (new), N (we know it\'s present, but in position 3?), E (we know it\'s present, in position 4?), W (new).\n\n But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.\n\n However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have that information for N and E yet.\n\n Another candidate: ""STONE"": \n   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t use that.\n\n How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can\'t move it because it\'s fixed.\n\n Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).\n\n We must avoid A.\n\n Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> \n   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that\'s okay.\n\n However, we are not sure about the positions.\n\n But we also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n ""MELON"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.\n\n Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:\n\n - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> \n   This has two N\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don\'t know about position 3 and 5.\n\n   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.\n\n We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.\n\n Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it\'s not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.\n\n We can try:\n\n Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? \n   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E\'s? and D and S. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E\'s and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.\n\n Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> \n      I: new, N: we know it\'s present, L: new, E: we know it\'s present, T: new.\n\n This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", \n   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? \n\n But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> \n   N is in position 2, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:\n   O: new\n   N: in position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before)\n   S: new\n   E: in position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E before)\n   T: new\n\n This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).\n\n Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.\n\n Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.\n\n So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\n However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> \n   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? \n\n This also avoids C, R, A.\n\n But we are putting E in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s correct. And N in position 5? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing new positions.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don\'t have a correct position for N and E yet.\n\n I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.\n\n Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   In ""ONSET"": \n      Position 1: O (new)\n      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)\n      Position 3: S (new)\n      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)\n      Position 5: T (new)\n\n This is a valid word.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""ONSET"".\n\n But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that\'s okay.\n\n Let me write the guess: ONSET.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that\'s fine.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that\'s fine.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).\n3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).\n4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.\n\nThe word **ONSET** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).\n- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).\n\nThis tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""onset""
- O: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: - (in word, wrong position)
- S: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- T: x (not in word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word contains: N, E, O, S (since they are marked as present in some way). Note:
   - E is correct in position 4 (from ""onset"").
   - O is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""crane"") and not in position 2 (from ""onset"").
   - S is in the word but not in position 3.

2. The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, T (from the x's).

3. E is fixed in position 4.

So, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _

We know the word has O, N, S, and E. Since E is in position 4, the other three letters are O, N, S, and one more letter that we haven't discovered yet.

We also know the positions:
- O is not in position 1.
- N is not in position 2, 3, or 4.
- S is not in position 3.

Given that E is in position 4, and the word has 5 letters, we can list possible positions for O, N, S:

Possible positions:
- O: can be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).
- N: can be in position 1, 5 (since not 2,3,4).
- S: can be in position 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not 3).

We need to find a word that fits: _ _ _ E _ , with the letters O, N, S, and one unknown letter (let's call it X), and satisfying the position constraints.

We also know that the word does not contain C, R, A, T.

We must choose a word that uses only these letters (O, N, S, E, and X) and places them appropriately.

We have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

We need to test the positions for O, N, S and find the unknown letter X.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain O, N, S.

Since E is fixed at position 4, the word is ? ? ? E ?

We know O, N, S must be in the first three positions, but with constraints.

Possible arrangements:

Option 1: N in position 1, then O and S in positions 2,3,5 but with S not in 3 and O not in 1.

But if N is in position 1, then:
- O can be in 2,3,5
- S can be in 2,4,5 (since not 3)

But position 5: if O is there, that's okay? But we have to assign.

Let me try to form words:

We need a word: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E [letter5]

With letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 being O, N, S, and one more (X), but note that we have four letters and one unknown.

Actually, we have five positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know position 4 is E.

So we have positions 1,2,3,5 to fill with O, N, S, and X.

But note: O, N, S must be among these, and X is the fifth.

We also know that O cannot be in 1, N cannot be in 2,3,4, and S cannot be in 3.

So for position 1: can be O? No, because O is not in position 1 (from ""onset"" feedback). So position 1 must be either N or X.

Similarly, position 2: can be O, S, or X? But N cannot be in 2, so position 2 can be O, S, or X.

Position 3: can be O or X (since N and S cannot be in 3? Wait: S cannot be in 3, but N can be in 3? Let me clarify:

Constraints:
- O: not in 1 -> can be in 2,3,5
- N: not in 2,3,4 -> can be in 1,5
- S: not in 3 -> can be in 1,2,4,5

So possible combinations:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then position 1: N
Position 2: can be O, S, or X
Position 3: can be O or X (since S cannot be in 3, and N is already in 1)
Position 5: can be S or X (since O can be in 5)

But we have to assign O, S, and X to positions 2,3,5 without conflict.

For example:
- If position 2 is O, then position 3 can be X (if X is not S) or position 5 can be S.
- If position 2 is S, then position 3 can be O or X, and position 5 can be O or X.

Case 2: N in position 5.
Then position 5: N
Position 1: can be O or X (since N is taken)
Position 2: can be O, S, or X
Position 3: can be O or X (since S cannot be in 3)

But we also have to include S. So if N is at the end, S must be in one of 1,2,4.

Let me try to find actual words.

We also know that the word must be valid and avoid C, R, A, T.

We can try to use a word that tests these possibilities.

But note: we have only one unknown letter. So we can try to guess a word that uses O, N, S, E, and one new letter for the unknown position.

We want to maximize information. Since we know four letters (O,N,S,E) and one is missing, we can try to include common letters for X.

But we don't know what X is. It could be any letter except C,R,A,T.

Common letters: we can try B, D, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, etc.

We also have to consider the positions.

Let me list possible words:

- If N is in position 1 and O in position 2: then word starts with ""NO"" and then E at the end? So ""NO??E"". But we need a word. ""NOISE"" -> but I is a common letter. But let's check: 
  ""NOISE"": N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but wait, E is in position 5? But we know E is fixed in position 4. So that doesn't work.

We need E in position 4, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ E _

So for ""NO"" at the beginning: it would be ""NO? ? E"" -> but the fifth letter is missing.

Words starting with ""NO"" and ending with E: not common? Actually, ""NOISE"" has E at the end, but that's position 5, not 4. We need position 4 to be E.

So the pattern is: letter1, letter2, letter3, E, letter5.

With letter1, letter2, letter3, letter5 being O, N, S, and one more.

Let me think of words ending with ""E"" and having O, N, S.

Examples:
- ""SONES"": but that has two S's? And O in position 3? But ""SONES"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let's see: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). But we have two S's? And we don't know if S is duplicated? But in the feedback, we only have one S marked? In ""onset"", S was in position 3 and marked as present but wrong position. It doesn't say anything about duplicates. So the word might have two S's? But we don't know.

But note: in ""onset"", we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it could be more.

Similarly, for ""SONES"": it has S at positions 1 and 5. But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But let's check the constraints for ""SONES"":
- S in position 1: allowed? S can be in 1,2,4,5. Position 1 is allowed.
- O in position 2: allowed? O can be in 2,3,5. Position 2 is allowed.
- N in position 3: but wait, N cannot be in position 3? We know N is not in position 3? From ""onset"", we had N in position 2 and it was wrong, and in ""crane"" N in position 4 was wrong. But position 3 for N? We haven't tried that. However, we know N is not in 2,3,4. So position 3 is allowed for N? Yes, because we haven't tested N in position 3.

But in ""onset"", we had N in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't say anything about position 3. Similarly, in ""crane"", N was in position 4 and wrong, but position 3 was not tested.

So N can be in position 3.

Similarly, S can be in position 1.

But ""SONES"" has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3.

But we also have O in position 2.

But is ""SONES"" a valid word? It might be considered plural of sonus? But let's avoid if not common.

Another word: ""SONIC"" -> but C is not allowed (we know C is absent).

Avoid C.

Another: ""SONES"" might not be ideal. Let's think of other words.

What about ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 2 and 5? But we know E is in position 4. Also, we have two S's and two E's? But we know E is only in position 4? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate E. But in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now in ""onset"", E was correct in position 4. So if there is another E, we don't know.

But in ""SENSE"", we have E in position 2 and 5. But we know E is in position 4, so position 2 and 5 would be extra.

But let's see the constraints for ""SENSE"":
- S in position 1: allowed.
- E in position 2: but we know E is in position 4, but it could be elsewhere? The feedback only said E is in the word and not in position 5 (from ""crane"") and now not in position 4 (if it were there, it would have been marked as correct in ""onset""? But in ""onset"", E was in position 4 and marked correct, so E is only in position 4? Actually, the feedback for ""onset"" showed E as correct, so position 4 is E. Therefore, E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Because if it were, we would have seen an extra mark? Not necessarily: if there is only one E, and it is fixed at 4, then E cannot be in 2 or 5. But if there are two E's, then it could be in 2 or 5? However, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked as present but wrong position. That means that E is in the word but not in position 5. Then in ""onset"", E in position 4 is correct. So if there is an extra E, it could be in position 2 or 5? But the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the E in position 5 as present (but wrong position) only if there is an E elsewhere? Actually, the feedback marks each occurrence. If there is only one E, then it cannot be in position 5 (from ""crane"") and cannot be in position 4 (from ""onset""). So if we put E in position 2 or 5, it would be incorrect because those positions are forbidden for E? Actually, no: the feedback only marks a letter as present if it exists. If there is only one E, then position 2 and 5 are not E because they would have been marked as correct or present? But in ""crane"", position 5 E was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. Then in ""onset"", position 4 E is correct. So if there is only one E, then position 2 and 5 cannot be E. But if there are two E's, then position 2 or 5 could be E? However, the feedback for ""crane"" would have marked the E in position 5 as present (if there is an E in position 2 or 5) but we didn't get a mark for E in position 5? Actually, we did: the E in position 5 was marked as present but wrong position. That means that E is in the word, but not at position 5. So if there is an extra E, it could be in position 2 or 5? But we don't have feedback about position 2 because we didn't guess E there.

But in ""onset"", we didn't guess E in position 2. We guessed O in position 1, N in 2, etc.

So we cannot rule out E in position 2 or 5? But we know that position 5 E is forbidden? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" said E is not in position 5. Then in ""onset"", E is in position 4 and correct. So if there is an extra E, it must be in position 2 or 5? But position 5 is forbidden for E? So it must be in position 2? But we don't have feedback that E is in position 2.

Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. For E, we know:
- Not in position 5 (from ""crane"")
- Not in position 4 (from ""onset"" would have shown if it were there, but it didn't because we have a correct mark). So E is fixed at position 4. Therefore, E cannot be in position 2 or 5? Because if it were, we would have gotten a mark for it? Actually, no: if E were in position 2, and we didn't guess it, we wouldn't know. But in ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means E is in the word but not in position 5. Then in ""onset"", we have E in position 4 and it is correct. So if there is an extra E, it must be in position 2? But we haven't guessed E in position 2. Similarly, position 5: we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess.

So we can assume that E is only in position 4, and not elsewhere? But we don't have proof. However, to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we see evidence.

But in our next guess, we can try to test.

However, we have to form a valid word.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

We need a word: [1] [2] [3] E [5]

With [1], [2], [3], [5] being letters from {O, N, S} and one more (X), and avoiding C,R,A,T.

Also, the letters must be distinct? Not necessarily, but we don't know.

Now, let's consider the constraints on positions:

- O: not in 1 -> so O must be in 2,3, or 5.
- N: not in 2,3,4 -> so N must be in 1 or 5.
- S: not in 3 -> so S must be in 1,2,4,5.

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then:
- Position 1: N
- Position 4: E
- Then positions 2,3,5: O, S, X (in some order, but S cannot be in 3, so S must be in 2 or 5, and O and X in the remaining).

If N is in 1, then:
- Position 2: can be O or S or X.
- Position 3: can be O or X (since S cannot be in 3).
- Position 5: can be S or X (since O can be in 5? But O can be in 5).

But S cannot be in 3, so if position 3 is O, then S must be in 2 or 5, and X in the remaining.

If position 2 is S, then:
- Position 2: S
- Then position 3: can be O or X.
- Position 5: can be O or X.

But O can be in 5? Yes.

Example: if we have ""N O S E ?"" -> but we need a word. ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4. So we need 5 letters.

Words: 
- ""NOSE"" is 4, so add a letter? ""NOSED"" -> but D is a common letter. ""NOSED"" has two E's? ""NOSED"" is N,O,S,E,D -> but that would be positions: N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). But S is in position 3? But S cannot be in position 3! Because in ""onset"", S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S is not in 3. Therefore, we cannot put S in position 3.

So in the case above, if we put S in position 2, then position 3 must be O or X, and position 5 must be O or X.

But if we put O in position 3, then position 2 must be S (since N is in 1, and we have to place O,S,X). Then position 5 can be X.

So one candidate: ""N S O E X"" -> but that's ""NSOEX""? Not a word.

Another: ""N O X E S"" -> ""NOXES""? Not common.

""NOXES"" is not standard. Let me think of common words.

What about ""NOISE""? But ""NOISE"" has E at the end? No, ""NOISE"" is N-O-I-S-E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5). But we need E in position 4, not 5. So that doesn't work.

We need E in position 4, so the last letter is something else.

So pattern: _ _ _ E _

With N in 1, O, S, X in 2,3,5 but with constraints.

For example: 
- Position 2: S (allowed, since S not in 3)
- Position 3: O (allowed, since O not in 1, and we are putting it in 3)
- Position 5: X (can be, since S cannot be in 3, but X is fine)

So ""N S O E X"" -> ""NSOEX"" is not a word.

Another: ""N O X E S"" -> ""NOXES"" is not common. ""NOX"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""NOSED"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). But S is in position 3? Not allowed! S cannot be in position 3.

So we cannot have S in position 3.

Therefore, in this case, if N is in 1, then S cannot be in 3. So S must be in 2 or 5.

If S is in 2, then position 3 must be O or X.

If S is in 5, then position 3 must be O or X, and position 2 must be O or X (since S is in 5).

But O can be in 2 or 5? Yes.

So let's try S in position 2.

Then word: N O ? E S -> but we need a letter for position 3. And position 5 is S.

So ""N O X E S"" -> ""NOXES"" is not a word.

""N O S E D"" -> ""NOSED"" is not a word.

""N O S E R"" -> but R is not allowed.

""N O S E S"" -> duplicate S? And not a word.

This is difficult.

Now, case 2: N in position 5.

Then position 5: N

Position 1: can be O or X (since N is at the end)
Position 2: can be O, S, or X
Position 3: can be O or X (since S cannot be in 3)

So subcases:

Subcase 2.1: Position 1 is O.
Then word: O ? ? E N

Position 2: can be S or X
Position 3: can be S or X (since O is in 1, and S cannot be in 3)

If position 2 is S, then position 3 can be X (since S is in 2, and S cannot be in 3, so position 3 must be X)
Then word: O S X E N -> ""OS X E N"" -> e.g., ""OSIER"" but R is not allowed. ""OSED""? Not a word.

""OSCAR"" -> but C and R not allowed.

""OSPRE"" -> R not allowed.

Not working.

If position 2 is X (where X is a new letter), then position 3 can be S (allowed? S can be in 3? Wait, no: S cannot be in position 3. So position 3 must be S? But S cannot be in 3? Yes, from ""onset"" feedback: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S is not in 3. Therefore, position 3 must be X, not S.

So if position 1 is O, position 2 is X, position 3 must be X? But we have two X's? No, we have O in 1, X in 2, X in 3? But we have to place S somewhere. S can be in 4 or 5? But position 5 is N, so S must be in 4? Then position 3 must be X? But we have to put S in 4? Then position 3 must be X? But we have to put S in 4? But position 4 is E, so S cannot be in 4? Because position 4 is E. So S must be in 5? Then position 3 must be X.

So word: O X X E N -> but then we have two X's? And S in 5. But we need to fill position 3 with X. Then the word would be ""OXE N"" -> but that's not a word.

""OXEN"" is 4 letters.

""OXE"" is not 5.

This is not working.

Subcase 2.2: Position 1 is not O, so position 1 is X (unknown letter).

Then word: X ? ? E N

Position 2: can be O or S (since X is in 1)
Position 3: can be O or X (but S cannot be in 3, so position 3 must be X)

So word: X O X E N -> ""X O X E N"" -> not a word.

X O S E N -> ""XOSEN"" not a word.

X S E E N -> duplicate E? And not a word.

This is difficult.

Subcase 2.3: Position 1 is S? But S cannot be in position 1? No, from ""onset"" feedback, O was in position 1 and marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in 1? Actually, the feedback for O was that it is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't say anything about S in position 1. But we know S is in the word and not in position 3. So S can be in 1? Yes, but we haven't tested it.

But if S is in position 1, then word: S ? ? E N

Position 2: can be O or X
Position 3: can be O or X (since S is in 1, and S cannot be in 3, so position 3 must be X)

Then word: S X X E N -> ""S X X E N"" -> e.g., ""SIXEN"" not a word.

""SAVEN"" -> A not allowed.

""SHOEN"": S(1), H(2), O(3), E(4), N(5). But O is in position 3? And we know O is in the word, but we don't have constraint on position 3 for O? Only that O cannot be in position 1.

In ""SHOEN"": 
- S in position 1: allowed? S can be in 1,2,4,5. Position 1 is allowed.
- H: new letter
- O in position 3: allowed? O can be in 2,3,5. Position 3 is allowed.
- E in position 4: correct.
- N in position 5: allowed? N can be in 1 or 5. Position 5 is allowed.

But we have to check if H is allowed? We don't know if H is in the word? We are testing.

But ""SHOEN"" is a valid word (meaning: shoen is not common; the plural is shoes, but ""shoen"" might be accepted? Actually, ""shoed"" is a word, but we need 5 letters. ""SHOEN"" is not standard. Let me think of common words.

""SHONE"": past tense of shine? But ""SHONE"" is S-H-O-N-E -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we need E in position 4? In ""SHONE"", E is in position 5? Not matching.

We need E in position 4.

So the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the last letter is not E? The word has E in position 4, so the fifth letter is something else.

For example, ""SHORE"" -> but R is not allowed.

""SOLE"" is 4 letters.

""SOLES"": S(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). But S is in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. But we have E in position 4.

But S is in position 1 and 5? And we don't know if S is duplicated.

But in ""SOLES"", we have two S's. And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But let's see the constraints:
- O in position 2: allowed? O can be in 2,3,5. Position 2 is allowed.
- S in position 1: allowed? S can be in 1,2,4,5. Position 1 is allowed.
- S in position 5: allowed? Yes.
- E in position 4: correct.

But position 3: L. Is L allowed? We don't know.

But ""SOLES"" has two S's. We can try.

But we also have to consider: in ""onset"", we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""SOLES"", then S is in position 1 and 5. When we guessed ""onset"" with S in position 3, it was marked as present (which it is, because there is an S in the word) but not in position 3. So that's consistent.

But we have an extra S? And we don't know if that's allowed.

But we are trying to guess.

Another word: ""SONES"" as before, but it's not common.

Perhaps ""SNOZE"": S(1), N(2), O(3), Z(4), E(5) -> but E is in position 5, not 4. We need E in 4.

""SONES"" is not standard.

Let me think of words ending with ""EN"" after E? So the pattern is ? ? ? E N.

But we have position 4 as E, so the last letter is N? Then the word ends with ""EN"".

Words ending with ""EN"": e.g., ""SHEN"": 4 letters. ""SHINE"": S-H-I-N-E -> but that's S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5). But we need E in position 4, so not.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word must be ? ? ? E N? That would be 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 with 4=E and 5=N.

But in our pattern, position 4 is E, position 5 is N? But in the word, position 5 is N, position 4 is E. So the word ends with ""EN"".

But in our pattern, position 4 is E, so the last two letters are E and then N? So the word ends with ""EN"".

But in the pattern, position 4 is E, position 5 is N? Then the word ends with ""EN"". But we have position 4 E and position 5 N? Then the word is ? ? ? E N.

For example, ""SHIRE"" -> but R not allowed.

""PHONE"": P-H-O-N-E -> but that's P(1), H(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But we need E in position 4? Here E is in 5. Not matching.

We need the fourth letter to be E, so the word must be ...E? and then N at the end? So the last two are E and then N? So the word ends with ""EN"".

But in our pattern, position 4 is E, so the word is ...E?, then ?N.

But in the word, position 5 is N, position 4 is E. So the last two letters are E and then N? So the word ends with ""EN"".

But in our pattern, position 4 is E, so the word is ...E? and then N at the end? So the word ends with ""EN"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 2 known letters (N and E) but we don't know their positions.

 We can try to place N and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That's correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.

 However, we must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it's okay.

 But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn't mean we can't put N in position 3? Actually, we can.

 However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.

 Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.

 Some words: 
 - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

 However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N's, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one '-' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N's, then both would be marked accordingly.

 Since we don't have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.

 Now, let's consider ""SINEW"": 
   S (new), I (new), N (we know it's present, but in position 3?), E (we know it's present, in position 4?), W (new).

 But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.

 However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that information for N and E yet.

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

 How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can't move it because it's fixed.

 Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

 We must avoid A.

 Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> 
   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that's okay.

 However, we are not sure about the positions.

 But we also have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""MELON"" doesn't have them.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:

 - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.

But wait: in ""INLET"", \n   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? \n\n But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> \n   N is in position 2, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:\n   O: new\n   N: in position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before)\n   S: new\n   E: in position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E before)\n   T: new\n\n This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).\n\n Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.\n\n Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.\n\n So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\n However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> \n   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? \n\n This also avoids C, R, A.\n\n But we are putting E in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s correct. And N in position 5? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing new positions.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don\'t have a correct position for N and E yet.\n\n I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.\n\n Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   In ""ONSET"": \n      Position 1: O (new)\n      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)\n      Position 3: S (new)\n      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)\n      Position 5: T (new)\n\n This is a valid word.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""ONSET"".\n\n But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that\'s okay.\n\n Let me write the guess: ONSET.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that\'s fine.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that\'s fine.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).\n3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).\n4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.\n\nThe word **ONSET** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).\n- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).\n\nThis tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).

Present letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).
- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).

Absent letters:
- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)
- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, let's list what we know:

Position 4 is E.

The word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don't know yet).

Since N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

S is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: ?

And the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don't know).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.

We need to find a word that fits:

- Has E in position 4.
- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).
- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.

We also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:

- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.
- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.
- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.

Similarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.

If N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.

We know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn't show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.

So, let's assume no duplicates for now.

We have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).

We also have position constraints:

- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5
- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5
- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We can try to form words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word: N _ _ E _
O can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can't be in 2, etc.).

Possible words:
- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.

But we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.

We need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?

With O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.

Example: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Possible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: N ? ? E ?

Let me think of words: 
- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N's? And E in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). 
  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). 
  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.

We must have S in the word.

So: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.

How about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.

""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.
  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.

""Noses""? But that's 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S's? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S's, that's possible? But we don't know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.

But R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But we are trying to guess, so let's consider.

However, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.

Another word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? 
  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?

With N, O, S, and one more letter.

Let me list possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters with E in the fourth.

Examples:
- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N's and no S. So no.
- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's not a problem. 
  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. 
  But we don't have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.

But wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.

So ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.

But we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got '-', so it's not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven't tried that).

But we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").

In ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.

But we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat letters and uses a new letter.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).

Let me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""SONES"" as above.
- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.
- ""SONLY""? Not a word.
- ""SONES"" is a word.

Another: ""NOISE"" doesn't have E in position 4.

What about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? 
  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

""HOSE"" is 4 letters.

""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.

""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.

What about ""NOSED""? But that's 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.
  This fits: E in position 4.

But is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. 

""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let's look for better.

""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? 
  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). 
  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.

We need to avoid S in position 3.

So let's try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Case: S in position 1.
Then: S ? ? E ?
And O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.

Example: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.

""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.

""S O F T E""? But T is absent.

""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: S ? ? E ?

Possible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.

If N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?

Example: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S's? And O in position 2? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's fine. 
  But we have two S's? The word ""SONES"" is valid.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. We can try it.

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E.

Another idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.

Word: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.

Example: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.

""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).

""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.

We need to use a new letter in position 3.

How about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.

We need E in position 4.

Another: ""NOSED"" is not standard.

""POSED"" has S in position 3.

Let me try S in position 2.

Case: S in position 2.
Then: ? S ? E ?

And O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).

Example: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.

""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? 
  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 2 and 5. 
  And O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.

So we cannot skip O.

We must have all of N, O, S, E.

So if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?

We need O and N in the remaining positions.

Example: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).

So O cannot be in position 1.

Therefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.

And N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).

So possibilities:
- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? 
  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).

If N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? 
  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.

""NSOE"" is not a word.

If N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.
  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.

""USONE""? Not a word.

This is difficult.

Case: S in position 5.
Then: ? ? ? E S

O must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).

If O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S
N can be in 1 or 3.

Example: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). 
  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This fits: 
    - E in position 4: good.
    - N in position 1: we haven't tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.
    - O in position 2: we haven't tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.
    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.

  And L is a new letter.

  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.

  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.

But note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:

- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
- L: new letter, position 3.
- E: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)

This seems good.

But is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.

Another possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S
O must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.

If O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.
  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! 
    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This also fits the constraints:
    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)
  And B is new.

But note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven't tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.

Similarly, S in position 5 is new.

So ""BONES"" is a candidate.

But we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".

We also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).

In ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.

We can choose one.

But we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.

In ""BONES"": 
  O is in position 2? We haven't tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don't have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don't test O there. But we haven't tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.

In ""NOLES"":
  O is in position 2? Same as above.

But in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.

We also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it's B, in ""NOLES"" it's L.

Both are common letters.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don't know about B or L.

Another candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? 

Word: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.

""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.

""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.

""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.

So ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.

We can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?
  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). 
  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). 
  This also fits: 
    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.
  And D is new.

  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: 
1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)

We can choose one that tests new positions.

But note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tested.

In ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.

We know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.

But we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.

Similarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are also testing D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.

But let's see.

If we put O in position 3: 
  Then the word: ? ? O E ?

And we need to place N and S.

For example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).

If N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N's? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.

If N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.

Example: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.

""US O E N"" not.

This is hard.

Put O in position 5: 
  Then: ? ? ? E O

And we need to place N and S.

N can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).

S can be in 1,2,3.

Example: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.

If N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.

Example: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.

""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.

Not working.

If N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.

Example: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.

""B U N E O"" -> not a word.

So it's difficult to form a word with O in position 5.

Therefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.

Also, it uses D, which is a common letter.

But note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.

Similarly, O in position 2 is good.

We also test D.

So I'll go with ""SONED"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don't know.

We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.

But we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.

"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? 
  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.

""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.

This is challenging.

Another candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.

But in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.

We can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

So I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.

But wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it's not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn't give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.

So it's okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.

Similarly, we are testing position 2 for O.

So I think it's a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in a different position.

We have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.

Similarly, position 1 for N? We haven't tried.

But in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.

We can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N.

In ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: N
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: D

So we are testing N in position 3.

In ""NOLES"": 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

So we are testing S in position 5.

We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.

I think both test new positions.

But we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.

In ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.

In ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.

But ""BONES"" has O in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.

So let's choose ""SONED"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E is in position 4.
- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).

We are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.
- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.
- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.
- E in position 4: we know it's correct, so ✓.
- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.

This will give us more information.

So, I'll go with ""SONED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed in position 4**.
- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.
- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.
- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).
  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).
  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).
  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).
  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.

<guess>soned</guess>",soned,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).

Present letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).
- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).

Absent letters:
- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)
- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, let's list what we know:

Position 4 is E.

The word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don't know yet).

Since N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

S is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: ?

And the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don't know).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.

We need to find a word that fits:

- Has E in position 4.
- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).
- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.

We also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:

- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.
- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.
- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.

Similarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.

If N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.

We know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn't show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.

So, let's assume no duplicates for now.

We have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).

We also have position constraints:

- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5
- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5
- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We can try to form words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word: N _ _ E _
O can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can't be in 2, etc.).

Possible words:
- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.

But we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.

We need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?

With O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.

Example: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Possible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: N ? ? E ?

Let me think of words: 
- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N's? And E in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). 
  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). 
  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.

We must have S in the word.

So: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.

How about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.

""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.
  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.

""Noses""? But that's 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S's? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S's, that's possible? But we don't know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.

But R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But we are trying to guess, so let's consider.

However, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.

Another word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? 
  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?

With N, O, S, and one more letter.

Let me list possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters with E in the fourth.

Examples:
- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N's and no S. So no.
- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's not a problem. 
  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. 
  But we don't have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.

But wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.

So ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.

But we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got '-', so it's not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven't tried that).

But we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").

In ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.

But we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat letters and uses a new letter.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).

Let me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""SONES"" as above.
- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.
- ""SONLY""? Not a word.
- ""SONES"" is a word.

Another: ""NOISE"" doesn't have E in position 4.

What about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? 
  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

""HOSE"" is 4 letters.

""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.

""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.

What about ""NOSED""? But that's 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.
  This fits: E in position 4.

But is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. 

""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let's look for better.

""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? 
  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). 
  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.

We need to avoid S in position 3.

So let's try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Case: S in position 1.
Then: S ? ? E ?
And O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.

Example: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.

""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.

""S O F T E""? But T is absent.

""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: S ? ? E ?

Possible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.

If N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?

Example: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S's? And O in position 2? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's fine. 
  But we have two S's? The word ""SONES"" is valid.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. We can try it.

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E.

Another idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.

Word: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.

Example: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.

""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).

""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.

We need to use a new letter in position 3.

How about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.

We need E in position 4.

Another: ""NOSED"" is not standard.

""POSED"" has S in position 3.

Let me try S in position 2.

Case: S in position 2.
Then: ? S ? E ?

And O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).

Example: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.

""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? 
  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 2 and 5. 
  And O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.

So we cannot skip O.

We must have all of N, O, S, E.

So if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?

We need O and N in the remaining positions.

Example: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).

So O cannot be in position 1.

Therefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.

And N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).

So possibilities:
- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? 
  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).

If N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? 
  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.

""NSOE"" is not a word.

If N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.
  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.

""USONE""? Not a word.

This is difficult.

Case: S in position 5.
Then: ? ? ? E S

O must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).

If O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S
N can be in 1 or 3.

Example: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). 
  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This fits: 
    - E in position 4: good.
    - N in position 1: we haven't tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.
    - O in position 2: we haven't tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.
    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.

  And L is a new letter.

  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.

  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.

But note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:

- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
- L: new letter, position 3.
- E: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)

This seems good.

But is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.

Another possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S
O must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.

If O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.
  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! 
    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This also fits the constraints:
    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)
  And B is new.

But note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven't tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.

Similarly, S in position 5 is new.

So ""BONES"" is a candidate.

But we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".

We also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).

In ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.

We can choose one.

But we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.

In ""BONES"": 
  O is in position 2? We haven't tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don't have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don't test O there. But we haven't tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.

In ""NOLES"":
  O is in position 2? Same as above.

But in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.

We also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it's B, in ""NOLES"" it's L.

Both are common letters.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don't know about B or L.

Another candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? 

Word: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.

""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.

""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.

""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.

So ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.

We can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?
  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). 
  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). 
  This also fits: 
    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.
  And D is new.

  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: 
1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)

We can choose one that tests new positions.

But note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tested.

In ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.

We know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.

But we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.

Similarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are also testing D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.

But let's see.

If we put O in position 3: 
  Then the word: ? ? O E ?

And we need to place N and S.

For example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).

If N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N's? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.

If N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.

Example: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.

""US O E N"" not.

This is hard.

Put O in position 5: 
  Then: ? ? ? E O

And we need to place N and S.

N can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).

S can be in 1,2,3.

Example: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.

If N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.

Example: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.

""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.

Not working.

If N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.

Example: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.

""B U N E O"" -> not a word.

So it's difficult to form a word with O in position 5.

Therefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.

Also, it uses D, which is a common letter.

But note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.

Similarly, O in position 2 is good.

We also test D.

So I'll go with ""SONED"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don't know.

We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.

But we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.

"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? 
  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.

""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.

This is challenging.

Another candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.

But in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.

We can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

So I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.

But wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it's not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn't give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.

So it's okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.

Similarly, we are testing position 2 for O.

So I think it's a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in a different position.

We have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.

Similarly, position 1 for N? We haven't tried.

But in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.

We can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N.

In ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: N
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: D

So we are testing N in position 3.

In ""NOLES"": 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

So we are testing S in position 5.

We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.

I think both test new positions.

But we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.

In ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.

In ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.

But ""BONES"" has O in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.

So let's choose ""SONED"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E is in position 4.
- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).

We are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.
- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.
- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.
- E in position 4: we know it's correct, so ✓.
- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.

This will give us more information.

So, I'll go with ""SONED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed in position 4**.
- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.
- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.
- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).
  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).
  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).
  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).
  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.",Guess 4: soned -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 2 known letters (N and E) but we don't know their positions.

 We can try to place N and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That's correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.

 However, we must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it's okay.

 But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn't mean we can't put N in position 3? Actually, we can.

 However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.

 Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.

 Some words: 
 - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

 However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N's, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one '-' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N's, then both would be marked accordingly.

 Since we don't have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.

 Now, let's consider ""SINEW"": 
   S (new), I (new), N (we know it's present, but in position 3?), E (we know it's present, in position 4?), W (new).

 But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.

 However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that information for N and E yet.

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

 How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can't move it because it's fixed.

 Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

 We must avoid A.

 Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> 
   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that's okay.

 However, we are not sure about the positions.

 But we also have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""MELON"" doesn't have them.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:

 - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).

Present letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).
- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).

Absent letters:
- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)
- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, let's list what we know:

Position 4 is E.

The word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don't know yet).

Since N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

S is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: ?

And the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don't know).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.

We need to find a word that fits:

- Has E in position 4.
- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).
- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.

We also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:

- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.
- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.
- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.

Similarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.

If N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.

We know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn't show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.

So, let's assume no duplicates for now.

We have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).

We also have position constraints:

- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5
- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5
- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We can try to form words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word: N _ _ E _
O can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can't be in 2, etc.).

Possible words:
- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.

But we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.

We need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?

With O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.

Example: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Possible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: N ? ? E ?

Let me think of words: 
- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N's? And E in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). 
  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). 
  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.

We must have S in the word.

So: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.

How about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.

""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.
  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.

""Noses""? But that's 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S's? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S's, that's possible? But we don't know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.

But R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But we are trying to guess, so let's consider.

However, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.

Another word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? 
  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?

With N, O, S, and one more letter.

Let me list possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters with E in the fourth.

Examples:
- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N's and no S. So no.
- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's not a problem. 
  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. 
  But we don't have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.

But wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.

So ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.

But we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got '-', so it's not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven't tried that).

But we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").

In ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.

But we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat letters and uses a new letter.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).

Let me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""SONES"" as above.
- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.
- ""SONLY""? Not a word.
- ""SONES"" is a word.

Another: ""NOISE"" doesn't have E in position 4.

What about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? 
  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

""HOSE"" is 4 letters.

""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.

""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.

What about ""NOSED""? But that's 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.
  This fits: E in position 4.

But is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. 

""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let's look for better.

""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? 
  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). 
  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.

We need to avoid S in position 3.

So let's try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Case: S in position 1.
Then: S ? ? E ?
And O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.

Example: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.

""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.

""S O F T E""? But T is absent.

""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: S ? ? E ?

Possible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.

If N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?

Example: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S's? And O in position 2? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's fine. 
  But we have two S's? The word ""SONES"" is valid.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. We can try it.

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E.

Another idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.

Word: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.

Example: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.

""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).

""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.

We need to use a new letter in position 3.

How about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.

We need E in position 4.

Another: ""NOSED"" is not standard.

""POSED"" has S in position 3.

Let me try S in position 2.

Case: S in position 2.
Then: ? S ? E ?

And O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).

Example: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.

""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? 
  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 2 and 5. 
  And O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.

So we cannot skip O.

We must have all of N, O, S, E.

So if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?

We need O and N in the remaining positions.

Example: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).

So O cannot be in position 1.

Therefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.

And N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).

So possibilities:
- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? 
  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).

If N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? 
  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.

""NSOE"" is not a word.

If N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.
  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.

""USONE""? Not a word.

This is difficult.

Case: S in position 5.
Then: ? ? ? E S

O must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).

If O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S
N can be in 1 or 3.

Example: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). 
  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This fits: 
    - E in position 4: good.
    - N in position 1: we haven't tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.
    - O in position 2: we haven't tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.
    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.

  And L is a new letter.

  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.

  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.

But note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:

- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
- L: new letter, position 3.
- E: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)

This seems good.

But is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.

Another possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S
O must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.

If O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.
  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! 
    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This also fits the constraints:
    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)
  And B is new.

But note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven't tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.

Similarly, S in position 5 is new.

So ""BONES"" is a candidate.

But we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".

We also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).

In ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.

We can choose one.

But we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.

In ""BONES"": 
  O is in position 2? We haven't tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don't have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don't test O there. But we haven't tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.

In ""NOLES"":
  O is in position 2? Same as above.

But in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.

We also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it's B, in ""NOLES"" it's L.

Both are common letters.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don't know about B or L.

Another candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? 

Word: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.

""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.

""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.

""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.

So ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.

We can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?
  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). 
  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). 
  This also fits: 
    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.
  And D is new.

  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: 
1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)

We can choose one that tests new positions.

But note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tested.

In ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.

We know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.

But we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.

Similarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are also testing D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.

But let's see.

If we put O in position 3: 
  Then the word: ? ? O E ?

And we need to place N and S.

For example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).

If N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N's? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.

If N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.

Example: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.

""US O E N"" not.

This is hard.

Put O in position 5: 
  Then: ? ? ? E O

And we need to place N and S.

N can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).

S can be in 1,2,3.

Example: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.

If N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.

Example: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.

""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.

Not working.

If N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.

Example: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.

""B U N E O"" -> not a word.

So it's difficult to form a word with O in position 5.

Therefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.

Also, it uses D, which is a common letter.

But note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.

Similarly, O in position 2 is good.

We also test D.

So I'll go with ""SONED"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don't know.

We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.

But we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.

"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? 
  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.

""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.

This is challenging.

Another candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.

But in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.

We can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

So I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.

But wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it's not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn't give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.

So it's okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.

Similarly, we are testing position 2 for O.

So I think it's a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in a different position.

We have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.

Similarly, position 1 for N? We haven't tried.

But in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.

We can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N.

In ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: N
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: D

So we are testing N in position 3.

In ""NOLES"": 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

So we are testing S in position 5.

We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.

I think both test new positions.

But we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.

In ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.

In ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.

But ""BONES"" has O in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.

So let's choose ""SONED"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E is in position 4.
- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).

We are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.
- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.
- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.
- E in position 4: we know it's correct, so ✓.
- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.

This will give us more information.

So, I'll go with ""SONED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed in position 4**.
- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.
- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.
- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).
  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).
  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).
  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).
  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.

Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.\n\n But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That\'s correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.\n\n However, we must avoid using C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it\'s okay.\n\n But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn\'t mean we can\'t put N in position 3? Actually, we can.\n\n However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That\'s allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.\n\n Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\n So ""LINED"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we want to test new letters. Let\'s see: we have L, I, D as new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.\n\n Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.\n\n Some words: \n - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? \n   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.\n\n But wait: what if the word has two N\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it\'s possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\n However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N\'s, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N\'s, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one \'-\' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N\'s, then both would be marked accordingly.\n\n Since we don\'t have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.\n\n Now, let\'s consider ""SINEW"": \n   S (new), I (new), N (we know it\'s present, but in position 3?), E (we know it\'s present, in position 4?), W (new).\n\n But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.\n\n However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have that information for N and E yet.\n\n Another candidate: ""STONE"": \n   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t use that.\n\n How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can\'t move it because it\'s fixed.\n\n Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).\n\n We must avoid A.\n\n Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> \n   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that\'s okay.\n\n However, we are not sure about the positions.\n\n But we also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n ""MELON"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.\n\n Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:\n\n - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> \n   This has two N\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don\'t know about position 3 and 5.\n\n   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.\n\n We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.\n\n Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it\'s not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.\n\n We can try:\n\n Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? \n   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E\'s? and D and S. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E\'s and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.\n\n Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> \n      I: new, N: we know it\'s present, L: new, E: we know it\'s present, T: new.\n\n This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", \n   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? \n\n But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> \n   N is in position 2, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:\n   O: new\n   N: in position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before)\n   S: new\n   E: in position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E before)\n   T: new\n\n This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).\n\n Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.\n\n Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.\n\n So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\n However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> \n   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? \n\n This also avoids C, R, A.\n\n But we are putting E in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s correct. And N in position 5? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing new positions.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don\'t have a correct position for N and E yet.\n\n I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.\n\n Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   In ""ONSET"": \n      Position 1: O (new)\n      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)\n      Position 3: S (new)\n      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)\n      Position 5: T (new)\n\n This is a valid word.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""ONSET"".\n\n But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that\'s okay.\n\n Let me write the guess: ONSET.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that\'s fine.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that\'s fine.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).\n3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).\n4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.\n\nThe word **ONSET** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).\n- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).\n\nThis tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nMeaning:\n- O is in the word but not in position 1.\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- S is in the word but not in position 3.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).\n- T is not in the word.\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).\n\nPresent letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):\n- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).\n- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).\n- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).\n\nAbsent letters:\n- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)\n- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.\n\nNow, let\'s list what we know:\n\nPosition 4 is E.\n\nThe word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don\'t know yet).\n\nSince N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nS is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.\n\nSo the word structure: \nPosition 1: ? \nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: E \nPosition 5: ?\n\nAnd the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don\'t know).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits:\n\n- Has E in position 4.\n- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).\n- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.\n\nWe also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:\n\n- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.\n- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.\n- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.\n\nSimilarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.\n\nIf N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.\n\nWe also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.\n\nWe know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates yet.\n\nWe have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn\'t show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nSo, let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don\'t know.\n\nWe need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).\n\nWe also have position constraints:\n\n- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5\n- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5\n- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5\n\nBut note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.\n\nWe can try to form words:\n\nCase 1: N in position 1.\nThen the word: N _ _ E _\nO can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can\'t be in 2, etc.).\n\nPossible words:\n- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.\n\nBut we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.\n\nWe need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?\n\nWith O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.\n\nExample: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nPossible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: N ? ? E ?\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N\'s? And E in position 4? \n  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). \n  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). \n  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.\n\nWe must have S in the word.\n\nSo: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.\n\nHow about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.\n\n""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? \n  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.\n  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.\n\nAnother word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.\n\n""Noses""? But that\'s 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? \n  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S\'s? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S\'s, that\'s possible? But we don\'t know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.\n\nBut R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated.\n\nBut we are trying to guess, so let\'s consider.\n\nHowever, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.\n\nAnother word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nWhat about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? \n  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?\n\nWith N, O, S, and one more letter.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\n- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters with E in the fourth.\n\nExamples:\n- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N\'s and no S. So no.\n- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? \n  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. \n  But we know S is not in position 3? That\'s not a problem. \n  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. \n  But we don\'t have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.\n\nBut wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.\n\nSo ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nBut we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.\n\nBut we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got \'-\', so it\'s not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven\'t tried that).\n\nBut we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").\n\nIn ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat letters and uses a new letter.\n\nBut we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).\n\nLet me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SONES"" as above.\n- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.\n- ""SONLY""? Not a word.\n- ""SONES"" is a word.\n\nAnother: ""NOISE"" doesn\'t have E in position 4.\n\nWhat about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? \n  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\n""HOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""NOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\n""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.\n\n""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.\n\nWhat about ""NOSED""? But that\'s 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? \n  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.\n  This fits: E in position 4.\n\nBut is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. \n\n""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let\'s look for better.\n\n""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? \n  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). \n  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nWhat about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.\n\nWe need to avoid S in position 3.\n\nSo let\'s try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nCase: S in position 1.\nThen: S ? ? E ?\nAnd O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nExample: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.\n\n""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.\n\n""S O F T E""? But T is absent.\n\n""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: S ? ? E ?\n\nPossible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.\n\nIf N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?\n\nExample: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S\'s? And O in position 2? \n  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. \n  But we know S is not in position 3? That\'s fine. \n  But we have two S\'s? The word ""SONES"" is valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. We can try it.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:\n- S in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.\n- Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.\n\nBut we have to include all of N, O, S and E.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.\n\nWord: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.\n\nExample: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.\n\n""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).\n\n""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.\n\nWe need to use a new letter in position 3.\n\nHow about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nAnother: ""NOSED"" is not standard.\n\n""POSED"" has S in position 3.\n\nLet me try S in position 2.\n\nCase: S in position 2.\nThen: ? S ? E ?\n\nAnd O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).\n\nExample: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.\n\n""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? \n  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S is in position 2 and 5. \n  And O? We don\'t have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.\n\nSo we cannot skip O.\n\nWe must have all of N, O, S, E.\n\nSo if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?\n\nWe need O and N in the remaining positions.\n\nExample: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).\n\nSo O cannot be in position 1.\n\nTherefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.\n\nAnd N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).\n\nSo possibilities:\n- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? \n  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).\n\nIf N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? \n  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.\n\n""NSOE"" is not a word.\n\nIf N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.\n  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.\n\n""USONE""? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nCase: S in position 5.\nThen: ? ? ? E S\n\nO must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).\n\nIf O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S\nN can be in 1 or 3.\n\nExample: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). \n  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This fits: \n    - E in position 4: good.\n    - N in position 1: we haven\'t tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.\n    - O in position 2: we haven\'t tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.\n    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.\n\n  And L is a new letter.\n\n  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.\n\n  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:\n\n- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n- L: new letter, position 3.\n- E: position 4 (correct)\n- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.\n\nAnother possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S\nO must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.\n\nIf O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.\n\nIf O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.\n  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! \n    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This also fits the constraints:\n    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)\n  And B is new.\n\nBut note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven\'t tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.\n\nSimilarly, S in position 5 is new.\n\nSo ""BONES"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".\n\nWe also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).\n\nIn ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.\n\nIn ""BONES"": \n  O is in position 2? We haven\'t tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don\'t have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don\'t test O there. But we haven\'t tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nIn ""NOLES"":\n  O is in position 2? Same as above.\n\nBut in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it\'s B, in ""NOLES"" it\'s L.\n\nBoth are common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don\'t know about B or L.\n\nAnother candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? \n\nWord: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.\n\n""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.\n\n""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.\n\n""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.\n\nSo ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.\n\nWe can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.\n\nWord: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?\n  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). \n  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). \n  This also fits: \n    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.\n  And D is new.\n\n  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.\n\nNow we have three candidates: \n1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)\n2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)\n3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)\n\nWe can choose one that tests new positions.\n\nBut note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nIn ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.\n\nWe know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.\n\nBut we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut note: we are also testing D.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nIf we put O in position 3: \n  Then the word: ? ? O E ?\n\nAnd we need to place N and S.\n\nFor example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).\n\nIf N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N\'s? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.\n\nIf N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.\n\nExample: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.\n\n""US O E N"" not.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nPut O in position 5: \n  Then: ? ? ? E O\n\nAnd we need to place N and S.\n\nN can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).\n\nS can be in 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.\n\nIf N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.\n\nExample: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.\n\n""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.\n\nNot working.\n\nIf N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.\n\nExample: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.\n\n""B U N E O"" -> not a word.\n\nSo it\'s difficult to form a word with O in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, it uses D, which is a common letter.\n\nBut note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.\n\nSimilarly, O in position 2 is good.\n\nWe also test D.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SONED"".\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.\n\nBut we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\n"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.\n\n"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? \n  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.\n\n""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.\n\nBut in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.\n\nWe can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.\n\n""SONLY"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it\'s not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn\'t give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.\n\nSo it\'s okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing position 2 for O.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried in a different position.\n\nWe have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 for N? We haven\'t tried.\n\nBut in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for N.\n\nIn ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": \n  Position 1: S\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: N\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: D\n\nSo we are testing N in position 3.\n\nIn ""NOLES"": \n  Position 1: N\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: S\n\nSo we are testing S in position 5.\n\nWe know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.\n\nI think both test new positions.\n\nBut we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.\n\nIn ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.\n\nIn ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.\n\nBut ""BONES"" has O in position 2.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SONED"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have.\n\nWe know:\n- E is in position 4.\n- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).\n\nWe are testing:\n- S in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.\n- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.\n- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.\n- E in position 4: we know it\'s correct, so ✓.\n- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.\n\nThis will give us more information.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SONED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.\n- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E is fixed in position 4**.\n- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.\n  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.\n  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.\n- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.\n- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.\n- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).\n  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).\n  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).\n  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).\n  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).\n  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.\n\n<guess>soned</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: soned -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""soned"":
  S: - (present but wrong position)
  O: ✓ (correct position)
  N: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  D: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback:

Confirmed:
- Position 4 is E (from guess 2 and now confirmed again).
- O is in the word and in position 2 (now confirmed by guess 4).
- E is in position 4 (already known).

Additionally:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and not in position 2 or 4 (from guess 1).

We also know:
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, T, D (from absent letters in guesses 1,2,4).

Now, let's summarize:

- Position 2 is O (confirmed by guess 4).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed in both).
- S is present, but not in position 1 (from guess 4) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out, and position 2 is O and 4 is E, so the only position left for S is 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
1: unknown, but S cannot be here (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-')
2: O (confirmed)
3: unknown, but N cannot be here (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and S cannot be here (from guess 2: S in position 3 got '-')
4: E (confirmed)
5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only possibility? But what about position 1? We haven't tested S in position 1? Actually, in guess 4, we put S in position 1 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S cannot be in 1. Similarly, not in 3. And 2 and 4 are taken by O and E. So S must be in position 5.

But wait: the word has 5 positions. We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and the only position left is 5? But we also have to place N? 

We know N is present and must be in one of the positions: 1,3. Because:
- Not in 2 (occupied by O)
- Not in 4 (occupied by E)
- Not in 1? We haven't tested N in position 1? Actually, we haven't. But we know N is not in position 2 (from guess 2: N in position 2 got '-') and not in 4 (from guess 1). So N must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is now going to be S? So if position 5 is S, then position 1 must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and 5 is taken by S.

So the word would be: 
Position 1: N? 
Position 2: O
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: S

But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 3. If position 1 is N, then position 3 is something else. If position 1 is not N, then position 1 must be a new letter, and N in position 3.

But we also have S to place. If S is in position 5, then position 1 must be N? Because N and S must be placed, and position 1 is the only one left for N if it's not in 3? But we have two letters to place: N and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? But we have two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? Because we have positions 1,3,5 to fill with N, S, and one new letter? But we have three positions and two known letters? Actually, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? But we know the word has exactly five letters, and we have O, E, and two others: N and S, and one more.

But we have O and E already, and N and S are coming. So the word has O, E, N, S, and one more.

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1: must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and if letter1 is not N, then N must be in 3, and then letter1 is something else, and letter5 must be S? Because S must be in 5? But what if N is in 3 and S is in 5? Then letter1 must be a new letter.

But we know S is present and must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,3,5? But position 1: we haven't tested S there, but we know S is not in 1 (from guess 4). Position 3: we haven't tested S there. But we know S is not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and position 1 is not allowed for S.

But position 5: we haven't tested S there. So it's possible.

But also, N must be in 1 or 3.

So the possibilities:
Option A: N in 1, then S in 5, and then position 3 is a new letter? But we have to fill position 3 and 5? Actually, we have position 3 and 5 to fill, but we have two letters: N and S, and one more.

So the word: N O ? E S

But we know that position 3 must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T,D (absent letters) and not N,O,S,E (if no duplicates). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So position 3 must be a new letter, say X.

Then the word is ""NOXES""? But X is a letter.

But is ""NOXES"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bomb or plural of noxius.

But let's check the constraints for N: 
  N in position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.

But we also have to check for S: in position 5? We know S is not in 1 or 3, so 5 is possible.

But what about position 3? We are putting X there.

But we know S is present, and if we put it in 5, then position 3 must be X.

But we also have to ensure that N is in 1: we haven't tested N in position 1, so it's possible.

But we also have to consider: in guess 1, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in guess 2, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is new.

Similarly, for S: we had S in position 3 (wrong) and in guess 4, we had S in position 1 (wrong). So position 5 is new.

But we are not sure if N can be in 1.

Alternatively, N could be in position 3.

If N is in position 3, then the word: ? O N E ? 

But we need to place S and one more letter.

S cannot be in position 1 (known) and cannot be in position 3 (known). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and 1 is not allowed.

So if N is in 3, then S must be in 5, and position 1 is a new letter.

Then the word: ? O N E S

So position 1: new letter, position 3: N, position 5: S.

We need a word: _ O N E S

What letters can we use? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D.

So position 1: cannot be C,R,A,T,D, and must be a letter not used.

Possible words: 
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> but we have B? 
  But we haven't tested B. 
  However, in guess 4, we had D absent, but B is new.

But ""BONES"" is a word.

But we already have a candidate ""BONES"" from before? Actually, we didn't use it then.

But in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which has D, and D is absent, so ""BONES"" has no D, so it's possible.

But we also have ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> but if N is in position 1, then in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, but we are considering the case where N is in 3? No, in ""NOLES"", N is in 1, which is the same as the option A.

But if we are considering N in position 3, then ""NOLES"" would be: N O L E S -> N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5. So that's option A.

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the letter in position 3? In ""NOLES"", we use L.

But we also have ""BONES"" (B O N E S) which is the same as ""NOLES"" but with B.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

But we need to distinguish between the two cases.

We can try to guess a word that tests between these cases.

But we have to include the known letters: O, E, N, S, and one more.

But we know O, E, N, S are in the word, so we must include them.

We also know position 2 is O and position 4 is E.

So the word pattern: [pos1] O N E S

But we don't know if N is in position 1 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test if it's correctly placed.

But we are forced to put N in 1 or 3.

We can try to put N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to put S in position 5? Then we have the word: N O ? E S

We need a letter for position 3 that forms a word.

Possible letters: not C,R,A,T,D, and not O,N,E,S (if no duplicates). So we have many: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

""NOXES"" (if we accept it) or ""NOLES"" (which is a word) or ""BONES"".

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3, then the word is ? O N E S, and we need a letter for position 1.

Then ""BONES"" is one.

Other words: ""CONES"" but C is absent.

""ONES"" is a word? Yes, but we have O in position 2, so ""ONES"" would be E in position 1? No, ""ONES"" is O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O not in 1).

So position 1 cannot be O? It's fixed as O in position 2.

So for the pattern ? O N E S, position 1 must be a consonant? And ""BONES"" is one.

But we also have ""HONES""? Not a word.

""PONES""? Not common.

""MINES""? But M in position 1? And we have N in position 3? But ""MINES"" has M in 1, I in 3? But we need N in 3? So ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> N in position 3, but position 3 is N? Then O is in position 2? But we have O in position 2? In ""MINES"", position 2 is I? So that doesn't match.

We need position 2 to be O.

So the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and then N in 1 or 3, and S in 5.

So the two main candidates are:
Candidate A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3, and the word is ""NOXES"" or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"")
Candidate B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1, and the word is ""BONES"" or similar)

But we don't know which.

We can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a guess.

We know that in candidate A, position 3 is a letter that is not in the absent list, and in candidate B, position 1 is a letter not in the absent list.

We also know that in candidate A, N is in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and in candidate B, N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested).

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to have S in position 5? Then we have to fill position 1 and 3.

But we can do that.

However, we are constrained: we must have O, E, N, S in the word? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we must include them.

But we are not forced to put S in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test it.

But we are trying to find the word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to guess a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include the known letters.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S somewhere.

Given that S must be in 5, and N in 1 or 3, we can try to guess a word that puts N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? Then we can see if it's valid.

But we need to form a word: ""NO?ES"" -> with ? in position 3.

Possible: ""NOXES"" (if we allow uncommon words) or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"".

But let's see if we can guess a word that tests position 1 for N and position 3 for a new letter.

But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know it must be, but we can confirm.

But we are allowed to guess any valid word.

We can guess ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""BONES"", then we get:
  B: ? 
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: ? (if N is in position 3, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? Because we put N in position 3, but if the word has N in position 1, then we would get N as present but wrong position? But we know N is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's actually in 1, we get '-' for N.

Similarly, if we guess ""BONES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then we get:
  B: absent? Or if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent? So we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓) if S is in 5? But we know S is in 5, so it should be ✓.

But let's simulate:

If secret word is ""NOLES"":
  B: not in word -> x
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, not 3) -> so N(-)
  E: ✓ (position 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

If secret word is ""BONES"":
  B: ✓ (if B is in position 1)
  O: ✓
  N: ✓ (if N is in position 3)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

But we don't know.

We can use this to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess ""BONES"" to test.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 5? Let me see: we have made 4 guesses, so this is guess 5.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we need to form a valid word.

But we don't have many common words that fit the pattern without using absent letters.

Common words:
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""CONES"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""ONES"": O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1. So invalid.
- ""PONES"": not common, and P is new? But not standard.
- ""MINES"": M in position 1? But then position 3 is I? But we need position 2 to be O, so ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> position 2 is I, not O -> invalid.

So only a few options: ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"" (if we allow), but ""NOXES"" is not very common.

""NOLES"" is a word.

But we also have ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but then position 1 is S? But we know S cannot be in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-'). So ""SONES"" is invalid because S in position 1 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SONED"" we already tried and D is absent.

So the main candidates are ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", and perhaps ""NOXES"".

But ""NOXES"" is not as common.

We can try ""BONES"".

But we also have to consider that we might be missing something.

Another candidate: what if the word has the letter in position 1? We haven't tested N in position 1.

But we have to guess.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include O, E, N, S.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S.

We can try to put N in position 1 and S in position 5, and a new letter in position 3: ""NO?ES"".

But we need a valid word: 
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> valid, but less common.

We can choose ""BONES"" because B is a common letter.

But we also have to consider that in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had D at the end and D is absent, so the word doesn't have D.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", we are testing:
  B in position 1: if B is in the word? And if it's in position 1?
  O in position 2: we know it's correct, so ✓.
  N in position 3: we know N is present, but if it's in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N. But we know N is not in 2 or 4, so 3 is possible.
  E in position 4: ✓.
  S in position 5: we know S must be in 5, so it should be ✓.

But if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent, so we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓).

But we don't know if N is in 1 or 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

For example, ""NOLES"": 
  N O L E S

If we guess ""NOLES"", and the secret word is ""BONES"", then:
  N: in position 1? But in ""BONES"", N is in position 3, so N is present but not in 1 -> so N(-)
  O: ✓
  L: new, if L is in the word? But ""BONES"" has B, so L is absent -> L(x)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: N(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(✓)

But we know N is present, so if we get N(-), that means N is not in position 1, so it must be in position 3? Because the only other option is position 3.

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and we have to find the first letter.

Then we can guess ""BONES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to solve it in this guess.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we test candidate B.

For example, ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
  B: absent -> x
  O: ✓
  N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not the absent letters. Then we can try ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to distinguish?

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put a letter in position 3.

But we don't have many options.

We can try ""BONES"" now.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only one left.

And N must be in 1 or 3.

So the word is either:
Option A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3)
Option B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1)

We can try to guess ""BONES"".

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to tell?

If we guess ""BONES"":
  If the word is ""BONES"", we win.

  If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
    B: absent -> x
    O: ✓
    N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
    E: ✓
    S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not absent. Then we can guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more. But we are on the fifth guess, so after this, one more if needed.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to guess the word.

We can also try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put N in position 3? But we are putting N in position 3? Then position 1 is the new letter.

But we don't have a word: ""BONES"" is not a word, and ""SONES"" has S in position 1 which is forbidden.

So I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a good word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess ""NOLES"".

But let's think: we have to make a choice.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in the second guess, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is the only position left for N.

Similarly, S must be in 5.

So I think ""BONES"" is a solid guess.

But let's check the feedback from guess 4: we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is not in 1 and not in 3, so 5 is the only possibility.

Similarly, N not in 2 or 4, so 1 or 3.

But if we put N in position 1 and S in position 5, then we have position 3 to fill.

We can try ""NOLES"".

But I think ""BONES"" is fine.

But we have to avoid using absent letters. D is absent, so ""SONED"" is out.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", what if the word is ""NOLES""? Then we get the feedback as above.

But we can then guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left, so it's okay.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have position 1 and 3: one is the new letter, and the other is not S? But we need S in 5.

So we cannot test both at once.

Therefore, I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""BONES"".

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a word.

Or a word that has N in position 3? But then we don't test position 1 for N.

We have to choose one.

I think ""BONES"" is the best.

So, fourth guess: ""BONES""

But let's write it.

But we must not use absent letters. B is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BONES"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.
- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.
- **O** is fixed in **position 2** (confirmed by Guess 4).
- **S** must be in **position 5** because:
  - S is present (from Guess 2 and 4).
  - S cannot be in position 1 (Guess 4: S in position 1 → '-') or 3 (Guess 2: S in position 3 → '-').
  - Positions 2 and 4 are occupied by O and E, so S must be in 5.
- **N** must be in **position 1 or 3**:
  - N is present (from all guesses) but cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2), 4 (Guess 1), or 3 (Guess 4). Thus, N must be in 1 or 3.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D (cannot appear).
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).

### Deduced Word Structure:
The secret word must be of the form:
- **Position 1**: N (if not, then position 3 must be N) 
- **Position 2**: O (fixed)
- **Position 3**: ? (if N is in 1, then position 3 is a new letter; if N is in 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- **Position 4**: E (fixed)
- **Position 5**: S (deduced)

Thus, two candidate word patterns:
1. **N O ? E S** (e.g., ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"")
2. **? O N E S** (e.g., ""BONES"" is invalid because S cannot be in position 1, so this is only if N is in position 3)

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Test **BONES** to resolve the ambiguity between the two patterns:
  - If correct, we solve the word.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOLES** (since ""NOLES"" is the only other common word fitting pattern 1).

**Why BONES?**
- Tests **N in position 1** (if correct, we confirm; if not, N must be in position 3).
- Tests **S in position 5** (already deduced, but we need to confirm the fifth letter).
- Uses **B** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 1 to probe for the missing letter.

This guess will either:
- Confirm the word (if N in 1 and S in 5 are correct).
- Reveal that N must be in position 3 (and the word is ? O N E S) if N is marked as present but wrong position (while S is correct in position 5).

<guess>bones</guess>",bones,"We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""soned"":
  S: - (present but wrong position)
  O: ✓ (correct position)
  N: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  D: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback:

Confirmed:
- Position 4 is E (from guess 2 and now confirmed again).
- O is in the word and in position 2 (now confirmed by guess 4).
- E is in position 4 (already known).

Additionally:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and not in position 2 or 4 (from guess 1).

We also know:
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, T, D (from absent letters in guesses 1,2,4).

Now, let's summarize:

- Position 2 is O (confirmed by guess 4).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed in both).
- S is present, but not in position 1 (from guess 4) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out, and position 2 is O and 4 is E, so the only position left for S is 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
1: unknown, but S cannot be here (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-')
2: O (confirmed)
3: unknown, but N cannot be here (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and S cannot be here (from guess 2: S in position 3 got '-')
4: E (confirmed)
5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only possibility? But what about position 1? We haven't tested S in position 1? Actually, in guess 4, we put S in position 1 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S cannot be in 1. Similarly, not in 3. And 2 and 4 are taken by O and E. So S must be in position 5.

But wait: the word has 5 positions. We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and the only position left is 5? But we also have to place N? 

We know N is present and must be in one of the positions: 1,3. Because:
- Not in 2 (occupied by O)
- Not in 4 (occupied by E)
- Not in 1? We haven't tested N in position 1? Actually, we haven't. But we know N is not in position 2 (from guess 2: N in position 2 got '-') and not in 4 (from guess 1). So N must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is now going to be S? So if position 5 is S, then position 1 must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and 5 is taken by S.

So the word would be: 
Position 1: N? 
Position 2: O
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: S

But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 3. If position 1 is N, then position 3 is something else. If position 1 is not N, then position 1 must be a new letter, and N in position 3.

But we also have S to place. If S is in position 5, then position 1 must be N? Because N and S must be placed, and position 1 is the only one left for N if it's not in 3? But we have two letters to place: N and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? But we have two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? Because we have positions 1,3,5 to fill with N, S, and one new letter? But we have three positions and two known letters? Actually, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? But we know the word has exactly five letters, and we have O, E, and two others: N and S, and one more.

But we have O and E already, and N and S are coming. So the word has O, E, N, S, and one more.

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1: must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and if letter1 is not N, then N must be in 3, and then letter1 is something else, and letter5 must be S? Because S must be in 5? But what if N is in 3 and S is in 5? Then letter1 must be a new letter.

But we know S is present and must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,3,5? But position 1: we haven't tested S there, but we know S is not in 1 (from guess 4). Position 3: we haven't tested S there. But we know S is not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and position 1 is not allowed for S.

But position 5: we haven't tested S there. So it's possible.

But also, N must be in 1 or 3.

So the possibilities:
Option A: N in 1, then S in 5, and then position 3 is a new letter? But we have to fill position 3 and 5? Actually, we have position 3 and 5 to fill, but we have two letters: N and S, and one more.

So the word: N O ? E S

But we know that position 3 must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T,D (absent letters) and not N,O,S,E (if no duplicates). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So position 3 must be a new letter, say X.

Then the word is ""NOXES""? But X is a letter.

But is ""NOXES"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bomb or plural of noxius.

But let's check the constraints for N: 
  N in position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.

But we also have to check for S: in position 5? We know S is not in 1 or 3, so 5 is possible.

But what about position 3? We are putting X there.

But we know S is present, and if we put it in 5, then position 3 must be X.

But we also have to ensure that N is in 1: we haven't tested N in position 1, so it's possible.

But we also have to consider: in guess 1, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in guess 2, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is new.

Similarly, for S: we had S in position 3 (wrong) and in guess 4, we had S in position 1 (wrong). So position 5 is new.

But we are not sure if N can be in 1.

Alternatively, N could be in position 3.

If N is in position 3, then the word: ? O N E ? 

But we need to place S and one more letter.

S cannot be in position 1 (known) and cannot be in position 3 (known). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and 1 is not allowed.

So if N is in 3, then S must be in 5, and position 1 is a new letter.

Then the word: ? O N E S

So position 1: new letter, position 3: N, position 5: S.

We need a word: _ O N E S

What letters can we use? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D.

So position 1: cannot be C,R,A,T,D, and must be a letter not used.

Possible words: 
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> but we have B? 
  But we haven't tested B. 
  However, in guess 4, we had D absent, but B is new.

But ""BONES"" is a word.

But we already have a candidate ""BONES"" from before? Actually, we didn't use it then.

But in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which has D, and D is absent, so ""BONES"" has no D, so it's possible.

But we also have ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> but if N is in position 1, then in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, but we are considering the case where N is in 3? No, in ""NOLES"", N is in 1, which is the same as the option A.

But if we are considering N in position 3, then ""NOLES"" would be: N O L E S -> N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5. So that's option A.

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the letter in position 3? In ""NOLES"", we use L.

But we also have ""BONES"" (B O N E S) which is the same as ""NOLES"" but with B.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

But we need to distinguish between the two cases.

We can try to guess a word that tests between these cases.

But we have to include the known letters: O, E, N, S, and one more.

But we know O, E, N, S are in the word, so we must include them.

We also know position 2 is O and position 4 is E.

So the word pattern: [pos1] O N E S

But we don't know if N is in position 1 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test if it's correctly placed.

But we are forced to put N in 1 or 3.

We can try to put N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to put S in position 5? Then we have the word: N O ? E S

We need a letter for position 3 that forms a word.

Possible letters: not C,R,A,T,D, and not O,N,E,S (if no duplicates). So we have many: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

""NOXES"" (if we accept it) or ""NOLES"" (which is a word) or ""BONES"".

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3, then the word is ? O N E S, and we need a letter for position 1.

Then ""BONES"" is one.

Other words: ""CONES"" but C is absent.

""ONES"" is a word? Yes, but we have O in position 2, so ""ONES"" would be E in position 1? No, ""ONES"" is O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O not in 1).

So position 1 cannot be O? It's fixed as O in position 2.

So for the pattern ? O N E S, position 1 must be a consonant? And ""BONES"" is one.

But we also have ""HONES""? Not a word.

""PONES""? Not common.

""MINES""? But M in position 1? And we have N in position 3? But ""MINES"" has M in 1, I in 3? But we need N in 3? So ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> N in position 3, but position 3 is N? Then O is in position 2? But we have O in position 2? In ""MINES"", position 2 is I? So that doesn't match.

We need position 2 to be O.

So the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and then N in 1 or 3, and S in 5.

So the two main candidates are:
Candidate A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3, and the word is ""NOXES"" or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"")
Candidate B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1, and the word is ""BONES"" or similar)

But we don't know which.

We can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a guess.

We know that in candidate A, position 3 is a letter that is not in the absent list, and in candidate B, position 1 is a letter not in the absent list.

We also know that in candidate A, N is in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and in candidate B, N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested).

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to have S in position 5? Then we have to fill position 1 and 3.

But we can do that.

However, we are constrained: we must have O, E, N, S in the word? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we must include them.

But we are not forced to put S in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test it.

But we are trying to find the word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to guess a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include the known letters.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S somewhere.

Given that S must be in 5, and N in 1 or 3, we can try to guess a word that puts N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? Then we can see if it's valid.

But we need to form a word: ""NO?ES"" -> with ? in position 3.

Possible: ""NOXES"" (if we allow uncommon words) or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"".

But let's see if we can guess a word that tests position 1 for N and position 3 for a new letter.

But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know it must be, but we can confirm.

But we are allowed to guess any valid word.

We can guess ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""BONES"", then we get:
  B: ? 
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: ? (if N is in position 3, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? Because we put N in position 3, but if the word has N in position 1, then we would get N as present but wrong position? But we know N is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's actually in 1, we get '-' for N.

Similarly, if we guess ""BONES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then we get:
  B: absent? Or if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent? So we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓) if S is in 5? But we know S is in 5, so it should be ✓.

But let's simulate:

If secret word is ""NOLES"":
  B: not in word -> x
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, not 3) -> so N(-)
  E: ✓ (position 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

If secret word is ""BONES"":
  B: ✓ (if B is in position 1)
  O: ✓
  N: ✓ (if N is in position 3)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

But we don't know.

We can use this to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess ""BONES"" to test.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 5? Let me see: we have made 4 guesses, so this is guess 5.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we need to form a valid word.

But we don't have many common words that fit the pattern without using absent letters.

Common words:
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""CONES"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""ONES"": O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1. So invalid.
- ""PONES"": not common, and P is new? But not standard.
- ""MINES"": M in position 1? But then position 3 is I? But we need position 2 to be O, so ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> position 2 is I, not O -> invalid.

So only a few options: ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"" (if we allow), but ""NOXES"" is not very common.

""NOLES"" is a word.

But we also have ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but then position 1 is S? But we know S cannot be in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-'). So ""SONES"" is invalid because S in position 1 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SONED"" we already tried and D is absent.

So the main candidates are ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", and perhaps ""NOXES"".

But ""NOXES"" is not as common.

We can try ""BONES"".

But we also have to consider that we might be missing something.

Another candidate: what if the word has the letter in position 1? We haven't tested N in position 1.

But we have to guess.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include O, E, N, S.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S.

We can try to put N in position 1 and S in position 5, and a new letter in position 3: ""NO?ES"".

But we need a valid word: 
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> valid, but less common.

We can choose ""BONES"" because B is a common letter.

But we also have to consider that in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had D at the end and D is absent, so the word doesn't have D.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", we are testing:
  B in position 1: if B is in the word? And if it's in position 1?
  O in position 2: we know it's correct, so ✓.
  N in position 3: we know N is present, but if it's in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N. But we know N is not in 2 or 4, so 3 is possible.
  E in position 4: ✓.
  S in position 5: we know S must be in 5, so it should be ✓.

But if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent, so we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓).

But we don't know if N is in 1 or 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

For example, ""NOLES"": 
  N O L E S

If we guess ""NOLES"", and the secret word is ""BONES"", then:
  N: in position 1? But in ""BONES"", N is in position 3, so N is present but not in 1 -> so N(-)
  O: ✓
  L: new, if L is in the word? But ""BONES"" has B, so L is absent -> L(x)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: N(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(✓)

But we know N is present, so if we get N(-), that means N is not in position 1, so it must be in position 3? Because the only other option is position 3.

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and we have to find the first letter.

Then we can guess ""BONES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to solve it in this guess.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we test candidate B.

For example, ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
  B: absent -> x
  O: ✓
  N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not the absent letters. Then we can try ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to distinguish?

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put a letter in position 3.

But we don't have many options.

We can try ""BONES"" now.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only one left.

And N must be in 1 or 3.

So the word is either:
Option A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3)
Option B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1)

We can try to guess ""BONES"".

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to tell?

If we guess ""BONES"":
  If the word is ""BONES"", we win.

  If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
    B: absent -> x
    O: ✓
    N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
    E: ✓
    S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not absent. Then we can guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more. But we are on the fifth guess, so after this, one more if needed.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to guess the word.

We can also try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put N in position 3? But we are putting N in position 3? Then position 1 is the new letter.

But we don't have a word: ""BONES"" is not a word, and ""SONES"" has S in position 1 which is forbidden.

So I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a good word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess ""NOLES"".

But let's think: we have to make a choice.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in the second guess, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is the only position left for N.

Similarly, S must be in 5.

So I think ""BONES"" is a solid guess.

But let's check the feedback from guess 4: we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is not in 1 and not in 3, so 5 is the only possibility.

Similarly, N not in 2 or 4, so 1 or 3.

But if we put N in position 1 and S in position 5, then we have position 3 to fill.

We can try ""NOLES"".

But I think ""BONES"" is fine.

But we have to avoid using absent letters. D is absent, so ""SONED"" is out.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", what if the word is ""NOLES""? Then we get the feedback as above.

But we can then guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left, so it's okay.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have position 1 and 3: one is the new letter, and the other is not S? But we need S in 5.

So we cannot test both at once.

Therefore, I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""BONES"".

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a word.

Or a word that has N in position 3? But then we don't test position 1 for N.

We have to choose one.

I think ""BONES"" is the best.

So, fourth guess: ""BONES""

But let's write it.

But we must not use absent letters. B is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BONES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.
- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.
- **O** is fixed in **position 2** (confirmed by Guess 4).
- **S** must be in **position 5** because:
  - S is present (from Guess 2 and 4).
  - S cannot be in position 1 (Guess 4: S in position 1 → '-') or 3 (Guess 2: S in position 3 → '-').
  - Positions 2 and 4 are occupied by O and E, so S must be in 5.
- **N** must be in **position 1 or 3**:
  - N is present (from all guesses) but cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2), 4 (Guess 1), or 3 (Guess 4). Thus, N must be in 1 or 3.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D (cannot appear).
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).

### Deduced Word Structure:
The secret word must be of the form:
- **Position 1**: N (if not, then position 3 must be N) 
- **Position 2**: O (fixed)
- **Position 3**: ? (if N is in 1, then position 3 is a new letter; if N is in 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- **Position 4**: E (fixed)
- **Position 5**: S (deduced)

Thus, two candidate word patterns:
1. **N O ? E S** (e.g., ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"")
2. **? O N E S** (e.g., ""BONES"" is invalid because S cannot be in position 1, so this is only if N is in position 3)

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Test **BONES** to resolve the ambiguity between the two patterns:
  - If correct, we solve the word.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOLES** (since ""NOLES"" is the only other common word fitting pattern 1).

**Why BONES?**
- Tests **N in position 1** (if correct, we confirm; if not, N must be in position 3).
- Tests **S in position 5** (already deduced, but we need to confirm the fifth letter).
- Uses **B** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 1 to probe for the missing letter.

This guess will either:
- Confirm the word (if N in 1 and S in 5 are correct).
- Reveal that N must be in position 3 (and the word is ? O N E S) if N is marked as present but wrong position (while S is correct in position 5).",Guess 5: bones -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, R, A are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letter N is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it in the fourth position and it was marked as wrong position).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 Since N is in the word but not in the fourth position, and E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, R, A (because they are not in the word).
 2. Must contain N and E (since they are present).
 3. The N cannot be in the fourth position (because we already tried that and it was wrong).
 4. The E cannot be in the fifth position.

 Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

 Let's think of words that have N and E, and avoid C, R, A.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have 2 known letters (N and E) but we don't know their positions.

 We can try to place N and E in different positions and include other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid C, R, A.

 Common letters to try: S, T, L, O, etc.

 We also know that N is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.

 Let's try to form a word that has:
 - E and N, and three new letters.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D -> but note we have N in position 3 and E in position 4? 
   However, we know N cannot be in position 4? Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.

 But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That's correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.

 However, we must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it's okay.

 But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn't mean we can't put N in position 3? Actually, we can.

 However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That's allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn't say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.

 Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).

 So ""LINED"" is a candidate.

 However, we want to test new letters. Let's see: we have L, I, D as new letters.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.

 Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.

 Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.

 Some words: 
 - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.

 But wait: what if the word has two N's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it's possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don't know for sure.

 However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.

 But note: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N's, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one '-' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N's, then both would be marked accordingly.

 Since we don't have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.

 Now, let's consider ""SINEW"": 
   S (new), I (new), N (we know it's present, but in position 3?), E (we know it's present, in position 4?), W (new).

 But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.

 However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? We don't have that information for N and E yet.

 Another candidate: ""STONE"": 
   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it's not there.

 In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that's wrong, so we shouldn't use that.

 How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can't move it because it's fixed.

 Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).

 We must avoid A.

 Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> 
   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that's okay.

 However, we are not sure about the positions.

 But we also have to avoid C, R, A.

 ""MELON"" doesn't have them.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.

 Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:

 - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? 
   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That's correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> 
   This has two N's. But we don't know if the word has two N's. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don't know about position 3 and 5.

   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.

 - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.

 We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.

 Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it's not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.

 We can try:

 Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? 
   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E's? and D and S. But note: we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E's, then we might get two marks? But we don't know.

 However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E's and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.

 Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.

 Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? 
   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> 
      I: new, N: we know it's present, L: new, E: we know it's present, T: new.

 This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", 
   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? 

 But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That's allowed.

 However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> 
   N is in position 2, E in position 4? 

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.

 I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:
   O: new
   N: in position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before)
   S: new
   E: in position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E before)
   T: new

 This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).

 Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.

 Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.

 So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.

 However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don't know. We are testing.

 Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> 
   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? 
   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? 

 This also avoids C, R, A.

 But we are putting E in position 3? We don't know if that's correct. And N in position 5? We don't know.

 However, we are testing new positions.

 But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don't have a correct position for N and E yet.

 I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.

 Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

 So, I'll go with ""ONSET"".

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.

 Let me confirm: 
   In ""ONSET"": 
      Position 1: O (new)
      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)
      Position 3: S (new)
      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)
      Position 5: T (new)

 This is a valid word.

 So, I'll guess ""ONSET"".

 But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that's okay.

 Let me write the guess: ONSET.

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that's fine.

 Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that's fine.

 Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.
- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).
3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).
4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.

The word **ONSET** fits these criteria:
- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).
- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).

This tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Meaning:
- O is in the word but not in position 1.
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).
- T is not in the word.

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).

Present letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):
- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).
- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).

Absent letters:
- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)
- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.

Now, let's list what we know:

Position 4 is E.

The word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don't know yet).

Since N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Similarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

S is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.

So the word structure: 
Position 1: ? 
Position 2: ? 
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E 
Position 5: ?

And the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don't know).

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.

We need to find a word that fits:

- Has E in position 4.
- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).
- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.

We also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:

- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.
- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.
- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.

But note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.

Similarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.

If N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.

We also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.

We know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates yet.

We have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn't show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don't know.

But to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.

So, let's assume no duplicates for now.

We have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don't know.

We need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).

We also have position constraints:

- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5
- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5
- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5

But note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.

We can try to form words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
Then the word: N _ _ E _
O can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can't be in 2, etc.).

Possible words:
- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.

But we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.

We need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?

With O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.

Example: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Possible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: N ? ? E ?

Let me think of words: 
- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N's? And E in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). 
  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). 
  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.

We must have S in the word.

So: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.

How about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.

""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.
  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Another word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.

""Noses""? But that's 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S's? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S's, that's possible? But we don't know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.

But R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's duplicated.

But we are trying to guess, so let's consider.

However, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.

Another word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? 
  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?

With N, O, S, and one more letter.

Let me list possible words:

- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters with E in the fourth.

Examples:
- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N's and no S. So no.
- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's not a problem. 
  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. 
  But we don't have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.

But wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.

So ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S's? And we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.

But we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got '-', so it's not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven't tried that).

But we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").

In ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.

But we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat letters and uses a new letter.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.

We need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).

Let me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""SONES"" as above.
- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.
- ""SONLY""? Not a word.
- ""SONES"" is a word.

Another: ""NOISE"" doesn't have E in position 4.

What about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? 
  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.

""HOSE"" is 4 letters.

""NOSE"" is 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.

""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.

What about ""NOSED""? But that's 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? 
  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.
  This fits: E in position 4.

But is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. 

""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let's look for better.

""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? 
  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). 
  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

Similarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.

What about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.

We need to avoid S in position 3.

So let's try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.

Case: S in position 1.
Then: S ? ? E ?
And O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.

Example: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.

""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.

""S O F T E""? But T is absent.

""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: S ? ? E ?

Possible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.

If N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?

Example: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S's? And O in position 2? 
  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. 
  But we know S is not in position 3? That's fine. 
  But we have two S's? The word ""SONES"" is valid.

But we don't know if the word has two S's. We can try it.

But let's see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for other positions.

But we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.

But we have to include all of N, O, S and E.

Another idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.

Word: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.

Example: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.

""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).

""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.

We need to use a new letter in position 3.

How about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.

We need E in position 4.

Another: ""NOSED"" is not standard.

""POSED"" has S in position 3.

Let me try S in position 2.

Case: S in position 2.
Then: ? S ? E ?

And O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).

Example: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.

""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? 
  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  But S is in position 2 and 5. 
  And O? We don't have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.

So we cannot skip O.

We must have all of N, O, S, E.

So if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?

We need O and N in the remaining positions.

Example: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).

So O cannot be in position 1.

Therefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.

And N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).

So possibilities:
- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? 
  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).

If N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? 
  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.

""NSOE"" is not a word.

If N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.
  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.

""USONE""? Not a word.

This is difficult.

Case: S in position 5.
Then: ? ? ? E S

O must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).

If O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S
N can be in 1 or 3.

Example: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). 
  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This fits: 
    - E in position 4: good.
    - N in position 1: we haven't tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.
    - O in position 2: we haven't tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.
    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.

  And L is a new letter.

  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.

  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.

But note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:

- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
- L: new letter, position 3.
- E: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)

This seems good.

But is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.

Another possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S
O must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.

If O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.

If O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.
  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! 
    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This also fits the constraints:
    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)
  And B is new.

But note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven't tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.

Similarly, S in position 5 is new.

So ""BONES"" is a candidate.

But we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".

We also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).

In ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.

We can choose one.

But we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.

In ""BONES"": 
  O is in position 2? We haven't tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don't have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don't test O there. But we haven't tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.

In ""NOLES"":
  O is in position 2? Same as above.

But in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.

We also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it's B, in ""NOLES"" it's L.

Both are common letters.

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don't know about B or L.

Another candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? 

Word: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.

""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.

""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.

""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.

So ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.

We can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.

Word: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?
  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). 
  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). 
  This also fits: 
    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)
    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)
    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.
  And D is new.

  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.

Now we have three candidates: 
1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)
3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)

We can choose one that tests new positions.

But note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tested.

In ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.

We know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.

But we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.

Similarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are also testing D.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.

But let's see.

If we put O in position 3: 
  Then the word: ? ? O E ?

And we need to place N and S.

For example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).

If N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N's? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.

If N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.

Example: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.

""US O E N"" not.

This is hard.

Put O in position 5: 
  Then: ? ? ? E O

And we need to place N and S.

N can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).

S can be in 1,2,3.

Example: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.

If N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.

Example: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.

""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.

Not working.

If N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.

Example: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.

""B U N E O"" -> not a word.

So it's difficult to form a word with O in position 5.

Therefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.

Also, it uses D, which is a common letter.

But note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.

Similarly, O in position 2 is good.

We also test D.

So I'll go with ""SONED"".

But let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don't know.

We are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.

But we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.

We need E in position 4.

So: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.

"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? 
  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.

""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.

This is challenging.

Another candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.

I think ""SONED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.

But in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.

We can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.

""SONLY"" not a word.

So I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.

But wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it's in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it's not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn't give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.

So it's okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.

Similarly, we are testing position 2 for O.

So I think it's a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried in a different position.

We have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.

Similarly, position 1 for N? We haven't tried.

But in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.

We can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.

I think both are good.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N.

In ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: N
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: D

So we are testing N in position 3.

In ""NOLES"": 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: O
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: E
  Position 5: S

So we are testing S in position 5.

We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.

I think both test new positions.

But we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.

In ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.

In ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.

But ""BONES"" has O in position 2.

I think I'll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.

So let's choose ""SONED"".

But wait: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E is in position 4.
- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).

We are testing:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.
- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.
- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.
- E in position 4: we know it's correct, so ✓.
- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.

This will give us more information.

So, I'll go with ""SONED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed in position 4**.
- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.
  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.
- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.
- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).
  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).
  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).
  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).
  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).
  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).

This guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.

<guess>soned</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)
Model answer is not in the correct format
Guess 4: soned -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""soned"":
  S: - (present but wrong position)
  O: ✓ (correct position)
  N: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  D: x (not in the word)

So, from all feedback:

Confirmed:
- Position 4 is E (from guess 2 and now confirmed again).
- O is in the word and in position 2 (now confirmed by guess 4).
- E is in position 4 (already known).

Additionally:
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and not in position 2 or 4 (from guess 1).

We also know:
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, T, D (from absent letters in guesses 1,2,4).

Now, let's summarize:

- Position 2 is O (confirmed by guess 4).
- Position 4 is E (confirmed in both).
- S is present, but not in position 1 (from guess 4) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out, and position 2 is O and 4 is E, so the only position left for S is 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
1: unknown, but S cannot be here (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-')
2: O (confirmed)
3: unknown, but N cannot be here (from guess 4: N in position 3 got '-') and S cannot be here (from guess 2: S in position 3 got '-')
4: E (confirmed)
5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only possibility? But what about position 1? We haven't tested S in position 1? Actually, in guess 4, we put S in position 1 and got '-', meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S cannot be in 1. Similarly, not in 3. And 2 and 4 are taken by O and E. So S must be in position 5.

But wait: the word has 5 positions. We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and the only position left is 5? But we also have to place N? 

We know N is present and must be in one of the positions: 1,3. Because:
- Not in 2 (occupied by O)
- Not in 4 (occupied by E)
- Not in 1? We haven't tested N in position 1? Actually, we haven't. But we know N is not in position 2 (from guess 2: N in position 2 got '-') and not in 4 (from guess 1). So N must be in position 1 or 3.

But position 5 is now going to be S? So if position 5 is S, then position 1 must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and 5 is taken by S.

So the word would be: 
Position 1: N? 
Position 2: O
Position 3: ? 
Position 4: E
Position 5: S

But we know N is present and must be in 1 or 3. If position 1 is N, then position 3 is something else. If position 1 is not N, then position 1 must be a new letter, and N in position 3.

But we also have S to place. If S is in position 5, then position 1 must be N? Because N and S must be placed, and position 1 is the only one left for N if it's not in 3? But we have two letters to place: N and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? But we have two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? Because we have positions 1,3,5 to fill with N, S, and one new letter? But we have three positions and two known letters? Actually, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? But we know the word has exactly five letters, and we have O, E, and two others: N and S, and one more.

But we have O and E already, and N and S are coming. So the word has O, E, N, S, and one more.

So the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E [letter5]

Constraints:
- letter1: must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and if letter1 is not N, then N must be in 3, and then letter1 is something else, and letter5 must be S? Because S must be in 5? But what if N is in 3 and S is in 5? Then letter1 must be a new letter.

But we know S is present and must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,3,5? But position 1: we haven't tested S there, but we know S is not in 1 (from guess 4). Position 3: we haven't tested S there. But we know S is not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and position 1 is not allowed for S.

But position 5: we haven't tested S there. So it's possible.

But also, N must be in 1 or 3.

So the possibilities:
Option A: N in 1, then S in 5, and then position 3 is a new letter? But we have to fill position 3 and 5? Actually, we have position 3 and 5 to fill, but we have two letters: N and S, and one more.

So the word: N O ? E S

But we know that position 3 must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T,D (absent letters) and not N,O,S,E (if no duplicates). But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

So position 3 must be a new letter, say X.

Then the word is ""NOXES""? But X is a letter.

But is ""NOXES"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bomb or plural of noxius.

But let's check the constraints for N: 
  N in position 1: we haven't tested position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.

But we also have to check for S: in position 5? We know S is not in 1 or 3, so 5 is possible.

But what about position 3? We are putting X there.

But we know S is present, and if we put it in 5, then position 3 must be X.

But we also have to ensure that N is in 1: we haven't tested N in position 1, so it's possible.

But we also have to consider: in guess 1, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in guess 2, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is new.

Similarly, for S: we had S in position 3 (wrong) and in guess 4, we had S in position 1 (wrong). So position 5 is new.

But we are not sure if N can be in 1.

Alternatively, N could be in position 3.

If N is in position 3, then the word: ? O N E ? 

But we need to place S and one more letter.

S cannot be in position 1 (known) and cannot be in position 3 (known). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and 1 is not allowed.

So if N is in 3, then S must be in 5, and position 1 is a new letter.

Then the word: ? O N E S

So position 1: new letter, position 3: N, position 5: S.

We need a word: _ O N E S

What letters can we use? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D.

So position 1: cannot be C,R,A,T,D, and must be a letter not used.

Possible words: 
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> but we have B? 
  But we haven't tested B. 
  However, in guess 4, we had D absent, but B is new.

But ""BONES"" is a word.

But we already have a candidate ""BONES"" from before? Actually, we didn't use it then.

But in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which has D, and D is absent, so ""BONES"" has no D, so it's possible.

But we also have ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> but if N is in position 1, then in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, but we are considering the case where N is in 3? No, in ""NOLES"", N is in 1, which is the same as the option A.

But if we are considering N in position 3, then ""NOLES"" would be: N O L E S -> N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5. So that's option A.

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the letter in position 3? In ""NOLES"", we use L.

But we also have ""BONES"" (B O N E S) which is the same as ""NOLES"" but with B.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

But we need to distinguish between the two cases.

We can try to guess a word that tests between these cases.

But we have to include the known letters: O, E, N, S, and one more.

But we know O, E, N, S are in the word, so we must include them.

We also know position 2 is O and position 4 is E.

So the word pattern: [pos1] O N E S

But we don't know if N is in position 1 or 3.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test if it's correctly placed.

But we are forced to put N in 1 or 3.

We can try to put N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to put S in position 5? Then we have the word: N O ? E S

We need a letter for position 3 that forms a word.

Possible letters: not C,R,A,T,D, and not O,N,E,S (if no duplicates). So we have many: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters.

""NOXES"" (if we accept it) or ""NOLES"" (which is a word) or ""BONES"".

But we also have the possibility that N is in position 3, then the word is ? O N E S, and we need a letter for position 1.

Then ""BONES"" is one.

Other words: ""CONES"" but C is absent.

""ONES"" is a word? Yes, but we have O in position 2, so ""ONES"" would be E in position 1? No, ""ONES"" is O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O not in 1).

So position 1 cannot be O? It's fixed as O in position 2.

So for the pattern ? O N E S, position 1 must be a consonant? And ""BONES"" is one.

But we also have ""HONES""? Not a word.

""PONES""? Not common.

""MINES""? But M in position 1? And we have N in position 3? But ""MINES"" has M in 1, I in 3? But we need N in 3? So ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> N in position 3, but position 3 is N? Then O is in position 2? But we have O in position 2? In ""MINES"", position 2 is I? So that doesn't match.

We need position 2 to be O.

So the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and then N in 1 or 3, and S in 5.

So the two main candidates are:
Candidate A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3, and the word is ""NOXES"" or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"")
Candidate B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1, and the word is ""BONES"" or similar)

But we don't know which.

We can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a guess.

We know that in candidate A, position 3 is a letter that is not in the absent list, and in candidate B, position 1 is a letter not in the absent list.

We also know that in candidate A, N is in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and in candidate B, N is in position 3 (which we haven't tested).

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to have S in position 5? Then we have to fill position 1 and 3.

But we can do that.

However, we are constrained: we must have O, E, N, S in the word? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we must include them.

But we are not forced to put S in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test it.

But we are trying to find the word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to guess a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include the known letters.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S somewhere.

Given that S must be in 5, and N in 1 or 3, we can try to guess a word that puts N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? Then we can see if it's valid.

But we need to form a word: ""NO?ES"" -> with ? in position 3.

Possible: ""NOXES"" (if we allow uncommon words) or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"".

But let's see if we can guess a word that tests position 1 for N and position 3 for a new letter.

But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know it must be, but we can confirm.

But we are allowed to guess any valid word.

We can guess ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""BONES"", then we get:
  B: ? 
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: ? (if N is in position 3, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? Because we put N in position 3, but if the word has N in position 1, then we would get N as present but wrong position? But we know N is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's actually in 1, we get '-' for N.

Similarly, if we guess ""BONES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then we get:
  B: absent? Or if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent? So we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓) if S is in 5? But we know S is in 5, so it should be ✓.

But let's simulate:

If secret word is ""NOLES"":
  B: not in word -> x
  O: ✓ (position 2)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, not 3) -> so N(-)
  E: ✓ (position 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

If secret word is ""BONES"":
  B: ✓ (if B is in position 1)
  O: ✓
  N: ✓ (if N is in position 3)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

But we don't know.

We can use this to test.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.

But we have to choose.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess ""BONES"" to test.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 5? Let me see: we have made 4 guesses, so this is guess 5.

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we need to form a valid word.

But we don't have many common words that fit the pattern without using absent letters.

Common words:
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""CONES"": C is absent -> invalid.
- ""ONES"": O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1. So invalid.
- ""PONES"": not common, and P is new? But not standard.
- ""MINES"": M in position 1? But then position 3 is I? But we need position 2 to be O, so ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> position 2 is I, not O -> invalid.

So only a few options: ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"" (if we allow), but ""NOXES"" is not very common.

""NOLES"" is a word.

But we also have ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but then position 1 is S? But we know S cannot be in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got '-'). So ""SONES"" is invalid because S in position 1 is forbidden.

Similarly, ""SONED"" we already tried and D is absent.

So the main candidates are ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", and perhaps ""NOXES"".

But ""NOXES"" is not as common.

We can try ""BONES"".

But we also have to consider that we might be missing something.

Another candidate: what if the word has the letter in position 1? We haven't tested N in position 1.

But we have to guess.

We can also try to use a word that doesn't assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include O, E, N, S.

But we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S.

We can try to put N in position 1 and S in position 5, and a new letter in position 3: ""NO?ES"".

But we need a valid word: 
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.
- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> valid, but less common.

We can choose ""BONES"" because B is a common letter.

But we also have to consider that in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had D at the end and D is absent, so the word doesn't have D.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", we are testing:
  B in position 1: if B is in the word? And if it's in position 1?
  O in position 2: we know it's correct, so ✓.
  N in position 3: we know N is present, but if it's in position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for N. But we know N is not in 2 or 4, so 3 is possible.
  E in position 4: ✓.
  S in position 5: we know S must be in 5, so it should be ✓.

But if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent, so we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it's in 1), and S(✓).

But we don't know if N is in 1 or 3.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

For example, ""NOLES"": 
  N O L E S

If we guess ""NOLES"", and the secret word is ""BONES"", then:
  N: in position 1? But in ""BONES"", N is in position 3, so N is present but not in 1 -> so N(-)
  O: ✓
  L: new, if L is in the word? But ""BONES"" has B, so L is absent -> L(x)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: N(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(✓)

But we know N is present, so if we get N(-), that means N is not in position 1, so it must be in position 3? Because the only other option is position 3.

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and we have to find the first letter.

Then we can guess ""BONES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to solve it in this guess.

We can also try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we test candidate B.

For example, ""BONES"": 
  B O N E S

If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
  B: absent -> x
  O: ✓
  N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
  E: ✓
  S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not the absent letters. Then we can try ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to distinguish?

We can try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put a letter in position 3.

But we don't have many options.

We can try ""BONES"" now.

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only one left.

And N must be in 1 or 3.

So the word is either:
Option A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3)
Option B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1)

We can try to guess ""BONES"".

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

But we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to tell?

If we guess ""BONES"":
  If the word is ""BONES"", we win.

  If the word is ""NOLES"", then:
    B: absent -> x
    O: ✓
    N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)
    E: ✓
    S: ✓

So feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)

Then we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not absent. Then we can guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more. But we are on the fifth guess, so after this, one more if needed.

But we can do that.

But we might be able to guess the word.

We can also try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put N in position 3? But we are putting N in position 3? Then position 1 is the new letter.

But we don't have a word: ""BONES"" is not a word, and ""SONES"" has S in position 1 which is forbidden.

So I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a good word.

Alternatively, we can try to guess ""NOLES"".

But let's think: we have to make a choice.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in the second guess, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is the only position left for N.

Similarly, S must be in 5.

So I think ""BONES"" is a solid guess.

But let's check the feedback from guess 4: we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is not in 1 and not in 3, so 5 is the only possibility.

Similarly, N not in 2 or 4, so 1 or 3.

But if we put N in position 1 and S in position 5, then we have position 3 to fill.

We can try ""NOLES"".

But I think ""BONES"" is fine.

But we have to avoid using absent letters. D is absent, so ""SONED"" is out.

Now, if we guess ""BONES"", what if the word is ""NOLES""? Then we get the feedback as above.

But we can then guess ""NOLES"" next.

But we have two guesses left, so it's okay.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have position 1 and 3: one is the new letter, and the other is not S? But we need S in 5.

So we cannot test both at once.

Therefore, I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""BONES"".

But let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don't have a word.

Or a word that has N in position 3? But then we don't test position 1 for N.

We have to choose one.

I think ""BONES"" is the best.

So, fourth guess: ""BONES""

But let's write it.

But we must not use absent letters. B is not in the absent list, so it's okay.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BONES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.
- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.

### Key Insights:
- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.
- **O** is fixed in **position 2** (confirmed by Guess 4).
- **S** must be in **position 5** because:
  - S is present (from Guess 2 and 4).
  - S cannot be in position 1 (Guess 4: S in position 1 → '-') or 3 (Guess 2: S in position 3 → '-').
  - Positions 2 and 4 are occupied by O and E, so S must be in 5.
- **N** must be in **position 1 or 3**:
  - N is present (from all guesses) but cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2), 4 (Guess 1), or 3 (Guess 4). Thus, N must be in 1 or 3.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D (cannot appear).
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).

### Deduced Word Structure:
The secret word must be of the form:
- **Position 1**: N (if not, then position 3 must be N) 
- **Position 2**: O (fixed)
- **Position 3**: ? (if N is in 1, then position 3 is a new letter; if N is in 3, then position 1 is a new letter)
- **Position 4**: E (fixed)
- **Position 5**: S (deduced)

Thus, two candidate word patterns:
1. **N O ? E S** (e.g., ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"")
2. **? O N E S** (e.g., ""BONES"" is invalid because S cannot be in position 1, so this is only if N is in position 3)

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Test **BONES** to resolve the ambiguity between the two patterns:
  - If correct, we solve the word.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOLES** (since ""NOLES"" is the only other common word fitting pattern 1).

**Why BONES?**
- Tests **N in position 1** (if correct, we confirm; if not, N must be in position 3).
- Tests **S in position 5** (already deduced, but we need to confirm the fifth letter).
- Uses **B** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 1 to probe for the missing letter.

This guess will either:
- Confirm the word (if N in 1 and S in 5 are correct).
- Reveal that N must be in position 3 (and the word is ? O N E S) if N is marked as present but wrong position (while S is correct in position 5).

Actually, in our first guess, we had N in position 4 and it was wrong position. But note: the feedback for N was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 4. So we can try N in other positions.\n\n But wait: in ""LINED"", N is in position 3 and E is in position 4. However, we know that E cannot be in position 5? That\'s correct. But also, we are not sure about the positions.\n\n However, we must avoid using C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s check: L, I, N, E, D -> none of these are C, R, A. So it\'s okay.\n\n But note: we have to consider the positions. We know that N cannot be in position 4 (from the first guess) but that doesn\'t mean we can\'t put N in position 3? Actually, we can.\n\n However, we also know that E is in the word and cannot be in position 5. In ""LINED"", E is in position 4? That\'s allowed because the feedback only said E is not in position 5.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not in position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about position 4. So E can be in position 4.\n\n Similarly, N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but not 4).\n\n So ""LINED"" is a candidate.\n\n However, we want to test new letters. Let\'s see: we have L, I, D as new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that puts N and E in different positions.\n\n Another idea: since we know two letters (N and E) and we have three more to guess, we can try to use a word that has N and E and three new common letters.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A.\n\n Some words: \n - ""SINEW"": S, I, N, E, W -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? \n   But note: we cannot put N in position 4? Actually, in this word, N is in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4, but it might be in position 3? Yes.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5, so position 4 is allowed.\n\n But wait: what if the word has two N\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one N (and it was in the wrong position). However, it\'s possible that there is another N? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates unless we guess duplicates. Since we only had one N in ""crane"", and it was marked as present, it might be only one N. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\n However, the feedback for the first guess: we had one N and it was marked as present. So if the word has two N\'s, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: the feedback only marks each letter that is present. If there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might mark one as present and the other as absent? But in this case, we only had one N in the guess and it was marked as present. So the word has at least one N.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. However, if the word had two N\'s, then when we guess one N and it is in the wrong position, we would still get one \'-\' for that N. But if we guess a word with two N\'s, then both would be marked accordingly.\n\n Since we don\'t have information about duplicates, we can assume that the word has at least one N and one E.\n\n Now, let\'s consider ""SINEW"": \n   S (new), I (new), N (we know it\'s present, but in position 3?), E (we know it\'s present, in position 4?), W (new).\n\n But note: we are not sure if N is in position 3 or E in position 4. We are testing.\n\n However, we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it\'s wrong? We don\'t have that information for N and E yet.\n\n Another candidate: ""STONE"": \n   S, T, O, N, E -> N is in position 4? But wait, we know N is not in position 4 (from the first guess). So we cannot put N in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not correct so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting N in position 4 because we already know it\'s not there.\n\n In ""STONE"", N is in position 4 -> we know that\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t use that.\n\n How about ""STONE"" with N moved? We can\'t move it because it\'s fixed.\n\n Alternatively, ""ENTIA"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word).\n\n We must avoid A.\n\n Another word: ""MELON"" -> M, E, L, O, N -> \n   E is in position 2? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. So if we put E in position 2 and N in position 5, that\'s okay.\n\n However, we are not sure about the positions.\n\n But we also have to avoid C, R, A.\n\n ""MELON"" doesn\'t have them.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E and N and also includes other common letters like S, T, L.\n\n Let me list some words that have E and N and avoid C, R, A:\n\n - ""MINES"": M, I, N, E, S -> N is in position 3, E in position 4? \n   But note: we know E is not in position 5? That\'s correct. However, we are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n - ""LINEN"": L, I, N, E, N -> \n   This has two N\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two N\'s. Also, we are putting N in position 3 and 5. We know N is not in position 4, but we don\'t know about position 3 and 5.\n\n   However, we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n - ""BONES"": B, O, N, E, S -> N in position 3, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E. We know they are not in the positions we tried before? Actually, we only know they are not in position 4 for N and not in position 5 for E.\n\n We can try to put N in a new position and E in a new position.\n\n Let me try to put N in position 1,2,3, or 5? But we know it\'s not in 4. Similarly for E: not in 5.\n\n We can try:\n\n Option 1: N in position 1, E in position 2? \n   Example: ""NEEDS"" -> but we have two E\'s? and D and S. But note: we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was present. So if the word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks? But we don\'t know.\n\n However, we are trying to get information. Also, ""NEEDS"" has two E\'s and we are using E twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Option 2: N in position 2, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""ENVOY"" -> but V and Y are less common.\n\n Option 3: N in position 3, E in position 1? \n   Example: ""INLET"" -> I, N, L, E, T -> \n      I: new, N: we know it\'s present, L: new, E: we know it\'s present, T: new.\n\n This seems good because we are testing N in position 3 and E in position 4? But wait: in ""INLET"", \n   N is in position 3 and E is in position 4? \n\n But note: we know that N is not in position 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new. Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are putting E in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\n However, we are putting N in position 3 and E in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Another candidate: ""ONSET"" -> O, N, S, E, T -> \n   N is in position 2, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we are avoiding C, R, A.\n\n I think ""ONSET"" is a good candidate because:\n   O: new\n   N: in position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before)\n   S: new\n   E: in position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E before)\n   T: new\n\n This way, we are testing N in a new position (2) and E in a new position (4).\n\n Also, we are introducing three new letters: O, S, T.\n\n Let me check if ""ONSET"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use both N and E in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.\n\n Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have both N and E? But that would be inefficient because we know they are in the word. We should try to find the positions.\n\n So, I think ""ONSET"" is a good choice.\n\n However, what if the word has O, S, T? We don\'t know. We are testing.\n\n Let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""STEIN"" -> S, T, E, I, N -> \n   E is in position 3? and N in position 5? \n   But note: we are putting E in position 3? and N in position 5? \n\n This also avoids C, R, A.\n\n But we are putting E in position 3? We don\'t know if that\'s correct. And N in position 5? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we are testing new positions.\n\n But note: we have to avoid using the same letter in the same position that we know is wrong? We don\'t have a correct position for N and E yet.\n\n I think both ""ONSET"" and ""STEIN"" are good.\n\n Let me choose ""ONSET"" because it has N in position 2 and E in position 4, which are new positions.\n\n So, I\'ll go with ""ONSET"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not using any duplicate in this guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put N and E in the same positions as each other? Actually, we are putting them in different positions.\n\n Let me confirm: \n   In ""ONSET"": \n      Position 1: O (new)\n      Position 2: N (we know N is present, and we are trying position 2)\n      Position 3: S (new)\n      Position 4: E (we know E is present, and we are trying position 4)\n      Position 5: T (new)\n\n This is a valid word.\n\n So, I\'ll guess ""ONSET"".\n\n But note: we must not use the same position for N and E that we know is wrong? We are not using position 4 for N (we are using position 2) and position 5 for E (we are using position 4). So that\'s okay.\n\n Let me write the guess: ONSET.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess told us that N is not in position 4. But we are not using position 4 for N? We are using position 2. So that\'s fine.\n\n Similarly, E is not in position 5? We are using position 4. So that\'s fine.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""ONSET"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and A are **not** in the secret word.\n- N is in the word but **not in position 4**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the second guess, I need a word that:\n1. Includes **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n2. Excludes C, R, A (since they are absent).\n3. Avoids placing N in position 4 or E in position 5 (since those positions are incorrect).\n4. Maximizes new information by testing common letters like S, T, and O.\n\nThe word **ONSET** fits these criteria:\n- Contains **N** (position 2) and **E** (position 4).\n- Uses new letters: **O, S, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A) and positions (N in position 4, E in position 5).\n\nThis tests new positions for N and E while probing three additional common letters.\n\n<guess>onset</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n- N is in the word but not in position 4.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""onset"" -> Feedback: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nMeaning:\n- O is in the word but not in position 1.\n- N is in the word but not in position 2 (since we put it in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- S is in the word but not in position 3.\n- E is in the word and in the correct position! So E is the 4th letter (position 4).\n- T is not in the word.\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- E is in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the second guess).\n\nPresent letters (but not necessarily in the correct position):\n- N is in the word, but not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess).\n- O is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).\n- S is in the word, but not in position 3 (from second guess).\n\nAbsent letters:\n- C, R, A, T (from both guesses: C, R, A, T are not in the word)\n- Also, from the first guess, we know that the word does not contain the letters C, R, A. From the second guess, we know that T is not in the word.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters.\n\nNow, let\'s list what we know:\n\nPosition 4 is E.\n\nThe word has N, O, S, and E (and one more letter we don\'t know yet).\n\nSince N is present but not in position 2 or 4, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, O is present but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nS is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 4 is E.\n\nSo the word structure: \nPosition 1: ? \nPosition 2: ? \nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: E \nPosition 5: ?\n\nAnd the letters we know are in the word: N, O, S, E (and one more letter, which we don\'t know).\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, T.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits:\n\n- Has E in position 4.\n- Contains N, O, S (and one more letter).\n- The missing letter cannot be C, R, A, T.\n\nWe also have constraints on the positions for N, O, S:\n\n- N: not in 2 or 4 -> so in 1, 3, or 5.\n- O: not in 1 -> so in 2, 3, or 5.\n- S: not in 3 -> so in 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: if N is in position 1, then O and S cannot be in position 1? But position 1 can only have one letter. So if N is in 1, then O and S must be in 2,3,5 but also we have to place O and S without conflict.\n\nSimilarly, if N is in 3, then position 1 and 2 and 5 are available for O and S.\n\nIf N is in 5, then position 1,2,3 for O and S.\n\nWe also need to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We want to test possible positions for N, O, S and also discover the fifth letter.\n\nWe know the fifth letter must be a letter that is not C, R, A, T, and not E (since E is already in position 4), and not N, O, S? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates yet.\n\nWe have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But the feedback so far doesn\'t show duplicates. For example, in ""onset"", we had one O, one N, one S, and one E. The feedback for O, N, S were all present (but wrong positions) and E was correct. So if there were duplicates, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks each letter once? Actually, if a letter appears twice, it might be marked accordingly. But in this case, we only guessed one of each, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should not assume duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nSo, let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe have four known letters: N, O, S, E. But the word has five letters, so one more letter we don\'t know.\n\nWe need to find a word that has E in position 4, and contains N, O, S, and one new letter (not C, R, A, T).\n\nWe also have position constraints:\n\n- N: not 2,4 -> so positions: 1,3,5\n- O: not 1 -> positions: 2,3,5\n- S: not 3 -> positions: 1,2,5\n\nBut note: we cannot have two letters in the same position.\n\nWe can try to form words:\n\nCase 1: N in position 1.\nThen the word: N _ _ E _\nO can be in 2,3,5; S in 2,3,5 (but if O is in 2, then S can\'t be in 2, etc.).\n\nPossible words:\n- N O _ E S? But S can be in 5. But what can be in position 3? It must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T and not N,O,S,E (but E is already in 4, and we are using it only once? assuming no duplicates). So position 3 can be a new letter.\n\nBut we need a valid word: ""NOXES""? But X is not common. ""NOISE""? But I is a vowel, and we have E already. ""NOISE"" has E in position 5? But we need E in position 4. So ""NOISE"" is N O I S E -> positions: N(1), O(2), I(3), S(4), E(5) -> but we need E in 4, so not.\n\nWe need E in position 4. So the word pattern: N ? ? E ?\n\nWith O and S in the remaining positions (2,3,5) but not in the same positions as each other.\n\nExample: ""NOSE?"" -> but we need 5 letters. ""NOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nPossible: ""NOISE"" is 5 letters but E is in position 5, not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: N ? ? E ?\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""NOMEN""? But M and E: N O M E N -> but we have two N\'s? And E in position 4? \n  N(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), N(5). \n  But we have N in position 1 and 5. We know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated. Also, O is in position 2, which is allowed (since O not in 1, and 2 is new). \n  But we have S? We must have S in the word. ""NOMEN"" does not have S. So invalid.\n\nWe must have S in the word.\n\nSo: N ? ? E ? and we need to include S.\n\nHow about ""NOISE""? But E is at the end. Not.\n\n""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It would be N O S E Y -> E is in position 4? \n  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: Y.\n  This fits: N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed, since O not in 1, and 2 is new), S in 3? But wait, we know S is not in position 3? From the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position? Actually, in ""onset"", S was in position 3 and we got S(-) meaning S is in the word but not in position 3. So S cannot be in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in ""NOSEY"", S is in position 3, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.\n\nAnother word: ""NOSER""? But R is not allowed (we know R is absent). R is in the absent list.\n\n""Noses""? But that\'s 5 letters: N O S E S -> but E is in position 4? \n  N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S is in position 3 and 5. We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess). Also, we have two S\'s? The feedback for ""onset"" had only one S and it was marked present, so if the word has two S\'s, that\'s possible? But we don\'t know. However, we are trying to avoid known absent letters.\n\nBut R is absent, so ""Noses"" has R? No, ""Noses"" is N-O-S-E-S, so no R. But we have S twice? And we know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated.\n\nBut we are trying to guess, so let\'s consider.\n\nHowever, we are constrained: we cannot use R, C, A, T.\n\nAnother word: ""NOSEY"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nWhat about ""NOBLE""? But B and L are new. But E is in position 4? \n  N O B L E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: the word must end with E? No, position 4 is E, so the word is ? ? ? E ?\n\nWith N, O, S, and one more letter.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""NOISE"": N O I S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\n- ""NOSE"": 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters with E in the fourth.\n\nExamples:\n- ""NOMEN"": as above, but it has two N\'s and no S. So no.\n- ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but E is in position 4? \n  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This has S in position 1 and 5, and N in position 3. \n  But we know S is not in position 3? That\'s not a problem. \n  However, we have O in position 2 (allowed) and S in position 1 and 5. \n  But we don\'t have a constraint against S in position 1 or 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3.\n\nBut wait: in the second guess, we had S in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S is in the word but not in position 3. It can be in 1,2,5.\n\nSo ""SONES"" is a candidate? But it has two S\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nBut we are trying to guess. Also, ""SONES"" is a word (meaning: a type of wave or plural of son).\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, N in position 3.\n\nBut we know from the second guess that N is not in position 2 (we put it in position 2 and got \'-\', so it\'s not there) and not in 4 (from first guess). But position 3 is new for N. Similarly, O is in position 2 (we haven\'t tried that).\n\nBut we also know that O is not in position 1 (tried in ""onset"") and S is not in position 3 (tried in ""onset"").\n\nIn ""SONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and O in position 2 (allowed). S is in position 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying to test the position of N, O, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat letters and uses a new letter.\n\nBut we have to include all of N, O, S and E? Actually, we know E is in position 4, so we must have E there.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has E in position 4, and includes N, O, S, and one new letter (not C,R,A,T).\n\nLet me think of words ending with ""E"" and having N, O, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""SONES"" as above.\n- ""SONIC"": but C is absent (from first guess: C(x)), so no.\n- ""SONLY""? Not a word.\n- ""SONES"" is a word.\n\nAnother: ""NOISE"" doesn\'t have E in position 4.\n\nWhat about ""HOUSE""? But H is new, and E is in position 4? \n  H O U S E -> E is in position 5, not 4.\n\n""HOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""NOSE"" is 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\n""NOBLE"" has E in position 5.\n\n""NOSEY"" has E in position 5.\n\nWhat about ""NOSED""? But that\'s 5 letters? N O S E D -> E is in position 4? \n  Position 1: N, 2: O, 3: S, 4: E, 5: D.\n  This fits: E in position 4.\n\nBut is ""NOSED"" a word? It is the past tense of nodde? Not common. ""Nosed"" is not a standard word. \n\n""NOSED"" might be accepted? But let\'s look for better.\n\n""POSED"": P O S E D -> E in position 4? \n  P(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), D(5). \n  But S is in position 3? We know S is not in position 3 (from second guess: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong position, so S cannot be in position 3). Therefore, ""POSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""NOSED"" is invalid because S is in position 3.\n\nWhat about ""NOSE""? 4 letters.\n\nWe need to avoid S in position 3.\n\nSo let\'s try to put S in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nCase: S in position 1.\nThen: S ? ? E ?\nAnd O must be in 2,3,5 (but not 1) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so N can be in 3 or 5, and O in 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nExample: ""S O ? E ?"" -> but we need a word.\n\n""S O L E D""? ""Soled"" is not a common word.\n\n""S O F T E""? But T is absent.\n\n""S O U P E""? ""Soupe"" is a word? But E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: S ? ? E ?\n\nPossible: ""S N O E ?"" -> but N must be in 3 or 5.\n\nIf N in 3: ""S ? N E ?"" -> then O must be in 2 or 5? But position 2: ?, position 5: ?\n\nExample: ""S O N E S"" -> but we have two S\'s? And O in position 2? \n  S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S in position 1 and 5? And O in position 2. \n  But we know S is not in position 3? That\'s fine. \n  But we have two S\'s? The word ""SONES"" is valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. We can try it.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get: if we guess ""SONES"", we are testing:\n- S in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x or -.\n- Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut we are also testing the new letter S in position 5? Actually, we are testing two S\'s.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a new letter and places N, O, S in new positions.\n\nBut we have to include all of N, O, S and E.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to put N in position 3, O in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need a word.\n\nWord: ""N O ? E S"" -> with a letter in position 3.\n\nExample: ""N O K E S""? ""Nokes"" is a word? Or ""Nokes""? Not common.\n\n""N O P E S""? ""Nopes"" is a word (meaning: not possible).\n\n""N O S E ?"" but we need 5 letters: ""NOSE"" is 4.\n\nWe need to use a new letter in position 3.\n\nHow about ""NOSEY""? But E is not in position 4? It ends with Y.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nAnother: ""NOSED"" is not standard.\n\n""POSED"" has S in position 3.\n\nLet me try S in position 2.\n\nCase: S in position 2.\nThen: ? S ? E ?\n\nAnd O must be in 1,3,5 (but not 2, because S is there) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1,3,5).\n\nExample: ""I S ? E ?"" -> but we need to fill.\n\n""I S L E S""? ""Isles"" -> E in position 4? \n  I(1), S(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n  But S is in position 2 and 5. \n  And O? We don\'t have O in this word. But we know O is in the word! So we must have O.\n\nSo we cannot skip O.\n\nWe must have all of N, O, S, E.\n\nSo if S is in position 2, then we have: ? S ? E ?\n\nWe need O and N in the remaining positions.\n\nExample: ""O S ? E ?"" -> but O is in position 1? And we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong position, so O cannot be in position 1).\n\nSo O cannot be in position 1.\n\nTherefore, if S is in position 2, then O can be in position 3 or 5.\n\nAnd N can be in position 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4).\n\nSo possibilities:\n- O in position 3: then word: ? S O E ? \n  And N must be in 1 or 5? (since 3 is taken by O).\n\nIf N in 1: ""N S O E ?"" -> what can be in position 5? \n  ""N S O E D"" -> ""NSOED"" is not a word.\n\n""NSOE"" is not a word.\n\nIf N in 5: "" ? S O E N"" -> then position 1: ?, position 5: N.\n  Example: ""I S O E N"" -> ""Isoen"" is not a word.\n\n""USONE""? Not a word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nCase: S in position 5.\nThen: ? ? ? E S\n\nO must be in 1,2,3 (but not 1, so 2 or 3) and N in 1,3,5 (but not 2 or 4, so 1 or 3).\n\nIf O in 2: then word: ? O ? E S\nN can be in 1 or 3.\n\nExample: ""N O ? E S"" -> ""NOLES""? ""Noles"" is a word (meaning: a bone of an animal). \n  N(1), O(2), L(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This fits: \n    - E in position 4: good.\n    - N in position 1: we haven\'t tried position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.\n    - O in position 2: we haven\'t tried position 2 for O? We know O is not in 1, so 2 is new.\n    - S in position 5: we know S is not in 3, so 5 is new.\n\n  And L is a new letter.\n\n  Also, we avoid C,R,A,T.\n\n  So ""NOLES"" is a candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to check if it meets the position constraints for each letter:\n\n- N: position 1 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n- O: position 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n- L: new letter, position 3.\n- E: position 4 (correct)\n- S: position 5 (not 3 -> valid)\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut is ""NOLES"" a valid word? Yes, it means a bone or a shoelace.\n\nAnother possibility: S in position 5 and N in position 3: then word: ? ? N E S\nO must be in 1,2,3 but 3 is taken by N? So O in 1 or 2.\n\nIf O in 1: ""O ? N E S"" -> but O in position 1? But we know O is not in position 1 (from second guess: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O cannot be in 1). So invalid.\n\nIf O in 2: "" ? O N E S"" -> then position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: N, position 4: E, position 5: S.\n  Example: ""B O N E S"" -> ""Bones"" is a word! \n    B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This also fits the constraints:\n    - N: in position 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n    - O: in position 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n    - S: in position 5 (not 3 -> valid)\n  And B is new.\n\nBut note: in ""BONES"", we have O in position 2 and N in position 3. We haven\'t tried O in position 2 or N in position 3 before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 2 (wrong) and position 4 (we know not 4). So position 3 for N is new.\n\nSimilarly, S in position 5 is new.\n\nSo ""BONES"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we already have two candidates: ""NOLES"" and ""BONES"".\n\nWe also have the constraint that N cannot be in position 2 or 4, so in ""BONES"", N is in position 3 (which is allowed) and S in position 5 (allowed, since S not in 3).\n\nIn ""NOLES"", N is in position 1 and S in position 5.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also need to consider that we are testing the position of O.\n\nIn ""BONES"": \n  O is in position 2? We haven\'t tried position 2 for O before? We tried O in position 1 (wrong) and position 4? We don\'t have feedback for position 4? We know position 4 is E, so we don\'t test O there. But we haven\'t tested O in position 2 or 3 or 5.\n\nIn ""NOLES"":\n  O is in position 2? Same as above.\n\nBut in ""BONES"", we are testing O in position 2 and N in position 3 and S in position 5.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are testing a new letter: in ""BONES"" it\'s B, in ""NOLES"" it\'s L.\n\nBoth are common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using letters we know are absent. We don\'t know about B or L.\n\nAnother candidate: what if we put N in position 5? Then S in position 1? And O in position 2? \n\nWord: ""S O ? E N"" -> with a letter in position 3.\n\n""S O L E N""? ""Solen"" is not a common word.\n\n""S O P E N""? ""Sopren"" not a word.\n\n""S O U E N""? ""Souen"" not a word.\n\nSo ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"" are the main candidates.\n\nWe can also consider putting N in position 3 and S in position 1.\n\nWord: ""S ? N E ?"" -> with O in 2 or 5? But if S in 1, then position 1 is S, then O in 2: ""S O N E ?"" -> then position 5: ?\n  ""S O N E D"" -> ""SONED"" is a word (past tense of soned? meaning made hard like sones). \n  But E is in position 4? Yes: S(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), D(5). \n  This also fits: \n    - N: in 3 (not 2 or 4 -> valid)\n    - O: in 2 (not 1 -> valid)\n    - S: in 1 (not 3 -> valid) -> but we know S is not in position 3, but position 1 is new.\n  And D is new.\n\n  So ""SONED"" is a candidate.\n\nNow we have three candidates: \n1. ""NOLES"" (N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5)\n2. ""BONES"" (B in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, S in 5)\n3. ""SONED"" (S in 1, O in 2, N in 3, E in 4, D in 5)\n\nWe can choose one that tests new positions.\n\nBut note: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nIn ""NOLES"", we are putting N in position 1 and O in position 2.\n\nWe know that N is not in position 2 or 4, so position 1 is a candidate. Similarly, O not in 1, so position 2 is a candidate.\n\nBut we also want to test if S can be in position 5? We know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, in ""BONES"", we test O in position 2 and N in position 3.\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut note: we are also testing D.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3 or 5.\n\nBut let\'s see.\n\nIf we put O in position 3: \n  Then the word: ? ? O E ?\n\nAnd we need to place N and S.\n\nFor example, "" ? ? O E N"" -> then N must be in 1 or 5? (since not 2,4).\n\nIf N in 1: ""N ? O E N"" -> but we have two N\'s? Or ""N O O E N"" -> duplicate O? Not good.\n\nIf N in 5: "" ? ? O E N"" -> then position 1 and 2: two new letters.\n\nExample: ""I S O E N"" -> not a word.\n\n""US O E N"" not.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nPut O in position 5: \n  Then: ? ? ? E O\n\nAnd we need to place N and S.\n\nN can be in 1,3 (since not 2,4).\n\nS can be in 1,2,3.\n\nExample: ""S ? ? E O"" -> with N in 1 or 3.\n\nIf N in 1: ""S ? ? E O"" -> then position 2 and 3: two new letters.\n\nExample: ""S H I E O"" -> ""Shieo"" not a word.\n\n""S C H E O"" -> C is absent.\n\nNot working.\n\nIf N in 3: "" ? ? N E O"" -> then position 1 and 2: new letters.\n\nExample: ""D U N E O"" -> ""Duno"" not a word.\n\n""B U N E O"" -> not a word.\n\nSo it\'s difficult to form a word with O in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the best candidates are ""SONED"", ""BONES"", ""NOLES"".\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, it uses D, which is a common letter.\n\nBut note: we are testing S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in position 1,2,5. So testing position 1 for S is good.\n\nSimilarly, O in position 2 is good.\n\nWe also test D.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SONED"".\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback we would get if the word is, say, ""BONES""? But we don\'t know.\n\nWe are trying to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put O in position 2? For example, put O in position 3.\n\nBut we need a word: "" ? ? N O E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\n"" ? ? O N E"" -> but then E is in position 5? Not 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo: "" ? ? O E ?"" -> but then we need to put N somewhere.\n\n"" ? ? O E N"" -> then N in position 5? \n  Example: ""D I O E N"" -> ""Dien"" is 4 letters? ""Diones"" is 6.\n\n""POESY""? But E is in position 3? Not 4.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NOSEY"" but E is at the end.\n\nI think ""SONED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses a vowel for the new letter? We have used O and E, and consonants C,R,A,T are out. So we have many vowels left: I, U, etc.\n\nBut in ""SONED"", we use D, which is a consonant.\n\nWe can try ""SONIC"" but C is absent.\n\n""SONLY"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""SONED"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut wait: in ""SONED"", we are putting S in position 1. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s in 1. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a dash or an x? But we know S is present, so if it\'s not in 1, we get a dash for S in position 1? But we already know S is present, so if we get a dash for S in position 1, that would mean S is in the word but not in position 1, which we already know? But it doesn\'t give new information? Actually, it confirms S is not in 1, but we already know S is not in 1.\n\nSo it\'s okay, but we are testing position 1 for S.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing position 2 for O.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried in a different position.\n\nWe have also not tried position 3 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so position 3 is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 for N? We haven\'t tried.\n\nBut in ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""NOLES"", which tests N in 1, O in 2, and S in 5.\n\nI think both are good.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for N.\n\nIn ""SONED"", we are testing S in 1 and O in 2, and N in 3? Actually, in ""SONED"": \n  Position 1: S\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: N\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: D\n\nSo we are testing N in position 3.\n\nIn ""NOLES"": \n  Position 1: N\n  Position 2: O\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: E\n  Position 5: S\n\nSo we are testing S in position 5.\n\nWe know S is not in position 3, so position 5 is a candidate.\n\nI think both test new positions.\n\nBut we also want to cover the possibility of N in position 3 or 5.\n\nIn ""SONED"", we are testing N in position 3.\n\nIn ""BONES"", we are testing N in position 3 and S in position 5.\n\nBut ""BONES"" has O in position 2.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""SONED"" because it tests S in position 1 and O in position 2, which are adjacent positions.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""SONED"".\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters. D is not in the absent list, so it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, my third guess is ""SONED"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have.\n\nWe know:\n- E is in position 4.\n- The word has N, O, S, E, and one more letter (which is D in this guess).\n\nWe are testing:\n- S in position 1: if it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - (since we know S is present) and then we know S is not in 1.\n- O in position 2: similarly, if not correct, we get -.\n- N in position 3: if not correct, we get -.\n- E in position 4: we know it\'s correct, so ✓.\n- D in position 5: we are testing a new letter.\n\nThis will give us more information.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""SONED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A are absent; N and E are present but not in positions 4 or 5, respectively.\n- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S are present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3, respectively; E is correct in position 4; T is absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E is fixed in position 4**.\n- **Present letters**: N, O, S (must appear in the word, but not in the positions tested).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T (cannot appear in the word).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - N: Not in positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3, or 5.\n  - O: Not in position 1 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.\n  - S: Not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, or 5.\n- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, and not E, N, O, S (assuming no duplicates for now).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test new positions for N, O, S to narrow down possibilities.\n- Introduce a common consonant (D) as the fifth letter to probe for its presence.\n- **Chosen word: ""SONED""** (past tense of ""sone"", meaning a sound or a bone).\n  - S in position 1 (tests if S is in position 1, which is a candidate position).\n  - O in position 2 (tests if O is in position 2, which is a candidate position).\n  - N in position 3 (tests if N is in position 3, which is a candidate position).\n  - E in position 4 (confirmed correct, so ✓ is expected).\n  - D in position 5 (probes for the fifth letter).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests the constraints while exploring new positions for the known letters.\n\n<guess>soned</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: soned -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the fourth guess ""soned"":\n  S: - (present but wrong position)\n  O: ✓ (correct position)\n  N: - (present but wrong position)\n  E: ✓ (correct position)\n  D: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from all feedback:\n\nConfirmed:\n- Position 4 is E (from guess 2 and now confirmed again).\n- O is in the word and in position 2 (now confirmed by guess 4).\n- E is in position 4 (already known).\n\nAdditionally:\n- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- N is in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 4: N in position 3 got \'-\') and not in position 2 or 4 (from guess 1).\n\nWe also know:\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, T, D (from absent letters in guesses 1,2,4).\n\nNow, let\'s summarize:\n\n- Position 2 is O (confirmed by guess 4).\n- Position 4 is E (confirmed in both).\n- S is present, but not in position 1 (from guess 4) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because positions 1 and 3 are ruled out, and position 2 is O and 4 is E, so the only position left for S is 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nPositions:\n1: unknown, but S cannot be here (from guess 4: S in position 1 got \'-\')\n2: O (confirmed)\n3: unknown, but N cannot be here (from guess 4: N in position 3 got \'-\') and S cannot be here (from guess 2: S in position 3 got \'-\')\n4: E (confirmed)\n5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only possibility? But what about position 1? We haven\'t tested S in position 1? Actually, in guess 4, we put S in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S cannot be in 1. Similarly, not in 3. And 2 and 4 are taken by O and E. So S must be in position 5.\n\nBut wait: the word has 5 positions. We know:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and the only position left is 5? But we also have to place N? \n\nWe know N is present and must be in one of the positions: 1,3. Because:\n- Not in 2 (occupied by O)\n- Not in 4 (occupied by E)\n- Not in 1? We haven\'t tested N in position 1? Actually, we haven\'t. But we know N is not in position 2 (from guess 2: N in position 2 got \'-\') and not in 4 (from guess 1). So N must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nBut position 5 is now going to be S? So if position 5 is S, then position 1 must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and 5 is taken by S.\n\nSo the word would be: \nPosition 1: N? \nPosition 2: O\nPosition 3: ? \nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: S\n\nBut we know N is present and must be in 1 or 3. If position 1 is N, then position 3 is something else. If position 1 is not N, then position 1 must be a new letter, and N in position 3.\n\nBut we also have S to place. If S is in position 5, then position 1 must be N? Because N and S must be placed, and position 1 is the only one left for N if it\'s not in 3? But we have two letters to place: N and S, and one more letter? Actually, we have three positions to fill: 1, 3, and 5? But we have two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? Because we have positions 1,3,5 to fill with N, S, and one new letter? But we have three positions and two known letters? Actually, we have three positions (1,3,5) and two known letters (N and S) and one unknown letter? But we know the word has exactly five letters, and we have O, E, and two others: N and S, and one more.\n\nBut we have O and E already, and N and S are coming. So the word has O, E, N, S, and one more.\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] O [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nConstraints:\n- letter1: must be N? Because N must be in 1 or 3, and if letter1 is not N, then N must be in 3, and then letter1 is something else, and letter5 must be S? Because S must be in 5? But what if N is in 3 and S is in 5? Then letter1 must be a new letter.\n\nBut we know S is present and must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,3,5? But position 1: we haven\'t tested S there, but we know S is not in 1 (from guess 4). Position 3: we haven\'t tested S there. But we know S is not in position 3 (from guess 2). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and position 1 is not allowed for S.\n\nBut position 5: we haven\'t tested S there. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut also, N must be in 1 or 3.\n\nSo the possibilities:\nOption A: N in 1, then S in 5, and then position 3 is a new letter? But we have to fill position 3 and 5? Actually, we have position 3 and 5 to fill, but we have two letters: N and S, and one more.\n\nSo the word: N O ? E S\n\nBut we know that position 3 must be a letter that is not C,R,A,T,D (absent letters) and not N,O,S,E (if no duplicates). But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo position 3 must be a new letter, say X.\n\nThen the word is ""NOXES""? But X is a letter.\n\nBut is ""NOXES"" a word? Yes, meaning a type of bomb or plural of noxius.\n\nBut let\'s check the constraints for N: \n  N in position 1: we haven\'t tested position 1 for N? We know N is not in 2 or 4, so 1 is possible.\n\nBut we also have to check for S: in position 5? We know S is not in 1 or 3, so 5 is possible.\n\nBut what about position 3? We are putting X there.\n\nBut we know S is present, and if we put it in 5, then position 3 must be X.\n\nBut we also have to ensure that N is in 1: we haven\'t tested N in position 1, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we also have to consider: in guess 1, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in guess 2, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is new.\n\nSimilarly, for S: we had S in position 3 (wrong) and in guess 4, we had S in position 1 (wrong). So position 5 is new.\n\nBut we are not sure if N can be in 1.\n\nAlternatively, N could be in position 3.\n\nIf N is in position 3, then the word: ? O N E ? \n\nBut we need to place S and one more letter.\n\nS cannot be in position 1 (known) and cannot be in position 3 (known). So S must be in position 5? Because position 2 and 4 are taken, and 1 is not allowed.\n\nSo if N is in 3, then S must be in 5, and position 1 is a new letter.\n\nThen the word: ? O N E S\n\nSo position 1: new letter, position 3: N, position 5: S.\n\nWe need a word: _ O N E S\n\nWhat letters can we use? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D.\n\nSo position 1: cannot be C,R,A,T,D, and must be a letter not used.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> but we have B? \n  But we haven\'t tested B. \n  However, in guess 4, we had D absent, but B is new.\n\nBut ""BONES"" is a word.\n\nBut we already have a candidate ""BONES"" from before? Actually, we didn\'t use it then.\n\nBut in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which has D, and D is absent, so ""BONES"" has no D, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut we also have ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> but if N is in position 1, then in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, but we are considering the case where N is in 3? No, in ""NOLES"", N is in 1, which is the same as the option A.\n\nBut if we are considering N in position 3, then ""NOLES"" would be: N O L E S -> N in 1, O in 2, L in 3, E in 4, S in 5. So that\'s option A.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that N is in position 3 and S in position 5.\n\nNow, what about the letter in position 3? In ""NOLES"", we use L.\n\nBut we also have ""BONES"" (B O N E S) which is the same as ""NOLES"" but with B.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B is in the word.\n\nBut we need to distinguish between the two cases.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that tests between these cases.\n\nBut we have to include the known letters: O, E, N, S, and one more.\n\nBut we know O, E, N, S are in the word, so we must include them.\n\nWe also know position 2 is O and position 4 is E.\n\nSo the word pattern: [pos1] O N E S\n\nBut we don\'t know if N is in position 1 or 3.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test if it\'s correctly placed.\n\nBut we are forced to put N in 1 or 3.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to put S in position 5? Then we have the word: N O ? E S\n\nWe need a letter for position 3 that forms a word.\n\nPossible letters: not C,R,A,T,D, and not O,N,E,S (if no duplicates). So we have many: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters.\n\n""NOXES"" (if we accept it) or ""NOLES"" (which is a word) or ""BONES"".\n\nBut we also have the possibility that N is in position 3, then the word is ? O N E S, and we need a letter for position 1.\n\nThen ""BONES"" is one.\n\nOther words: ""CONES"" but C is absent.\n\n""ONES"" is a word? Yes, but we have O in position 2, so ""ONES"" would be E in position 1? No, ""ONES"" is O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2: O in position 1 was marked as present but wrong, so O not in 1).\n\nSo position 1 cannot be O? It\'s fixed as O in position 2.\n\nSo for the pattern ? O N E S, position 1 must be a consonant? And ""BONES"" is one.\n\nBut we also have ""HONES""? Not a word.\n\n""PONES""? Not common.\n\n""MINES""? But M in position 1? And we have N in position 3? But ""MINES"" has M in 1, I in 3? But we need N in 3? So ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> N in position 3, but position 3 is N? Then O is in position 2? But we have O in position 2? In ""MINES"", position 2 is I? So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need position 2 to be O.\n\nSo the word must have O in position 2 and E in position 4, and then N in 1 or 3, and S in 5.\n\nSo the two main candidates are:\nCandidate A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3, and the word is ""NOXES"" or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"")\nCandidate B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1, and the word is ""BONES"" or similar)\n\nBut we don\'t know which.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nWe know that in candidate A, position 3 is a letter that is not in the absent list, and in candidate B, position 1 is a letter not in the absent list.\n\nWe also know that in candidate A, N is in position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and in candidate B, N is in position 3 (which we haven\'t tested).\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we also need to have S in position 5? Then we have to fill position 1 and 3.\n\nBut we can do that.\n\nHowever, we are constrained: we must have O, E, N, S in the word? Actually, we know they are in the word, so we must include them.\n\nBut we are not forced to put S in position 5? We know S must be in 5, but we can test it.\n\nBut we are trying to find the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also try to guess a word that doesn\'t assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include the known letters.\n\nBut we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S somewhere.\n\nGiven that S must be in 5, and N in 1 or 3, we can try to guess a word that puts N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? Then we can see if it\'s valid.\n\nBut we need to form a word: ""NO?ES"" -> with ? in position 3.\n\nPossible: ""NOXES"" (if we allow uncommon words) or ""NOLES"" or ""BONES"".\n\nBut let\'s see if we can guess a word that tests position 1 for N and position 3 for a new letter.\n\nBut we also need to test if S is in position 5? We know it must be, but we can confirm.\n\nBut we are allowed to guess any valid word.\n\nWe can guess ""BONES"": \n  B O N E S\n\nIf the word is ""BONES"", then we get:\n  B: ? \n  O: ✓ (position 2)\n  N: ? (if N is in position 3, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? Because we put N in position 3, but if the word has N in position 1, then we would get N as present but wrong position? But we know N is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it\'s actually in 1, we get \'-\' for N.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""BONES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then we get:\n  B: absent? Or if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent? So we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it\'s in 1), and S(✓) if S is in 5? But we know S is in 5, so it should be ✓.\n\nBut let\'s simulate:\n\nIf secret word is ""NOLES"":\n  B: not in word -> x\n  O: ✓ (position 2)\n  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, not 3) -> so N(-)\n  E: ✓ (position 4)\n  S: ✓ (position 5)\n\nSo feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n\nIf secret word is ""BONES"":\n  B: ✓ (if B is in position 1)\n  O: ✓\n  N: ✓ (if N is in position 3)\n  E: ✓\n  S: ✓\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe can use this to test.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we can test candidate B.\n\nBut we have to choose.\n\nWe can also try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can guess ""BONES"" to test.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 5? Let me see: we have made 4 guesses, so this is guess 5.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has N in position 1 and a new letter in position 3? But we need to form a valid word.\n\nBut we don\'t have many common words that fit the pattern without using absent letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.\n- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.\n- ""CONES"": C is absent -> invalid.\n- ""ONES"": O in position 1? But we know O cannot be in position 1. So invalid.\n- ""PONES"": not common, and P is new? But not standard.\n- ""MINES"": M in position 1? But then position 3 is I? But we need position 2 to be O, so ""MINES"" is M I N E S -> position 2 is I, not O -> invalid.\n\nSo only a few options: ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"" (if we allow), but ""NOXES"" is not very common.\n\n""NOLES"" is a word.\n\nBut we also have ""SONES"": S O N E S -> but then position 1 is S? But we know S cannot be in position 1 (from guess 4: S in position 1 got \'-\'). So ""SONES"" is invalid because S in position 1 is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""SONED"" we already tried and D is absent.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", and perhaps ""NOXES"".\n\nBut ""NOXES"" is not as common.\n\nWe can try ""BONES"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might be missing something.\n\nAnother candidate: what if the word has the letter in position 1? We haven\'t tested N in position 1.\n\nBut we have to guess.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that doesn\'t assume N in 1 or 3? But we have to include O, E, N, S.\n\nBut we know O and E are fixed, so we have to put N and S.\n\nWe can try to put N in position 1 and S in position 5, and a new letter in position 3: ""NO?ES"".\n\nBut we need a valid word: \n- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> valid.\n- ""BONES"": B O N E S -> valid.\n- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> valid, but less common.\n\nWe can choose ""BONES"" because B is a common letter.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had D at the end and D is absent, so the word doesn\'t have D.\n\nNow, if we guess ""BONES"", we are testing:\n  B in position 1: if B is in the word? And if it\'s in position 1?\n  O in position 2: we know it\'s correct, so ✓.\n  N in position 3: we know N is present, but if it\'s in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for N. But we know N is not in 2 or 4, so 3 is possible.\n  E in position 4: ✓.\n  S in position 5: we know S must be in 5, so it should be ✓.\n\nBut if the word is ""NOLES"", then B is absent, so we get B(x) and then O(✓), N(-) because N is in the word but not in position 3 (if it\'s in 1), and S(✓).\n\nBut we don\'t know if N is in 1 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.\n\nFor example, ""NOLES"": \n  N O L E S\n\nIf we guess ""NOLES"", and the secret word is ""BONES"", then:\n  N: in position 1? But in ""BONES"", N is in position 3, so N is present but not in 1 -> so N(-)\n  O: ✓\n  L: new, if L is in the word? But ""BONES"" has B, so L is absent -> L(x)\n  E: ✓\n  S: ✓\n\nSo feedback: N(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n\nBut we know N is present, so if we get N(-), that means N is not in position 1, so it must be in position 3? Because the only other option is position 3.\n\nThen we know the word is ? O N E S, and we have to find the first letter.\n\nThen we can guess ""BONES"" next.\n\nBut we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more.\n\nBut we can do that.\n\nBut we might be able to solve it in this guess.\n\nWe can also try to guess a word that has N in position 3? Then we test candidate B.\n\nFor example, ""BONES"": \n  B O N E S\n\nIf the word is ""NOLES"", then:\n  B: absent -> x\n  O: ✓\n  N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)\n  E: ✓\n  S: ✓\n\nSo feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n\nThen we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not the absent letters. Then we can try ""NOLES"" next.\n\nBut we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to distinguish?\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has N in position 1? Then we test candidate A.\n\nBut we don\'t have a good word for that.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put a letter in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe can try ""BONES"" now.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we have.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: must be S? Because S is present and cannot be in 1,3, so 5 is the only one left.\n\nAnd N must be in 1 or 3.\n\nSo the word is either:\nOption A: N O ? E S  (with ? in position 3)\nOption B: ? O N E S  (with ? in position 1)\n\nWe can try to guess ""BONES"".\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we have two possibilities: ""BONES"" and ""NOLES"". How to tell?\n\nIf we guess ""BONES"":\n  If the word is ""BONES"", we win.\n\n  If the word is ""NOLES"", then:\n    B: absent -> x\n    O: ✓\n    N: in position 3? But in ""NOLES"", N is in position 1, so N is present but not in 3 -> N(-)\n    E: ✓\n    S: ✓\n\nSo feedback: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n\nThen we know the word is ? O N E S, and the first letter is not B, and not absent. Then we can guess ""NOLES"" next.\n\nBut we have two guesses left? We are on guess 5, and we have 6 guesses total, so we have two more. But we are on the fifth guess, so after this, one more if needed.\n\nBut we can do that.\n\nBut we might be able to guess the word.\n\nWe can also try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have to put N in position 3? But we are putting N in position 3? Then position 1 is the new letter.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word: ""BONES"" is not a word, and ""SONES"" has S in position 1 which is forbidden.\n\nSo I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don\'t have a good word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess ""NOLES"".\n\nBut let\'s think: we have to make a choice.\n\nWe can also consider that in the first guess, we had N in position 4 (wrong) and in the second guess, we had N in position 2 (wrong). So position 1 is the only position left for N.\n\nSimilarly, S must be in 5.\n\nSo I think ""BONES"" is a solid guess.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback from guess 4: we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is not in 1 and not in 3, so 5 is the only possibility.\n\nSimilarly, N not in 2 or 4, so 1 or 3.\n\nBut if we put N in position 1 and S in position 5, then we have position 3 to fill.\n\nWe can try ""NOLES"".\n\nBut I think ""BONES"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to avoid using absent letters. D is absent, so ""SONED"" is out.\n\nNow, if we guess ""BONES"", what if the word is ""NOLES""? Then we get the feedback as above.\n\nBut we can then guess ""NOLES"" next.\n\nBut we have two guesses left, so it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that has a new letter in position 1 and N in position 3? But we need to include S in position 5? Then we have position 1 and 3: one is the new letter, and the other is not S? But we need S in 5.\n\nSo we cannot test both at once.\n\nTherefore, I think ""BONES"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BONES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that can test both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1? But we don\'t have a word.\n\nOr a word that has N in position 3? But then we don\'t test position 1 for N.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""BONES"" is the best.\n\nSo, fourth guess: ""BONES""\n\nBut let\'s write it.\n\nBut we must not use absent letters. B is not in the absent list, so it\'s okay.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""BONES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.\n- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.\n- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.\n- **O** is fixed in **position 2** (confirmed by Guess 4).\n- **S** must be in **position 5** because:\n  - S is present (from Guess 2 and 4).\n  - S cannot be in position 1 (Guess 4: S in position 1 → \'-\') or 3 (Guess 2: S in position 3 → \'-\').\n  - Positions 2 and 4 are occupied by O and E, so S must be in 5.\n- **N** must be in **position 1 or 3**:\n  - N is present (from all guesses) but cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2), 4 (Guess 1), or 3 (Guess 4). Thus, N must be in 1 or 3.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D (cannot appear).\n- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).\n\n### Deduced Word Structure:\nThe secret word must be of the form:\n- **Position 1**: N (if not, then position 3 must be N) \n- **Position 2**: O (fixed)\n- **Position 3**: ? (if N is in 1, then position 3 is a new letter; if N is in 3, then position 1 is a new letter)\n- **Position 4**: E (fixed)\n- **Position 5**: S (deduced)\n\nThus, two candidate word patterns:\n1. **N O ? E S** (e.g., ""BONES"", ""NOLES"", ""NOXES"")\n2. **? O N E S** (e.g., ""BONES"" is invalid because S cannot be in position 1, so this is only if N is in position 3)\n\n### Strategy for Guess 5:\n- Test **BONES** to resolve the ambiguity between the two patterns:\n  - If correct, we solve the word.\n  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOLES** (since ""NOLES"" is the only other common word fitting pattern 1).\n\n**Why BONES?**\n- Tests **N in position 1** (if correct, we confirm; if not, N must be in position 3).\n- Tests **S in position 5** (already deduced, but we need to confirm the fifth letter).\n- Uses **B** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 1 to probe for the missing letter.\n\nThis guess will either:\n- Confirm the word (if N in 1 and S in 5 are correct).\n- Reveal that N must be in position 3 (and the word is ? O N E S) if N is marked as present but wrong position (while S is correct in position 5).\n\n<guess>bones</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: onset -> FEEDBACK: O(-) N(-) S(-) E(✓) T(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nGuess 4: soned -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 5: bones -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""bones"":
  B: x (not in the word)
  O: ✓ (correct position, as we already knew)
  N: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  S: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- B is absent (so the fifth letter is not B).
- N is present but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for N in position 3).
- E and S are correct in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

But we already knew E in 4 and S in 5.

Now, combining all feedback:

We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

We also know:
- N is present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2), not in position 3 (from guess 5), and not in position 4 (from guess 1 and 4). 
  - Guess 1: N in position 4 (wrong)
  - Guess 2: N in position 2 (wrong)
  - Guess 5: N in position 3 (wrong)
  - So N must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and ... but position 1 is the only one not tested? 
    Positions: 
      1: not tested? We haven't tested N in position 1? 
      2: O (tested and wrong)
      3: tested and wrong (by N in 3? But we tested N in 3 and it was wrong, so not 3)
      4: E (tested and correct)
      5: S (tested and correct)
    So N must be in position 1? Because it's the only position not ruled out? 

But wait: we tested N in positions 2,3,4 and they were wrong. Position 1 has not been tested for N. So N must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word starts with N.

So the word is: N O ? E S

Now, we know the word is N O ? E S, and the missing letter in position 3 is to be found.

We also know the absent letters: C, R, A, T, D, B (from previous feedback).

So the missing letter in position 3 must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T, D, B} and not O, N, E, S? Assuming no duplicates.

We need to find a letter for position 3 that forms a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""NOLES"": with L in position 3 -> N O L E S
- ""NOXES"": with X in position 3 -> N O X E S
- ""NOISE"": but I is in position 3? N O I S E -> but E is in position 5? We need E in position 4 and S in position 5? In ""NOISE"", S is in position 4 and E in position 5? Not matching.

We need E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So:
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> position 3: L
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> position 3: X
- ""NOSES"": but S is in position 3? Not allowed because S cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong, so S not in 3). Also, we have two S's? But we know S is in position 5, so if we put S in position 3, it would be wrong.

So ""NOSES"" is invalid.

""NOE S"" is not 5 letters.

Other words: ""NONES""? But N is repeated? And position 3: N? But we have N in position 1? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so assume no duplicates.

""NONES"" has two N's? But we have N in position 1 and 3? But we know N is in position 1? So if we put N in position 3, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two N's? But in the first guess, we had one N and it was marked present, so if there were two N's, we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: in the first guess, we only had one N, and it was marked present. So if the word has two N's, we wouldn't know because we only provided one N. Similarly in other guesses.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But in this case, if we put N in position 3, it would be a duplicate? But we are trying to find the word.

But let's see the feedback: if we guess ""NOLES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then it's correct.

If the word is ""NOXES"", then we get L absent.

But we have only two candidates left: ""NOLES"" and ""NOXES"".

We can guess ""NOLES"".

But we have one more guess? We are on guess 6? We have two guesses left? Total 6, we used 5, so two more.

We can guess ""NOLES"".

But let's see: if we guess ""NOLES"", and it's not the word, we get feedback that L is absent? Then we know it must be ""NOXES"".

Similarly, if we guess ""NOXES"" and it's not, then it must be ""NOLES"".

So we can guess one of them.

But we can also try to guess a word that uses a new letter to test? But we only have one position to fill, and we have two possibilities. We can guess one.

But we can also try to use a word that has both? But we cannot, because we have to put one letter in position 3.

So I think we should guess ""NOLES"".

But let me confirm: 
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S

We know L and X are not in the absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D,B. So L and X are not in that list? L is not absent, X is not absent.

So both are possible.

But we can guess ""NOLES"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know it's ""NOXES"".

But we have two guesses left, so it's okay.

But we might be able to solve it in this guess.

We can also consider: in the feedback for guess 5, we have N marked as present but wrong position. But we know N is in position 1? So if we put N in position 1 and it's correct, then we get ✓ for N? But in ""bones"", we put N in position 3? And it was marked as present but wrong position? That means N is in the word but not in position 3? So if N is in position 1, then it should be marked as present but not in position 3? Which we got.

Similarly, S in position 5 is correct? So we got S(✓).

But we don't have feedback for position 3? In ""bones"", position 3 was L, which was absent? So we don't get information about position 3.

But we know the word is N O ? E S, and the third letter is missing.

We can try to guess ""NOLES"".

But let's see the previous feedback: in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is in position 5 and N is in position 1.

So the word is N O ? E S.

We can guess ""NOLES"".

If it's not, then we know it's ""NOXES"".

But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

But we might be able to guess ""NOLES"" now.

But let's see the absent letters: we have absent: C,R,A,T,D,B.

L is not absent, so ""NOLES"" is possible.

X is not absent, so ""NOXES"" is possible.

So I'll guess ""NOLES"".

But we must not use absent letters. L is not absent, so it's okay.

Therefore, sixth guess: ""NOLES""

But let's write it.

But we are on the sixth guess, and we have two more if needed.

So, I think that's it.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.
- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.
- **Guess 5: bones** → B absent; O, E, S correct in positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Position 2**: O (confirmed by Guess 4 and 5).
- **Position 4**: E (confirmed).
- **Position 5**: S (deduced from the constraints: S must be in position 5, as it cannot be in 1, 3, and positions 2/4 are occupied).
- **Position 1**: Must be N (since N is present, cannot be in 2, 3, or 4, and position 5 is S, leaving position 1 as the only option).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D, B (excluded).
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, B, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).

The secret word must be **N O ? E S**, where ""?"" is a letter not in the absent list. Common words fitting this pattern are:
- **NOLES** (meaning: a shoelace or a bone) → L in position 3.
- **NOXES** (meaning: a type of bomb or plural of noxius) → X in position 3.

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- Test **NOLES** to resolve between the two candidates:
  - If correct, the word is solved.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOXES** (since only two options remain).

**Why NOLES?**
- Tests **N in position 1** (already deduced) and **S in position 5** (already deduced).
- Uses **L** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 3 to probe for the missing letter.
- Avoids absent letters (C, R, A, T, D, B).

If ""NOLES"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm L is absent, leaving **NOXES** as the only possibility for the next guess.

<guess>noles</guess>",noles,"We are given feedback for the fifth guess ""bones"":
  B: x (not in the word)
  O: ✓ (correct position, as we already knew)
  N: - (present but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (correct position)
  S: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- B is absent (so the fifth letter is not B).
- N is present but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for N in position 3).
- E and S are correct in positions 4 and 5 respectively.

But we already knew E in 4 and S in 5.

Now, combining all feedback:

We know:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: S

We also know:
- N is present, but not in position 2 (from guess 2), not in position 3 (from guess 5), and not in position 4 (from guess 1 and 4). 
  - Guess 1: N in position 4 (wrong)
  - Guess 2: N in position 2 (wrong)
  - Guess 5: N in position 3 (wrong)
  - So N must be in position 1? Because the only positions left are 1 and ... but position 1 is the only one not tested? 
    Positions: 
      1: not tested? We haven't tested N in position 1? 
      2: O (tested and wrong)
      3: tested and wrong (by N in 3? But we tested N in 3 and it was wrong, so not 3)
      4: E (tested and correct)
      5: S (tested and correct)
    So N must be in position 1? Because it's the only position not ruled out? 

But wait: we tested N in positions 2,3,4 and they were wrong. Position 1 has not been tested for N. So N must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word starts with N.

So the word is: N O ? E S

Now, we know the word is N O ? E S, and the missing letter in position 3 is to be found.

We also know the absent letters: C, R, A, T, D, B (from previous feedback).

So the missing letter in position 3 must be a letter not in {C, R, A, T, D, B} and not O, N, E, S? Assuming no duplicates.

We need to find a letter for position 3 that forms a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- ""NOLES"": with L in position 3 -> N O L E S
- ""NOXES"": with X in position 3 -> N O X E S
- ""NOISE"": but I is in position 3? N O I S E -> but E is in position 5? We need E in position 4 and S in position 5? In ""NOISE"", S is in position 4 and E in position 5? Not matching.

We need E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So:
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S -> position 3: L
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S -> position 3: X
- ""NOSES"": but S is in position 3? Not allowed because S cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2: S in position 3 was marked as present but wrong, so S not in 3). Also, we have two S's? But we know S is in position 5, so if we put S in position 3, it would be wrong.

So ""NOSES"" is invalid.

""NOE S"" is not 5 letters.

Other words: ""NONES""? But N is repeated? And position 3: N? But we have N in position 1? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so assume no duplicates.

""NONES"" has two N's? But we have N in position 1 and 3? But we know N is in position 1? So if we put N in position 3, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two N's? But in the first guess, we had one N and it was marked present, so if there were two N's, we would have seen two marks? Actually, no: in the first guess, we only had one N, and it was marked present. So if the word has two N's, we wouldn't know because we only provided one N. Similarly in other guesses.

But to be safe, we should consider the possibility of duplicates? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But in this case, if we put N in position 3, it would be a duplicate? But we are trying to find the word.

But let's see the feedback: if we guess ""NOLES"", and the word is ""NOLES"", then it's correct.

If the word is ""NOXES"", then we get L absent.

But we have only two candidates left: ""NOLES"" and ""NOXES"".

We can guess ""NOLES"".

But we have one more guess? We are on guess 6? We have two guesses left? Total 6, we used 5, so two more.

We can guess ""NOLES"".

But let's see: if we guess ""NOLES"", and it's not the word, we get feedback that L is absent? Then we know it must be ""NOXES"".

Similarly, if we guess ""NOXES"" and it's not, then it must be ""NOLES"".

So we can guess one of them.

But we can also try to guess a word that uses a new letter to test? But we only have one position to fill, and we have two possibilities. We can guess one.

But we can also try to use a word that has both? But we cannot, because we have to put one letter in position 3.

So I think we should guess ""NOLES"".

But let me confirm: 
- ""NOLES"": N O L E S
- ""NOXES"": N O X E S

We know L and X are not in the absent list? Absent letters: C,R,A,T,D,B. So L and X are not in that list? L is not absent, X is not absent.

So both are possible.

But we can guess ""NOLES"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know it's ""NOXES"".

But we have two guesses left, so it's okay.

But we might be able to solve it in this guess.

We can also consider: in the feedback for guess 5, we have N marked as present but wrong position. But we know N is in position 1? So if we put N in position 1 and it's correct, then we get ✓ for N? But in ""bones"", we put N in position 3? And it was marked as present but wrong position? That means N is in the word but not in position 3? So if N is in position 1, then it should be marked as present but not in position 3? Which we got.

Similarly, S in position 5 is correct? So we got S(✓).

But we don't have feedback for position 3? In ""bones"", position 3 was L, which was absent? So we don't get information about position 3.

But we know the word is N O ? E S, and the third letter is missing.

We can try to guess ""NOLES"".

But let's see the previous feedback: in guess 4, we had ""soned"" which had S in position 1 (wrong) and N in position 3 (wrong). And we know S is in position 5 and N is in position 1.

So the word is N O ? E S.

We can guess ""NOLES"".

If it's not, then we know it's ""NOXES"".

But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

But we might be able to guess ""NOLES"" now.

But let's see the absent letters: we have absent: C,R,A,T,D,B.

L is not absent, so ""NOLES"" is possible.

X is not absent, so ""NOXES"" is possible.

So I'll guess ""NOLES"".

But we must not use absent letters. L is not absent, so it's okay.

Therefore, sixth guess: ""NOLES""

But let's write it.

But we are on the sixth guess, and we have two more if needed.

So, I think that's it.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C, R, A absent; N and E present but not in positions 4 or 5.
- **Guess 2: onset** → O, N, S present but not in positions 1, 2, or 3; E correct in position 4; T absent.
- **Guess 4: soned** → S present but not in position 1; O correct in position 2; N present but not in position 3; E correct in position 4; D absent.
- **Guess 5: bones** → B absent; O, E, S correct in positions 2, 4, and 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Position 2**: O (confirmed by Guess 4 and 5).
- **Position 4**: E (confirmed).
- **Position 5**: S (deduced from the constraints: S must be in position 5, as it cannot be in 1, 3, and positions 2/4 are occupied).
- **Position 1**: Must be N (since N is present, cannot be in 2, 3, or 4, and position 5 is S, leaving position 1 as the only option).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, T, D, B (excluded).
- **Fifth letter**: Unknown, but not C, R, A, T, D, B, and not O, N, S, E (assuming no duplicates).

The secret word must be **N O ? E S**, where ""?"" is a letter not in the absent list. Common words fitting this pattern are:
- **NOLES** (meaning: a shoelace or a bone) → L in position 3.
- **NOXES** (meaning: a type of bomb or plural of noxius) → X in position 3.

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- Test **NOLES** to resolve between the two candidates:
  - If correct, the word is solved.
  - If incorrect, the word must be **NOXES** (since only two options remain).

**Why NOLES?**
- Tests **N in position 1** (already deduced) and **S in position 5** (already deduced).
- Uses **L** (a common letter not yet tested) in position 3 to probe for the missing letter.
- Avoids absent letters (C, R, A, T, D, B).

If ""NOLES"" is incorrect, the feedback will confirm L is absent, leaving **NOXES** as the only possibility for the next guess.",Guess 6: noles -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL
