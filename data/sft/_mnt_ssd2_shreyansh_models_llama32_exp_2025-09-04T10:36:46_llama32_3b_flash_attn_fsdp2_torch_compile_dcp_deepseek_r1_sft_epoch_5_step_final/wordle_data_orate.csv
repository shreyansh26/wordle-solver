We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.
- C and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R A _ E

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position, A in the third, and E in the fifth.
- Avoids using C and N (since they are not in the word).
- Includes new letters to test for the first and fourth positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the first and fourth positions.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R A _ E:

Let's think of words: 
- GRAPE: G in first, R in second, A in third, P in fourth, E in fifth. But we haven't tested G and P.
- GRATE: G in first, R in second, A in third, T in fourth, E in fifth. T is common.
- BRACE: B in first, R in second, A in third, C in fourth, E in fifth. But C is already known to be absent, so avoid C.
- FRAME: F in first, R in second, A in third, M in fourth, E in fifth. F and M are new.

But note: we must avoid C and N (from the first guess).

Let me list some words:
- GRAPE: G, R, A, P, E -> P is new, G is new.
- GRATE: G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.
- FRAME: F, R, A, M, E -> F and M are new.
- TRADE: T, R, A, D, E -> T and D are new.

We also have to consider that the first letter cannot be C (absent) and the fourth letter cannot be N (absent).

I think ""GRATE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: G, R, A, T, E. T is a very common consonant.

Alternatively, ""TRADE"" uses T, R, A, D, E. D is also common.

But note: we have three letters fixed: R, A, E. We are only missing the first and fourth letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""GRATE"", we test G and T. In ""TRADE"", we test T and D. Both are good.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so we cannot use N. And also, the pattern requires _ R A _ E, so BRINE would be B R I N E, but N is absent and also the fourth letter is N which we know is absent? Wait, feedback said N: x, meaning N is not in the word at all, so we cannot use N.

Similarly, we cannot use C.

So let's avoid C and N.

Another word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) but it's uncommon. Maybe not.

Let's stick with common words.

I think ""GRATE"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests G and T.

But note: the first letter is G, and the fourth is T.

Alternatively, ""TRADE"" has T in first and D in fourth.

We might also consider ""FRAME"", but F is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.

Let me check the frequency of letters in English words.

But since we are in the second guess, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""GRATE"" to test G and T.

So the guess is ""GRATE"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""grate"" is valid.

So the second guess: GRATE.

We'll get feedback on G and T.

If G is in the first position and correct, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x. Similarly for T in the fourth position.

This will help us narrow down.

Therefore, the next guess is ""grate"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and N are not in the word (x).
- R, A, and E are in the correct positions (✓). Specifically: 
  - R is the second letter.
  - A is the third letter.
  - E is the fifth letter.

The secret word must be of the form: _ R A _ E.

For the second guess, I chose ""grate"" because:
- It maintains the confirmed letters R (second position), A (third position), and E (fifth position).
- It tests new common letters (G and T) in the first and fourth positions.
- It avoids the absent letters C and N.

- GRATE: G in first, R in second, A in third, T in fourth, E in fifth. T is common.
- BRACE: B in first, R in second, A in third, C in fourth, E in fifth. But C is already known to be absent, so avoid C.
- FRAME: F in first, R in second, A in third, M in fourth, E in fifth. F and M are new.

But note: we must avoid C and N (from the first guess).

Let me list some words:
- GRAPE: G, R, A, P, E -> P is new, G is new.
- GRATE: G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.
- FRAME: F, R, A, M, E -> F and M are new.
- TRADE: T, R, A, D, E -> T and D are new.

T is a very common consonant.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRADE"" uses T, R, A, D, E. D is also common.\n\nBut note: we have three letters fixed: R, A, E. We are only missing the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""GRATE"", we test G and T. In ""TRADE"", we test T and D. Both are good.\n\nAnother option: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so we cannot use N. And also, the pattern requires _ R A _ E, so BRINE would be B R I N E, but N is absent and also the fourth letter is N which we know is absent? Wait, feedback said N: x, meaning N is not in the word at all, so we cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use C.\n\nSo let\'s avoid C and N.\n\nAnother word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) but it\'s uncommon. Maybe not.\n\nLet\'s stick with common words.\n\nI think ""GRATE"" is a good choice because it\'s a common word and tests G and T.\n\nBut note: the first letter is G, and the fourth is T.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRADE"" has T in first and D in fourth.\n\nWe might also consider ""FRAME"", but F is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.\n\nLet me check the frequency of letters in English words.\n\nBut since we are in the second guess, we can choose either.\n\nI\'ll go with ""GRATE"" to test G and T.\n\nSo the guess is ""GRATE"".\n\nBut note: we must make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""grate"" is valid.\n\nSo the second guess: GRATE.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on G and T.\n\nIf G is in the first position and correct, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x. Similarly for T in the fourth position.\n\nThis will help us narrow down.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""grate"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and N are not in the word (x).\n- R, A, and E are in the correct positions (✓). Specifically: \n  - R is the second letter.\n  - A is the third letter.\n  - E is the fifth letter.\n\nThe secret word must be of the form: _ R A _ E.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""grate"" because:\n- It maintains the confirmed letters R (second position), A (third position), and E (fifth position).\n- It tests new common letters (G and T) in the first and fourth positions.\n- It avoids the absent letters C and N.\n\n<guess>grate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: grate -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so fifth letter is E)

Guess 2: ""grate""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter A)
- T: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is T)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter E)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R A T E (since R, A, T, E are all in correct positions, and we have the pattern _ R A T E)
- The first letter is unknown but must not be C (from first guess) or G (from second guess), and also must not be N or other absent letters.

We also know that the word does not contain C, N, or G.

Now, the word must be a 5-letter word ending with ""RATE"", but specifically the pattern is: [first letter] R A T E.

We need to find a word that fits: ? R A T E

Possible words:
- BRATE? Not a word.
- DRATE? Not a word.
- FRATE? Not a word.
- IRATE: I is a vowel, and ""irate"" is a word. Let's check: I-R-A-T-E. Yes, ""irate"" is a valid word.
- ORATE: O-R-A-T-E. ""Orate"" is a valid word (meaning to have been in circulation or use).
- URATE: U-R-A-T-E. ""Urate"" is a valid word (a compound).
- CRATE: But C is absent, so not possible.
- GRATE: We already tried, and G is absent.

Other possibilities: 
- PRATE: P-R-A-T-E. ""Prate"" is an archaic word for talk foolishly.
- WRATE? Not common.

Common words: 
- ORATE is common.
- IRATE is common.
- URATE is less common but valid.

We also have to consider that the first letter cannot be a letter we know is absent: C, N, G.

So let's list possible first letters that make a valid English word ending with ""RATE"":

- I: irate
- O: orate
- U: urate
- P: prate
- B: brate? Not a word.
- D: drate? Not a word.
- F: frate? Not a word.
- H: hrate? Not a word.
- L: lrate? Not a word.
- M: mrate? Not a word.
- S: srate? Not a word.
- T: trate? Not a word, and also T is already in position 4? But we need a letter for position 1.

Actually, the only common words are ""irate"", ""orate"", and ""prate"". ""Prate"" is less common, but it's valid.

We also have ""wrath"", but that's W-R-A-T-H, not ending with E? Our pattern requires E at the end.

So the word must end with ""ATE"" and specifically with E at the fifth position, so the pattern is ? R A T E.

Therefore, the possible words are:
- IRATE (meaning angry)
- ORATE (meaning having been in circulation or use)
- URATE (a compound, less common)
- PRATE (archaic for talk foolishly)

Now, we need to choose one. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one that uses a letter we haven't tried to maximize information, but note that we only have one position unknown.

However, we must also consider that the word might be one of these. But we have to make a guess that could be correct.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple possibilities, but since we know four letters are fixed, we might as well guess one of the candidates.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try one of these.

To be efficient, we might choose the most common word, which is ""irate"".

But let's see the feedback we would get if it's not ""irate"":

- If we guess ""irate"" and the word is ""orate"", we get: I(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓). Then we know the first letter is not I, so it must be O or U.

Similarly, if we guess ""orate"" and it's wrong, we might get O(x) or something, but since we have multiple options, we can choose a word that helps eliminate others.

However, since we have multiple candidates, we might need to use a guess that includes letters that appear in multiple options.

But in this case, each candidate has a unique first letter: I, O, U, P.

So we can try ""irate"" first.

But we also have to consider that the word might be ""prate"", but it's less common.

Another idea: we can use a word that tests the vowel in the first position. But since we are forced to have R,A,T,E in positions 2,3,4,5, we cannot change those. We must have R in second, A in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

Therefore, our next guess must be one of the words ending with ""RATE"", but we don't know which one.

We can choose ""irate"" as it is a common word.

But let's see the previous feedback: we have confirmed R,A,T,E, so we are only unsure of the first letter.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no letters for the first position that were correct, and in the second guess, G was wrong. So the first letter is not C or G.

So we have four possibilities: I, O, U, P.

We can try ""irate"" (I) and if it's not, then we try another.

But we have three more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we could try a word that includes letters that are not in the candidates but helps nothing? That doesn't seem efficient.

We could try a word that has I, O, U, P in it, but we cannot because the positions are fixed: we must have R,A,T,E in the same positions.

So we must guess a word of the form X R A T E.

Therefore, I will guess ""irate"" because it's a common word and uses I, which we haven't tested.

But note: we haven't tested I at all. So if we guess ""irate"", we test I in the first position.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that I is not in the word or not in that position, but since the word is ?RATE, if I is not the first letter, then I might be absent or present but in wrong position. But in this pattern, the only position is first. So if I is not the first letter, and if it's in the word, it would have to be in a position we haven't fixed, but we haven't fixed any other positions. The other positions are fixed: R, A, T, E are fixed and correct. So if I is in the word, it must be in the first position? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, the duplicates would have to be in the fixed positions? But R,A,T,E are fixed and we don't know about duplicates.

But in the feedback, if the word had an I, and we guessed ""crane"", which had no I, so no information. Similarly, in ""grate"", no I.

So we don't know if I is in the word or not. But if we guess ""irate"", if I is not the first letter, and if I is in the word at all, it would have to be in a position we have fixed? But we haven't fixed any position for I. The fixed positions are R,A,T,E. So if I is in the word, it must be in the first position because there are no other positions to put it? Unless the word has duplicates? For example, if the word was ""IRATE"", then I is in first. If it was ""ORATE"", then I is not present.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in this case, the fixed positions are R,A,T,E. So if the word has an I, it must be in the first position because the other positions are occupied by R,A,T,E. So if I is in the word, it must be the first letter.

Therefore, if we guess ""irate"" and I is not the first letter, then I must be absent, and we can eliminate ""irate"". If I is the first letter and correct, we get a check.

Similarly, if we guess ""orate"", same logic.

So we can choose any.

I think ""irate"" is a good guess.

But let's see the frequency: ""irate"" is very common. ""Orate"" is also common. ""Prate"" is less common. ""Urate"" is less common.

So between ""irate"" and ""orate"", I'll choose ""irate"" because it's more common.

Therefore, I'll guess ""irate"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""irate"" is valid.

So the third guess: ""irate"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know it's ""orate"" or ""prate"" or ""urate"".

But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple, but we cannot because the pattern forces the letters R,A,T,E in the known positions.

So we must guess one of the candidates.

I'll go with ""irate"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are in the correct positions (✓). This established the pattern: _ R A _ E.
- **Guess 2 (""grate"")**: G is absent (x), while R, A, T, and E are in the correct positions (✓). This confirmed the pattern: _ R A T E.

The secret word must be a 5-letter word ending in ""RATE"", with the first letter unknown but not C, N, or G (as these are absent). Common candidates include ""irate"", ""orate"", ""prate"", and ""urate"". 

I chose ""irate"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the common vowel ""I"" in the first position.
- It adheres to the known pattern (_ R A T E).
- If correct, it wins. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if ""I"" is present or absent, narrowing the options to ""orate"", ""prate"", or ""urate"" for subsequent guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the third letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The third letter is A.
- The fifth letter is E.
- C and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R A _ E

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position, A in the third, and E in the fifth.
- Avoids using C and N (since they are not in the word).
- Includes new letters to test for the first and fourth positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible in the first and fourth positions.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ R A _ E:

Let's think of words: 
- GRAPE: G in first, R in second, A in third, P in fourth, E in fifth. But we haven't tested G and P.
- GRATE: G in first, R in second, A in third, T in fourth, E in fifth. T is common.
- BRACE: B in first, R in second, A in third, C in fourth, E in fifth. But C is already known to be absent, so avoid C.
- FRAME: F in first, R in second, A in third, M in fourth, E in fifth. F and M are new.

But note: we must avoid C and N (from the first guess).

Let me list some words:
- GRAPE: G, R, A, P, E -> P is new, G is new.
- GRATE: G, R, A, T, E -> T is new.
- FRAME: F, R, A, M, E -> F and M are new.
- TRADE: T, R, A, D, E -> T and D are new.

We also have to consider that the first letter cannot be C (absent) and the fourth letter cannot be N (absent).

I think ""GRATE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters: G, R, A, T, E. T is a very common consonant.

Alternatively, ""TRADE"" uses T, R, A, D, E. D is also common.

But note: we have three letters fixed: R, A, E. We are only missing the first and fourth letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""GRATE"", we test G and T. In ""TRADE"", we test T and D. Both are good.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is absent, so we cannot use N. And also, the pattern requires _ R A _ E, so BRINE would be B R I N E, but N is absent and also the fourth letter is N which we know is absent? Wait, feedback said N: x, meaning N is not in the word at all, so we cannot use N.

Similarly, we cannot use C.

So let's avoid C and N.

Another word: ""PRASE"" (meaning a type of gemstone) but it's uncommon. Maybe not.

Let's stick with common words.

I think ""GRATE"" is a good choice because it's a common word and tests G and T.

But note: the first letter is G, and the fourth is T.

Alternatively, ""TRADE"" has T in first and D in fourth.

We might also consider ""FRAME"", but F is less common than T? Actually, T is more common.

Let me check the frequency of letters in English words.

But since we are in the second guess, we can choose either.

I'll go with ""GRATE"" to test G and T.

So the guess is ""GRATE"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""grate"" is valid.

So the second guess: GRATE.

We'll get feedback on G and T.

If G is in the first position and correct, we get a check. If not, we might get a dash or an x. Similarly for T in the fourth position.

This will help us narrow down.

Therefore, the next guess is ""grate"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and N are not in the word (x).
- R, A, and E are in the correct positions (✓). Specifically: 
  - R is the second letter.
  - A is the third letter.
  - E is the fifth letter.

The secret word must be of the form: _ R A _ E.

For the second guess, I chose ""grate"" because:
- It maintains the confirmed letters R (second position), A (third position), and E (fifth position).
- It tests new common letters (G and T) in the first and fourth positions.
- It avoids the absent letters C and N.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: grate -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so fifth letter is E)

Guess 2: ""grate""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter A)
- T: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is T)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter E)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R A T E (since R, A, T, E are all in correct positions, and we have the pattern _ R A T E)
- The first letter is unknown but must not be C (from first guess) or G (from second guess), and also must not be N or other absent letters.

We also know that the word does not contain C, N, or G.

Now, the word must be a 5-letter word ending with ""RATE"", but specifically the pattern is: [first letter] R A T E.

We need to find a word that fits: ? R A T E

Possible words:
- BRATE? Not a word.
- DRATE? Not a word.
- FRATE? Not a word.
- IRATE: I is a vowel, and ""irate"" is a word. Let's check: I-R-A-T-E. Yes, ""irate"" is a valid word.
- ORATE: O-R-A-T-E. ""Orate"" is a valid word (meaning to have been in circulation or use).
- URATE: U-R-A-T-E. ""Urate"" is a valid word (a compound).
- CRATE: But C is absent, so not possible.
- GRATE: We already tried, and G is absent.

Other possibilities: 
- PRATE: P-R-A-T-E. ""Prate"" is an archaic word for talk foolishly.
- WRATE? Not common.

Common words: 
- ORATE is common.
- IRATE is common.
- URATE is less common but valid.

We also have to consider that the first letter cannot be a letter we know is absent: C, N, G.

So let's list possible first letters that make a valid English word ending with ""RATE"":

- I: irate
- O: orate
- U: urate
- P: prate
- B: brate? Not a word.
- D: drate? Not a word.
- F: frate? Not a word.
- H: hrate? Not a word.
- L: lrate? Not a word.
- M: mrate? Not a word.
- S: srate? Not a word.
- T: trate? Not a word, and also T is already in position 4? But we need a letter for position 1.

Actually, the only common words are ""irate"", ""orate"", and ""prate"". ""Prate"" is less common, but it's valid.

We also have ""wrath"", but that's W-R-A-T-H, not ending with E? Our pattern requires E at the end.

So the word must end with ""ATE"" and specifically with E at the fifth position, so the pattern is ? R A T E.

Therefore, the possible words are:
- IRATE (meaning angry)
- ORATE (meaning having been in circulation or use)
- URATE (a compound, less common)
- PRATE (archaic for talk foolishly)

Now, we need to choose one. Since we have three possibilities, we can pick one that uses a letter we haven't tried to maximize information, but note that we only have one position unknown.

However, we must also consider that the word might be one of these. But we have to make a guess that could be correct.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests multiple possibilities, but since we know four letters are fixed, we might as well guess one of the candidates.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try one of these.

To be efficient, we might choose the most common word, which is ""irate"".

But let's see the feedback we would get if it's not ""irate"":

- If we guess ""irate"" and the word is ""orate"", we get: I(x) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓). Then we know the first letter is not I, so it must be O or U.

Similarly, if we guess ""orate"" and it's wrong, we might get O(x) or something, but since we have multiple options, we can choose a word that helps eliminate others.

However, since we have multiple candidates, we might need to use a guess that includes letters that appear in multiple options.

But in this case, each candidate has a unique first letter: I, O, U, P.

So we can try ""irate"" first.

But we also have to consider that the word might be ""prate"", but it's less common.

Another idea: we can use a word that tests the vowel in the first position. But since we are forced to have R,A,T,E in positions 2,3,4,5, we cannot change those. We must have R in second, A in third, T in fourth, E in fifth.

Therefore, our next guess must be one of the words ending with ""RATE"", but we don't know which one.

We can choose ""irate"" as it is a common word.

But let's see the previous feedback: we have confirmed R,A,T,E, so we are only unsure of the first letter.

We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no letters for the first position that were correct, and in the second guess, G was wrong. So the first letter is not C or G.

So we have four possibilities: I, O, U, P.

We can try ""irate"" (I) and if it's not, then we try another.

But we have three more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we could try a word that includes letters that are not in the candidates but helps nothing? That doesn't seem efficient.

We could try a word that has I, O, U, P in it, but we cannot because the positions are fixed: we must have R,A,T,E in the same positions.

So we must guess a word of the form X R A T E.

Therefore, I will guess ""irate"" because it's a common word and uses I, which we haven't tested.

But note: we haven't tested I at all. So if we guess ""irate"", we test I in the first position.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that I is not in the word or not in that position, but since the word is ?RATE, if I is not the first letter, then I might be absent or present but in wrong position. But in this pattern, the only position is first. So if I is not the first letter, and if it's in the word, it would have to be in a position we haven't fixed, but we haven't fixed any other positions. The other positions are fixed: R, A, T, E are fixed and correct. So if I is in the word, it must be in the first position? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, the duplicates would have to be in the fixed positions? But R,A,T,E are fixed and we don't know about duplicates.

But in the feedback, if the word had an I, and we guessed ""crane"", which had no I, so no information. Similarly, in ""grate"", no I.

So we don't know if I is in the word or not. But if we guess ""irate"", if I is not the first letter, and if I is in the word at all, it would have to be in a position we have fixed? But we haven't fixed any position for I. The fixed positions are R,A,T,E. So if I is in the word, it must be in the first position because there are no other positions to put it? Unless the word has duplicates? For example, if the word was ""IRATE"", then I is in first. If it was ""ORATE"", then I is not present.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't forbid duplicates, but in this case, the fixed positions are R,A,T,E. So if the word has an I, it must be in the first position because the other positions are occupied by R,A,T,E. So if I is in the word, it must be the first letter.

Therefore, if we guess ""irate"" and I is not the first letter, then I must be absent, and we can eliminate ""irate"". If I is the first letter and correct, we get a check.

Similarly, if we guess ""orate"", same logic.

So we can choose any.

I think ""irate"" is a good guess.

But let's see the frequency: ""irate"" is very common. ""Orate"" is also common. ""Prate"" is less common. ""Urate"" is less common.

So between ""irate"" and ""orate"", I'll choose ""irate"" because it's more common.

Therefore, I'll guess ""irate"".

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""irate"" is valid.

So the third guess: ""irate"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, we know it's ""orate"" or ""prate"" or ""urate"".

But we have more guesses.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests multiple, but we cannot because the pattern forces the letters R,A,T,E in the known positions.

So we must guess one of the candidates.

I'll go with ""irate"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C and N are absent (x), while R, A, and E are in the correct positions (✓). This established the pattern: _ R A _ E.
- **Guess 2 (""grate"")**: G is absent (x), while R, A, T, and E are in the correct positions (✓). This confirmed the pattern: _ R A T E.

The secret word must be a 5-letter word ending in ""RATE"", with the first letter unknown but not C, N, or G (as these are absent). Common candidates include ""irate"", ""orate"", ""prate"", and ""urate"". 

I chose ""irate"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the common vowel ""I"" in the first position.
- It adheres to the known pattern (_ R A T E).
- If correct, it wins. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if ""I"" is present or absent, narrowing the options to ""orate"", ""prate"", or ""urate"" for subsequent guesses.

- E: ✓ (correct position, so fifth letter is E)

Guess 2: ""grate""
- G: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter A)
- T: ✓ (correct position, so fourth letter is T)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter E)

Guess 3: ""irate""
- I: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter A)
- T: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter T)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter E)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R A T E (since R, A, T, E are in the correct positions and are confirmed to be in the word).
- The first letter is not C (from first guess), not G (from second guess), and not I (from third guess). So the first letter must be one of the remaining possibilities that form a valid English word.

The pattern _ R A T E gives us the following constraints:
- The first letter cannot be C, G, or I.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Now, from the feedback, we also know that the word does not contain C, N, or G (from the x's). Additionally, I is not in the word at all (since we got an x for I).

We need to find a word that fits: [first letter] R A T E.

Possible words that come to mind:
- ORATE: O is a vowel that we haven't tested. O is still possible.
- PRATE: P is a consonant that we haven't tested. But note that ""prate"" is an archaic word, so it might be less common. However, it is a valid word.
- URATE: U is a vowel that we haven't tested.

But we must also consider that the word might be ""ORATE"" or ""URATE"". ""PRATE"" is less common, so we might prioritize the more common ones.

However, we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position unknown, we can try one of the candidates.

But note: we have three main candidates: ORATE, PRATE, URATE.

We can try ""ORATE"" because it is a common word.

But let's see: if we guess ""ORATE"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in the first position, but since the word must have O, A, R, T, E, if O is not the first letter, then it must be in the fourth position? But the fourth position is T, which is fixed. So if O is in the word, it must be in the first position? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, the fixed positions are R,A,T,E, and if O is present, it must be in the first position because there are no other positions. Unless the word has a duplicate of O? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But let's think: the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: T (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the only unknown is position 1. Therefore, if the word has an O, it must be in position 1. Similarly, if it has a U, it must be in position 1. If it has a P, it must be in position 1.

But duplicates are possible? For example, if the word is ""ORATE"", then O is in position 1 and also in position 2? But position 2 is R, which is fixed and is a different letter. So if there is a duplicate O, it would have to be in position 1. Similarly, for U: if the word has two U's, then one might be in position 1 and the other in another position, but we don't have any other unknown positions. However, in our pattern, position 1 is the only unknown, so if the word has a duplicate, it must be in position 1.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume that the first letter is a new letter that we haven't tested.

We have tested the letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess); G, R, A, T, E (from second); I, R, A, T, E (from third). So we have tested: C, G, I.

We haven't tested O, U, P, etc.

Now, among the candidates:
- ORATE: first letter O
- PRATE: first letter P
- URATE: first letter U

We can try ""ORATE"" because it is a very common word.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are absent. We know C, N, G, I are absent. O, U, P are all new and not excluded.

So let's try ""ORATE"".

If it's not, then we can try ""PRATE"" or ""URATE"".

But we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the fourth guess). We can try one.

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests multiple candidates at once, but we cannot because the pattern requires the fixed letters R,A,T,E in the same positions. So we must have a word of the form X R A T E.

Therefore, I will guess ""ORATE"".

But let's confirm: ""ORATE"" is a valid word, and it uses O, which we haven't tested.

So the fourth guess: ORATE.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in the first position. But since the word must have O, A, R, T, E, if O is not the first letter, then it must be in the fourth position? But the fourth position is T, which is fixed. So if O is in the word, it must be in position 1. Therefore, if we get O(x), then O is not in the word at all, and we can eliminate it. If we get O(✓), then it's correct.

Similarly for U and P.

But we can only test one at a time.

So I'll go with ""ORATE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word must be a 5-letter word ending in ""RATE"". The pattern is _ R A T E, with the first letter unknown but not C, N, G, or I (as these are absent). 

The only common valid words fitting this pattern are:
- **ORATE** (meaning: having been in circulation or use)
- **PRATE** (archaic for ""to talk foolishly"")
- **URATE** (a chemical compound)

I chose ""ORATE"" as the next guess because:
- It tests the common vowel ""O"" in the first position.
- It adheres to the known pattern (_ R A T E).
- If correct, it wins. If incorrect, the feedback will confirm if ""O"" is present or absent, narrowing the options to ""PRATE"" or ""URATE"" for the next guess.

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)

- T: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter T)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: _ R A T E (since R, A, T, E are in the correct positions and are confirmed to be in the word).
- The first letter is not C (from first guess), not G (from second guess), and not I (from third guess). So the first letter must be one of the remaining possibilities that form a valid English word.

We need to find a word that fits: [first letter] R A T E.

- ORATE: O is a vowel that we haven't tested. O is still possible.
- PRATE: P is a consonant that we haven't tested. But note that ""prate"" is an archaic word, so it might be less common. However, it is a valid word.
- URATE: U is a vowel that we haven't tested.

But we must also consider that the word might be ""ORATE"" or ""URATE"". ""PRATE"" is less common, so we might prioritize the more common ones.

However, we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position unknown, we can try one of the candidates.

But note: we have three main candidates: ORATE, PRATE, URATE.

We can try ""ORATE"" because it is a common word.

But let's see: if we guess ""ORATE"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in the first position, but since the word must have O, A, R, T, E, if O is not the first letter, then it must be in the fourth position? But the fourth position is T, which is fixed. So if O is in the word, it must be in the first position? Not necessarily, because the word might have duplicate letters? But in this case, the fixed positions are R,A,T,E, and if O is present, it must be in the first position because there are no other positions. Unless the word has a duplicate of O? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

But let's think: the word has five letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We have:
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: T (fixed)
- Position 5: E (fixed)

So the only unknown is position 1. Therefore, if the word has an O, it must be in position 1. Similarly, if it has a U, it must be in position 1. If it has a P, it must be in position 1.

But duplicates are possible? For example, if the word is ""ORATE"", then O is in position 1 and also in position 2? But position 2 is R, which is fixed and is a different letter. So if there is a duplicate O, it would have to be in position 1. Similarly, for U: if the word has two U's, then one might be in position 1 and the other in another position, but we don't have any other unknown positions. However, in our pattern, position 1 is the only unknown, so if the word has a duplicate, it must be in position 1.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we can assume that the first letter is a new letter that we haven't tested.

We have tested the letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess); G, R, A, T, E (from second); I, R, A, T, E (from third). So we have tested: C, G, I.

We haven't tested O, U, P, etc.

Now, among the candidates:
- ORATE: first letter O
- PRATE: first letter P
- URATE: first letter U

We can try ""ORATE"" because it is a very common word.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are absent. We know C, N, G, I are absent. O, U, P are all new and not excluded.

So let's try ""ORATE"".

If it's not, then we can try ""PRATE"" or ""URATE"".

Alternatively, we could try a word that tests multiple candidates at once, but we cannot because the pattern requires the fixed letters R,A,T,E in the same positions. So we must have a word of the form X R A T E.

Therefore, I will guess ""ORATE"".

But let's confirm: ""ORATE"" is a valid word, and it uses O, which we haven't tested.

So the fourth guess: ORATE.

If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that O is not in the word or not in the first position. But since the word must have O, A, R, T, E, if O is not the first letter, then it must be in the fourth position? But the fourth position is T, which is fixed. So if O is in the word, it must be in position 1. Therefore, if we get O(x), then O is not in the word at all, and we can eliminate it. If we get O(✓), then it's correct.
