We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A), we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to include other common letters to test for their presence. Common consonants besides R include T, S, L, etc., and vowels we have A (already) and we can try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and also tests other common letters.

 Example words:
 - ""PARTY"": has P, A, R, T, Y. But note: A is in position 2? Actually, in ""PARTY"":
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   However, in our first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but now we are putting R in position 3. That might be okay.
   But we also have to avoid the positions we know: A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so in the secret word A is not in position 3. But in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2, which is allowed.

 However, we must note that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not? We don't know.

 But let's check: if the secret word has R in position 3, then we would get a check (✓) for R. If not, then we get a dash (-) again.

 Also, we are introducing new letters: P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know E is not in the word, so that's okay. However, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T. But note:
   R is in position 1 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2).
   A is in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we can avoid putting A in position 3.

 Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Another idea: ""RADIO"" -> R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not in position 2 (here it's in 1) and A is not in position 3 (here it's in 2). 
   Also, no C, N, E.

 But we are introducing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   Again, R in 1, A in 2 (which is allowed for A because we only know it's not in 3) and we avoid A in 3.

 However, we don't know if S, P, Y are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> T (1), R (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). 
   But wait, R is in position 2? We know from the first guess that R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not a good choice because it puts R in position 2.

 Let me try ""ALARM"": A (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, duplicate A? But the word has two A's? 
   Actually, ""ALARM"" has two A's? No: A-L-A-R-M -> that's 5 letters: A, L, A, R, M. 
   But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, we can avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position, so it would be a waste. We want to test new positions.

 So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). 
   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.

 But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This tests T, I, O.

 Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it's okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). 
   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it's not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don't know if that is correct or not.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). 
   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.

 Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). 
   We are testing P, T, Y.

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that is correct.

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

 How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). 
   But A is in position 3 -> we know it's not there, so we avoid.

 How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.

 Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 We must avoid R in position 2.

 So let's look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). 
   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We are testing P, I, S.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.

 Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it's not in 2). 

 Actually, in ""RASPY"":
   R is in position 1 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it's not in 3).

 So ""RASPY"" seems good: 
   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.

 But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

 How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).

 So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.

 But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".

 However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tested and A in a position we haven't tested.

 We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.

 Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates? 
   Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.

 However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.

 But ""ALARM"" has two A's. We don't know if that's allowed. So it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

 So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.

 But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.

 We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We test P, T, Y.

 I think both are good. Let me choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.

 In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.

 But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.

 I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.

 So let's choose ""PARTY"".

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.

 How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.

 How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). 
   But duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.

 However, we are testing L and Y.

 But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.

 Let me decide: I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the second guess: ""PARTY""

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 We are also testing P, T, Y.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 So the guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked `-`).
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.
- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, P, Y**) to gather more information.

The word **""party""** fits these criteria:
- **P, T, Y** are new untested letters.
- **R** is placed in position 3 (not position 2).
- **A** is placed in position 2 (not position 3).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new letters and position constraints while leveraging the known information.

<guess>party</guess>",party,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 We also want to include other common letters to test for their presence. Common consonants besides R include T, S, L, etc., and vowels we have A (already) and we can try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and also tests other common letters.

 Example words:
 - ""PARTY"": has P, A, R, T, Y. But note: A is in position 2? Actually, in ""PARTY"":
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   However, in our first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but now we are putting R in position 3. That might be okay.
   But we also have to avoid the positions we know: A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so in the secret word A is not in position 3. But in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2, which is allowed.

 However, we must note that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not? We don't know.

 But let's check: if the secret word has R in position 3, then we would get a check (✓) for R. If not, then we get a dash (-) again.

 Also, we are introducing new letters: P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know E is not in the word, so that's okay. However, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T. But note:
   R is in position 1 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2).
   A is in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we can avoid putting A in position 3.

 Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Another idea: ""RADIO"" -> R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not in position 2 (here it's in 1) and A is not in position 3 (here it's in 2). 
   Also, no C, N, E.

 But we are introducing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   Again, R in 1, A in 2 (which is allowed for A because we only know it's not in 3) and we avoid A in 3.

 However, we don't know if S, P, Y are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> T (1), R (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). 
   But wait, R is in position 2? We know from the first guess that R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not a good choice because it puts R in position 2.

 Let me try ""ALARM"": A (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, duplicate A? But the word has two A's? 
   Actually, ""ALARM"" has two A's? No: A-L-A-R-M -> that's 5 letters: A, L, A, R, M. 
   But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, we can avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position, so it would be a waste. We want to test new positions.

 So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). 
   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.

 But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This tests T, I, O.

 Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it's okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). 
   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it's not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don't know if that is correct or not.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). 
   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.

 Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). 
   We are testing P, T, Y.

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that is correct.

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

 How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). 
   But A is in position 3 -> we know it's not there, so we avoid.

 How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.

 Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 We must avoid R in position 2.

 So let's look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). 
   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We are testing P, I, S.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.

 Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it's not in 2). 

 Actually, in ""RASPY"":
   R is in position 1 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it's not in 3).

 So ""RASPY"" seems good: 
   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.

 But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

 How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).

 So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.

 But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".

 However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tested and A in a position we haven't tested.

 We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.

 Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates? 
   Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.

 However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.

 But ""ALARM"" has two A's. We don't know if that's allowed. So it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

 So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.

 But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.

 We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We test P, T, Y.

 I think both are good. Let me choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.

 In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.

 But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.

 I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.

 So let's choose ""PARTY"".

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.

 How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.

 How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). 
   But duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.

 However, we are testing L and Y.

 But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.

 Let me decide: I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the second guess: ""PARTY""

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 We are also testing P, T, Y.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 So the guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked `-`).
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.
- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, P, Y**) to gather more information.

The word **""party""** fits these criteria:
- **P, T, Y** are new untested letters.
- **R** is placed in position 3 (not position 2).
- **A** is placed in position 2 (not position 3).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A), we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to include other common letters to test for their presence. Common consonants besides R include T, S, L, etc., and vowels we have A (already) and we can try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and also tests other common letters.

 Example words:
 - ""PARTY"": has P, A, R, T, Y. But note: A is in position 2? Actually, in ""PARTY"":
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   However, in our first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but now we are putting R in position 3. That might be okay.
   But we also have to avoid the positions we know: A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so in the secret word A is not in position 3. But in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2, which is allowed.

 However, we must note that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not? We don't know.

 But let's check: if the secret word has R in position 3, then we would get a check (✓) for R. If not, then we get a dash (-) again.

 Also, we are introducing new letters: P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know E is not in the word, so that's okay. However, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T. But note:
   R is in position 1 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2).
   A is in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we can avoid putting A in position 3.

 Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Another idea: ""RADIO"" -> R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not in position 2 (here it's in 1) and A is not in position 3 (here it's in 2). 
   Also, no C, N, E.

 But we are introducing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   Again, R in 1, A in 2 (which is allowed for A because we only know it's not in 3) and we avoid A in 3.

 However, we don't know if S, P, Y are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> T (1), R (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). 
   But wait, R is in position 2? We know from the first guess that R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not a good choice because it puts R in position 2.

 Let me try ""ALARM"": A (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, duplicate A? But the word has two A's? 
   Actually, ""ALARM"" has two A's? No: A-L-A-R-M -> that's 5 letters: A, L, A, R, M. 
   But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, we can avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position, so it would be a waste. We want to test new positions.

 So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). 
   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.

 But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This tests T, I, O.

 Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it's okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). 
   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it's not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don't know if that is correct or not.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). 
   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.

 Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). 
   We are testing P, T, Y.

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that is correct.

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

 How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). 
   But A is in position 3 -> we know it's not there, so we avoid.

 How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.

 Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 We must avoid R in position 2.

 So let's look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). 
   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We are testing P, I, S.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.

 Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it's not in 2). 

 Actually, in ""RASPY"":
   R is in position 1 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it's not in 3).

 So ""RASPY"" seems good: 
   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.

 But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

 How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).

 So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.

 But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".

 However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tested and A in a position we haven't tested.

 We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.

 Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates? 
   Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.

 However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.

 But ""ALARM"" has two A's. We don't know if that's allowed. So it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

 So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.

 But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.

 We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We test P, T, Y.

 I think both are good. Let me choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.

 In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.

 But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.

 I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.

 So let's choose ""PARTY"".

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.

 How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.

 How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). 
   But duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.

 However, we are testing L and Y.

 But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.

 Let me decide: I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the second guess: ""PARTY""

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 We are also testing P, T, Y.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 So the guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":

We want to test new positions.\n\n So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.\n\n Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). \n   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.\n\n But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). \n   This tests T, I, O.\n\n Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it\'s okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). \n   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it\'s not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: \n   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). \n   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.\n\n But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don\'t know if that is correct or not.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). \n   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.\n\n Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). \n   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). \n   We are testing P, T, Y.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that is correct.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.\n\n How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). \n   But A is in position 3 -> we know it\'s not there, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.\n\n Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.\n\n How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n We must avoid R in position 2.\n\n So let\'s look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n\n Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). \n   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). \n   We are testing P, I, S.\n\n But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\n Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). \n   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it\'s not in 2). \n\n Actually, in ""RASPY"":\n   R is in position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so we can test it.\n   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems good: \n   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.\n\n But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.\n\n But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".\n\n However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tested and A in a position we haven\'t tested.\n\n We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.\n\n In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.\n\n Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates? \n   Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.\n\n However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don\'t know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.\n\n But ""ALARM"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. So it\'s safer to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.\n\n But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.\n\n We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). \n   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). \n   We test P, T, Y.\n\n I think both are good. Let me choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.\n\n In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.\n\n But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.\n\n I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.\n\n But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.\n\n So let\'s choose ""PARTY"".\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.\n\n Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.\n\n How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). \n   But duplicate L? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.\n\n However, we are testing L and Y.\n\n But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.\n\n Let me decide: I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n So the second guess: ""PARTY""\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n We are also testing P, T, Y.\n\n If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\n So the guess is ""party"".\n\n<guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked `-`).\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.\n- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, P, Y**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""party""** fits these criteria:\n- **P, T, Y** are new untested letters.\n- **R** is placed in position 3 (not position 2).\n- **A** is placed in position 2 (not position 3).\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new letters and position constraints while leveraging the known information.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got dash]
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [so R is in position 3!]
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 3.
- The secret word has A, but not in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Also, from guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (but now we know it is in position 3, so that's consistent).

Now, A must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).

We also know the word has A and R (with R fixed at position 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3.
- Has A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, Y.
- We can use other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We should try to test common letters that haven't been tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Position 3 is R: so the word is _ _ R _ _

And A must be in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

Let's try to list possibilities:

Option 1: A in position 1: A _ R _ _
Option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _
Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A _ R _ _
We need two letters for positions 2, 4, and 5. But note: we have only three positions to fill? Actually, position 1 is A, position 3 is R, so positions 2,4,5 are open. But we have two more letters to place? Actually, the word has 5 letters: A, ?, R, ?, ?

We know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a candidate. Then for positions 2,4,5 we need letters that are not in the exclusion list.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Let's try to think of words: A _ R _ _

Possible words: 
- ""AORTA""? But A is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O and T: T is excluded. T is not allowed.
- ""ABRIM""? A (1), B (2), R (3), I (4), M (5). This uses B, I, M. But we don't know if they are in the word. And T is not used? Actually, no T. But we have to avoid T? T is excluded because in guess2 T was x. So ""ABRIM"" is a valid word? It's an adjective meaning bitter, but it's obscure. Maybe not the best.

- ""ACRID""? But C is excluded.

- ""ADORE""? But E is excluded.

- ""AGREE""? E is excluded and duplicate E? Not allowed.

- ""ALARM""? But L is allowed, but we have A in position 1 and then L, A, R, M? Duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, M is allowed. But we have A in position 1 and then A in position 4? That would be A, L, A, R, M? But that's ""ALARM"": A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so that doesn't match. We need position 3 to be R, so ""ALARM"" has A in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But position 3 must be R. So no.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for option 1: A _ R _ _
Possible words:
- ""AURORA"": A(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, U and O are allowed. But we have two R's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we know R is in position 3, so if there is another R, it would be in position 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, ""AURORA"" has E? No, A,U,R,O,R,A? Actually, it's A-U-R-O-R-A? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AURORA"" is 5 letters: A-U-R-O-R-A? No, that's 6. ""AURORA"" is 5: A, U, R, O, R? Then duplicates. But we don't know.

Let me check: ""AURORA"" has two R's. But we don't know if the word has two R's. We only know one R is in position 3.

But we can try? However, we are limited by the letters.

Alternatively, ""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another: ""ADORE"" -> but E is excluded.

""AGREE"" -> E excluded.

""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so not.

It's hard to find a word with A in 1 and R in 3 without using excluded letters.

Try ""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> but position 3 is B, not R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So: A _ R _ _

Possible: 
- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Not allowed? We don't know, but T is excluded so we can't use T.

- ""AUROR"": Not a word? Aurora is 6.

- ""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

It seems difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.

Try option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _

So the word is _ _ R A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

Letters to use: not C,N,E,P,T,Y.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""BORAX"": B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This uses B, O, X. X is not common.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is a word? Foram means a chamber in anatomy. Obscure.

""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word. It means a furrow in geography. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have F, U, L. We don't know if they are in the word.

Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

So the word is _ _ R ? A

We need to fill position 1,2,4.

Example: ""CURIA"": but C is excluded.

""BORIA"": B(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). This is a word? Boria is a geographical term. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have B, O, I.

We can also consider ""FORSA"": not a word.

""HEROA"": not common.

""VERA_"" -> but E is excluded.

It's hard to find common words.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in position 4 or 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we also know that the word has A and R (with R fixed at 3).

We have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters.

For example: ""LORRY"": L(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but Y is excluded, and duplicate R? And Y is not allowed.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> but A cannot be in position 2! We know from guess2 that A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2.

In ""MANOR"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

We must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 2 (but we already know R is not in position 2, and we have R in 3).

So for the word, we have: positions 1,2,4,5 to fill, but with A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We can try ""DOULA"": D(1), O(2), U(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

""VIRGA"": V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), A(5). This is a word (a streak of rain). But we have V, I, G. V is not very common.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> but R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2.

In ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed, and N is excluded.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be in position 4.

Let me search for words with R in position 3 and A in position 4.

For example: ""FURAL"" as I thought earlier: F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a valid word.

Another: ""CURVA"" -> C excluded.

""BURKA"": B(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in position 5, not 4. And we are looking for A in position 4? No, this has A in 5.

We want A in position 4: so the word pattern: _ _ R A _

So position 4 is A.

Example: ""FORAM"" (as before) or ""FURAL"" (as above) or ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word (a type of fish). Valid.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses S, O, L.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

We can also try ""DORAD"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5). Duplicate D? And D is allowed. But ""DORAD"" is a type of fish? Valid.

But let's choose a word that uses more common letters.

Another: ""HORDE"": H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is valid.

But we have F, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Example: ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MARIA"": M(1), A(2) -> same issue.

""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 must be R, so it's R(1), A(2), D(3) -> but we need R(3), so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Examples:
- ""CURIA"" -> C excluded.
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.
- ""FURCA"": F(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), A(5) -> C excluded.

""URALA"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""VIZIR"": V(1), I(2), Z(3) -> position 3 is Z, not R.

It's challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""BORAX"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This has A in position 4.

But X is not common.

""FORAM"" and ""FURAL"" are options.

But let's think of words with A in position 5.

""KARMA"": K(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSA"": P(1) -> but P is excluded.

""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. We need position 3 to be R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Possible: ""CURIA"" is not because of C and position 3 is C.

""TERRA"": T(1) excluded, E(2) excluded.

""ZEBRA"": Z(1), E(2) excluded.

It's very hard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has A in position 4 and uses common letters.

Let me list possible words:

- ""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses F, U, L.
- ""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). Uses F, O, M.
- ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Uses S, O, L.
- ""DORAB"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), B(5). Uses D, O, B.
- ""KORAS"": K(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). Uses K, O, S.

We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K.

""FURAL"" uses F, U, L. F is not very common, U is vowel, L is common.

""SORAL"" uses S, O, L. S and O are common, L is common.

""FORAM"" uses F, O, M. F and O are reasonable.

""DORAB"" uses D, O, B. D and B are common.

""KORAS"" uses K, O, S. K is less common.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice because it uses S, O, L which are common.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to test A in position 5.

But we couldn't find a common word for A in position 5 with R in 3.

Another word for A in position 5: ""TOLYA"" -> T excluded.

""VISTA"": V(1), I(2), S(3) -> position 3 is S, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So let's go with ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and confirms A in position 4.

But we are not testing position 5 for A. We are testing A in position 4.

If we get feedback that A is in the word but not in position 4, then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a good word for A in position 5.

Another word: ""DRAKE"" -> E excluded.

""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""BRAND"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

We are stuck with A in position 4.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

After research: ""LYCRA"": L(1), Y(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.

""SYNRA"": not a word.

""ZEBRA"": E excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good option.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""DURAL"": D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word (relating to the dura mater).

But we have D, U, L.

I think ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's see: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Another word: ""HORSA"": H(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), A(5). This has A in position 5. And S in position 4.

This is a valid word (a type of horse). And it tests H, O, S.

But H and O are reasonable.

However, we are putting A in position 5, which is a candidate.

And we test H, O, S.

But we also have position 4: S.

So ""HORSA"" is a possibility.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: H, O, S are not excluded? Excluded are C,N,E,P,T,Y. So H, O, S are allowed.

Similarly, ""HORSA"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

""SORAL"": tests S, O, L (with A in position 4)
""HORSA"": tests H, O, S (with A in position 5)

Both test O and S. The difference is L vs H.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another word: ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So back to ""SORAL"" or ""HORSA"".

I think ""HORSA"" is less common, but ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's consider: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So if we put A in position 5, and it's not there, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4. But we don't have a good word for position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

But we had trouble.

Another word: ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 3 is H, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

""ABHOR"" is A-B-H-O-R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). So position 3 is H, not R.

Not.

""ALARM"" is A-L-A-R-M -> position 3 is A, not R.

So I think we have to choose between ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

But there is another word: ""DRAKE"" is out because of E.

""GRAPE"" -> E excluded.

""BRASH"": B(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""CRASH"": C excluded.

So let's go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, in ""SORAL"": 
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3 (we know this is correct, so we expect a check for R? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback on S, O, L.)

But we are testing A in position 4.

If A is actually in position 4, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash or if it's not there? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we get a dash for A? No: if A is in the word but not in position 4, we get a dash. If it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so it must be either position 1,4,5. If we put it in 4 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 5. If we put it in 5 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 4. But we don't know which.

But we are trying to find the word.

Another word: ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""JARUL"" -> not a word.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

""LYCRA"" is not.

""SYNCH"" -> C excluded.

""ZEBRA"" -> E excluded.

""UMBRA"": U(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), A(5). Position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""OPERA"": O(1), P(2), E(3) -> E and P excluded.

So I think we should go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, we have another option: ""DURAL"" (relating to the dura mater) -> D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word.

But ""SORAL"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""HORSA"" is also valid.

But ""HORSA"" has A in position 5, which is a candidate.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSH"": P excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SORAL"":
- S: if it's in the word, we get feedback.
- O: same.
- L: same.

And for A: if A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can adjust.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another word: ""GROSS"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So I think ""SORAL"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

For example: ""AROSE"" -> E excluded.

""AROMA"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). This is a valid word. It tests B, I, M.

But we have A in position 1, which is a candidate.

And we test B, I, M.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ABRIM"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, I, M.

But ""ABRIM"" has A in position 1 and R in position 3.

We know R is in position 3, so we are confirming that.

And we test B, I, M.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have the option to test more vowels? We have A already, and we know E is out. So O and I are good to test.

In ""ABRIM"", we have I.

In ""SORAL"", we have O.

Both are good.

But let's see the letters: ""ABRIM"" uses B, I, M. ""SORAL"" uses S, O, L.

S is more common than B? In English, S is very common. O is common, L is common.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""ARMOR"" -> R in position 2: avoid.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters and places A in position 1.

But we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct.

If we guess ""ABRIM"":
- If A is in position 1, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is not in 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

But we also have the feedback from the first guess that R is not in position 2 (which we already know).

So let's choose ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ABRIM"" is a valid English word (meaning bitter).

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But let me confirm: the word must have R in position 3, and A in position 1, and avoid C,N,E,P,T,Y.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). 
- A in 1: we are testing if A is in 1.
- B in 2: new letter.
- R in 3: known.
- I in 4: new letter.
- M in 5: new letter.

This will give us good information.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 1. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

I think it's a good guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""BARON"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""BARRE"": B(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ARMED"": E excluded.

I think ""ABRIM"" is fine.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have feedback that A is not in position 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try ""ALARM"" but we can't because position 3 must be R.

So ""ABRIM"" it is.

But let me check: is ""ABRIM"" accepted? It is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and A in position 4.

If A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

But we don't test position 1 for A.

Similarly, in ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

But ""ABRIM"" tests A in position 1, while ""SORAL"" tests A in position 4.

We can choose either.

I think I'll go with ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

We can then use the next guess to test position 5.

But we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So let's do ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another idea: we can try a word that has A in position 5 and also tests common letters.

For example: ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MANIA"": same.

""RABAT"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so R in position 1 would be wrong? And A in position 2: not allowed.

So I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we can also try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

I think we should go with ""ABRIM"".

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's not there, we get dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 4 or 5 and also tests other letters.

For example, if we get dash for A, then we know A is in 4 or 5, and we can guess a word like ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

Or ""FURAL"" for A in 4.

But we can do that in the next guess.

So ""ABRIM"" is a good middle guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""abrim"".

But let me confirm the word: ""abrim"" is the third person singular of ""abri"", which is a British word for a hut. But it's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

To be safer, we can use ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests A in position 4.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 4. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 1 or 5.

But if we get dash for A in ""SORAL"", then A is not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word like ""ABRIM"" for A in 1, or ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

But ""HORSA"" has A in 5, and we test H, O, S.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" tests A in 1 and B, I, M.

Which is better? Both test three new letters.

But ""ABRIM"" tests I and M, which are vowels, while ""HORSA"" tests H, O, S. O is a vowel, S is common, H is common.

I think both are fine.

But let's look at the feedback we have: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility. We haven't tested position 1 for A.

In ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

In ""SORAL"", we test position 4 for A.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can choose ""ABRIM"" to test position 1.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another word: ""ALARM"" is not because position 3 is A.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good guess.

So the response should be ""abrim"".

But let me write it.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion, we can use ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  

### Key Insights:
- **R** is fixed in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in **position 1, 4, or 5**.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (cannot be used).  
- **Target**: Find a word with R in position 3 and A in position 1, 4, or 5, using new common letters to maximize information.  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test if **A** is in position 1 (via ""abrim""), position 4 (via ""soral""), or position 5 (via ""horsa"").  
- **Why ""abrim""?**  
  - Tests **A in position 1** (a candidate position).  
  - Tests three new common letters: **B, I, M** (not previously used).  
  - Confirms **R in position 3** (expected to be correct).  
  - If **A** is not in position 1, the feedback will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""Soral"" (tests A in position 4 and S/O/L).  
  - ""Horsa"" (tests A in position 5 and H/O/S).  
  - ""Abrim"" is chosen for its commonality and to test vowel/consonant combinations efficiently.  

<guess>abrim</guess>",abrim,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got dash]
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [so R is in position 3!]
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 3.
- The secret word has A, but not in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Also, from guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (but now we know it is in position 3, so that's consistent).

Now, A must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).

We also know the word has A and R (with R fixed at position 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3.
- Has A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, Y.
- We can use other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We should try to test common letters that haven't been tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Position 3 is R: so the word is _ _ R _ _

And A must be in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

Let's try to list possibilities:

Option 1: A in position 1: A _ R _ _
Option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _
Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A _ R _ _
We need two letters for positions 2, 4, and 5. But note: we have only three positions to fill? Actually, position 1 is A, position 3 is R, so positions 2,4,5 are open. But we have two more letters to place? Actually, the word has 5 letters: A, ?, R, ?, ?

We know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a candidate. Then for positions 2,4,5 we need letters that are not in the exclusion list.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Let's try to think of words: A _ R _ _

Possible words: 
- ""AORTA""? But A is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O and T: T is excluded. T is not allowed.
- ""ABRIM""? A (1), B (2), R (3), I (4), M (5). This uses B, I, M. But we don't know if they are in the word. And T is not used? Actually, no T. But we have to avoid T? T is excluded because in guess2 T was x. So ""ABRIM"" is a valid word? It's an adjective meaning bitter, but it's obscure. Maybe not the best.

- ""ACRID""? But C is excluded.

- ""ADORE""? But E is excluded.

- ""AGREE""? E is excluded and duplicate E? Not allowed.

- ""ALARM""? But L is allowed, but we have A in position 1 and then L, A, R, M? Duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, M is allowed. But we have A in position 1 and then A in position 4? That would be A, L, A, R, M? But that's ""ALARM"": A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so that doesn't match. We need position 3 to be R, so ""ALARM"" has A in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But position 3 must be R. So no.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for option 1: A _ R _ _
Possible words:
- ""AURORA"": A(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, U and O are allowed. But we have two R's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we know R is in position 3, so if there is another R, it would be in position 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, ""AURORA"" has E? No, A,U,R,O,R,A? Actually, it's A-U-R-O-R-A? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AURORA"" is 5 letters: A-U-R-O-R-A? No, that's 6. ""AURORA"" is 5: A, U, R, O, R? Then duplicates. But we don't know.

Let me check: ""AURORA"" has two R's. But we don't know if the word has two R's. We only know one R is in position 3.

But we can try? However, we are limited by the letters.

Alternatively, ""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another: ""ADORE"" -> but E is excluded.

""AGREE"" -> E excluded.

""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so not.

It's hard to find a word with A in 1 and R in 3 without using excluded letters.

Try ""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> but position 3 is B, not R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So: A _ R _ _

Possible: 
- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Not allowed? We don't know, but T is excluded so we can't use T.

- ""AUROR"": Not a word? Aurora is 6.

- ""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

It seems difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.

Try option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _

So the word is _ _ R A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

Letters to use: not C,N,E,P,T,Y.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""BORAX"": B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This uses B, O, X. X is not common.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is a word? Foram means a chamber in anatomy. Obscure.

""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word. It means a furrow in geography. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have F, U, L. We don't know if they are in the word.

Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

So the word is _ _ R ? A

We need to fill position 1,2,4.

Example: ""CURIA"": but C is excluded.

""BORIA"": B(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). This is a word? Boria is a geographical term. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have B, O, I.

We can also consider ""FORSA"": not a word.

""HEROA"": not common.

""VERA_"" -> but E is excluded.

It's hard to find common words.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in position 4 or 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we also know that the word has A and R (with R fixed at 3).

We have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters.

For example: ""LORRY"": L(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but Y is excluded, and duplicate R? And Y is not allowed.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> but A cannot be in position 2! We know from guess2 that A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2.

In ""MANOR"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

We must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 2 (but we already know R is not in position 2, and we have R in 3).

So for the word, we have: positions 1,2,4,5 to fill, but with A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We can try ""DOULA"": D(1), O(2), U(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

""VIRGA"": V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), A(5). This is a word (a streak of rain). But we have V, I, G. V is not very common.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> but R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2.

In ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed, and N is excluded.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be in position 4.

Let me search for words with R in position 3 and A in position 4.

For example: ""FURAL"" as I thought earlier: F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a valid word.

Another: ""CURVA"" -> C excluded.

""BURKA"": B(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in position 5, not 4. And we are looking for A in position 4? No, this has A in 5.

We want A in position 4: so the word pattern: _ _ R A _

So position 4 is A.

Example: ""FORAM"" (as before) or ""FURAL"" (as above) or ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word (a type of fish). Valid.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses S, O, L.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

We can also try ""DORAD"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5). Duplicate D? And D is allowed. But ""DORAD"" is a type of fish? Valid.

But let's choose a word that uses more common letters.

Another: ""HORDE"": H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is valid.

But we have F, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Example: ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MARIA"": M(1), A(2) -> same issue.

""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 must be R, so it's R(1), A(2), D(3) -> but we need R(3), so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Examples:
- ""CURIA"" -> C excluded.
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.
- ""FURCA"": F(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), A(5) -> C excluded.

""URALA"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""VIZIR"": V(1), I(2), Z(3) -> position 3 is Z, not R.

It's challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""BORAX"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This has A in position 4.

But X is not common.

""FORAM"" and ""FURAL"" are options.

But let's think of words with A in position 5.

""KARMA"": K(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSA"": P(1) -> but P is excluded.

""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. We need position 3 to be R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Possible: ""CURIA"" is not because of C and position 3 is C.

""TERRA"": T(1) excluded, E(2) excluded.

""ZEBRA"": Z(1), E(2) excluded.

It's very hard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has A in position 4 and uses common letters.

Let me list possible words:

- ""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses F, U, L.
- ""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). Uses F, O, M.
- ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Uses S, O, L.
- ""DORAB"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), B(5). Uses D, O, B.
- ""KORAS"": K(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). Uses K, O, S.

We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K.

""FURAL"" uses F, U, L. F is not very common, U is vowel, L is common.

""SORAL"" uses S, O, L. S and O are common, L is common.

""FORAM"" uses F, O, M. F and O are reasonable.

""DORAB"" uses D, O, B. D and B are common.

""KORAS"" uses K, O, S. K is less common.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice because it uses S, O, L which are common.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to test A in position 5.

But we couldn't find a common word for A in position 5 with R in 3.

Another word for A in position 5: ""TOLYA"" -> T excluded.

""VISTA"": V(1), I(2), S(3) -> position 3 is S, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So let's go with ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and confirms A in position 4.

But we are not testing position 5 for A. We are testing A in position 4.

If we get feedback that A is in the word but not in position 4, then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a good word for A in position 5.

Another word: ""DRAKE"" -> E excluded.

""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""BRAND"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

We are stuck with A in position 4.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

After research: ""LYCRA"": L(1), Y(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.

""SYNRA"": not a word.

""ZEBRA"": E excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good option.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""DURAL"": D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word (relating to the dura mater).

But we have D, U, L.

I think ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's see: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Another word: ""HORSA"": H(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), A(5). This has A in position 5. And S in position 4.

This is a valid word (a type of horse). And it tests H, O, S.

But H and O are reasonable.

However, we are putting A in position 5, which is a candidate.

And we test H, O, S.

But we also have position 4: S.

So ""HORSA"" is a possibility.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: H, O, S are not excluded? Excluded are C,N,E,P,T,Y. So H, O, S are allowed.

Similarly, ""HORSA"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

""SORAL"": tests S, O, L (with A in position 4)
""HORSA"": tests H, O, S (with A in position 5)

Both test O and S. The difference is L vs H.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another word: ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So back to ""SORAL"" or ""HORSA"".

I think ""HORSA"" is less common, but ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's consider: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So if we put A in position 5, and it's not there, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4. But we don't have a good word for position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

But we had trouble.

Another word: ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 3 is H, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

""ABHOR"" is A-B-H-O-R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). So position 3 is H, not R.

Not.

""ALARM"" is A-L-A-R-M -> position 3 is A, not R.

So I think we have to choose between ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

But there is another word: ""DRAKE"" is out because of E.

""GRAPE"" -> E excluded.

""BRASH"": B(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""CRASH"": C excluded.

So let's go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, in ""SORAL"": 
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3 (we know this is correct, so we expect a check for R? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback on S, O, L.)

But we are testing A in position 4.

If A is actually in position 4, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash or if it's not there? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we get a dash for A? No: if A is in the word but not in position 4, we get a dash. If it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so it must be either position 1,4,5. If we put it in 4 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 5. If we put it in 5 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 4. But we don't know which.

But we are trying to find the word.

Another word: ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""JARUL"" -> not a word.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

""LYCRA"" is not.

""SYNCH"" -> C excluded.

""ZEBRA"" -> E excluded.

""UMBRA"": U(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), A(5). Position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""OPERA"": O(1), P(2), E(3) -> E and P excluded.

So I think we should go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, we have another option: ""DURAL"" (relating to the dura mater) -> D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word.

But ""SORAL"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""HORSA"" is also valid.

But ""HORSA"" has A in position 5, which is a candidate.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSH"": P excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SORAL"":
- S: if it's in the word, we get feedback.
- O: same.
- L: same.

And for A: if A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can adjust.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another word: ""GROSS"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So I think ""SORAL"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

For example: ""AROSE"" -> E excluded.

""AROMA"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). This is a valid word. It tests B, I, M.

But we have A in position 1, which is a candidate.

And we test B, I, M.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ABRIM"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, I, M.

But ""ABRIM"" has A in position 1 and R in position 3.

We know R is in position 3, so we are confirming that.

And we test B, I, M.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have the option to test more vowels? We have A already, and we know E is out. So O and I are good to test.

In ""ABRIM"", we have I.

In ""SORAL"", we have O.

Both are good.

But let's see the letters: ""ABRIM"" uses B, I, M. ""SORAL"" uses S, O, L.

S is more common than B? In English, S is very common. O is common, L is common.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""ARMOR"" -> R in position 2: avoid.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters and places A in position 1.

But we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct.

If we guess ""ABRIM"":
- If A is in position 1, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is not in 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

But we also have the feedback from the first guess that R is not in position 2 (which we already know).

So let's choose ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ABRIM"" is a valid English word (meaning bitter).

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But let me confirm: the word must have R in position 3, and A in position 1, and avoid C,N,E,P,T,Y.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). 
- A in 1: we are testing if A is in 1.
- B in 2: new letter.
- R in 3: known.
- I in 4: new letter.
- M in 5: new letter.

This will give us good information.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 1. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

I think it's a good guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""BARON"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""BARRE"": B(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ARMED"": E excluded.

I think ""ABRIM"" is fine.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have feedback that A is not in position 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try ""ALARM"" but we can't because position 3 must be R.

So ""ABRIM"" it is.

But let me check: is ""ABRIM"" accepted? It is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and A in position 4.

If A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

But we don't test position 1 for A.

Similarly, in ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

But ""ABRIM"" tests A in position 1, while ""SORAL"" tests A in position 4.

We can choose either.

I think I'll go with ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

We can then use the next guess to test position 5.

But we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So let's do ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another idea: we can try a word that has A in position 5 and also tests common letters.

For example: ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MANIA"": same.

""RABAT"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so R in position 1 would be wrong? And A in position 2: not allowed.

So I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we can also try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

I think we should go with ""ABRIM"".

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's not there, we get dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 4 or 5 and also tests other letters.

For example, if we get dash for A, then we know A is in 4 or 5, and we can guess a word like ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

Or ""FURAL"" for A in 4.

But we can do that in the next guess.

So ""ABRIM"" is a good middle guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""abrim"".

But let me confirm the word: ""abrim"" is the third person singular of ""abri"", which is a British word for a hut. But it's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

To be safer, we can use ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests A in position 4.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 4. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 1 or 5.

But if we get dash for A in ""SORAL"", then A is not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word like ""ABRIM"" for A in 1, or ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

But ""HORSA"" has A in 5, and we test H, O, S.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" tests A in 1 and B, I, M.

Which is better? Both test three new letters.

But ""ABRIM"" tests I and M, which are vowels, while ""HORSA"" tests H, O, S. O is a vowel, S is common, H is common.

I think both are fine.

But let's look at the feedback we have: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility. We haven't tested position 1 for A.

In ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

In ""SORAL"", we test position 4 for A.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can choose ""ABRIM"" to test position 1.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another word: ""ALARM"" is not because position 3 is A.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good guess.

So the response should be ""abrim"".

But let me write it.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion, we can use ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  

### Key Insights:
- **R** is fixed in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in **position 1, 4, or 5**.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (cannot be used).  
- **Target**: Find a word with R in position 3 and A in position 1, 4, or 5, using new common letters to maximize information.  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test if **A** is in position 1 (via ""abrim""), position 4 (via ""soral""), or position 5 (via ""horsa"").  
- **Why ""abrim""?**  
  - Tests **A in position 1** (a candidate position).  
  - Tests three new common letters: **B, I, M** (not previously used).  
  - Confirms **R in position 3** (expected to be correct).  
  - If **A** is not in position 1, the feedback will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""Soral"" (tests A in position 4 and S/O/L).  
  - ""Horsa"" (tests A in position 5 and H/O/S).  
  - ""Abrim"" is chosen for its commonality and to test vowel/consonant combinations efficiently.",Guess 3: abrim -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) R(✓) I(x) M(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make a second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, N, E (because they are not in the secret word).
   - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

 Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 We can also consider common letters to try to get more information.

 Since we have two known letters (R and A), we can try to place them in different positions.

 Possibilities for R: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to include other common letters to test for their presence. Common consonants besides R include T, S, L, etc., and vowels we have A (already) and we can try O or I.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and also tests other common letters.

 Example words:
 - ""PARTY"": has P, A, R, T, Y. But note: A is in position 2? Actually, in ""PARTY"":
   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)
   However, in our first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but now we are putting R in position 3. That might be okay.
   But we also have to avoid the positions we know: A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so in the secret word A is not in position 3. But in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2, which is allowed.

 However, we must note that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not? We don't know.

 But let's check: if the secret word has R in position 3, then we would get a check (✓) for R. If not, then we get a dash (-) again.

 Also, we are introducing new letters: P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know E is not in the word, so that's okay. However, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T. But note:
   R is in position 1 (which is allowed, since we only know it's not in position 2).
   A is in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we can avoid putting A in position 3.

 Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Another idea: ""RADIO"" -> R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not in position 2 (here it's in 1) and A is not in position 3 (here it's in 2). 
   Also, no C, N, E.

 But we are introducing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   Again, R in 1, A in 2 (which is allowed for A because we only know it's not in 3) and we avoid A in 3.

 However, we don't know if S, P, Y are in the word. We are testing them.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> T (1), R (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). 
   But wait, R is in position 2? We know from the first guess that R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not a good choice because it puts R in position 2.

 Let me try ""ALARM"": A (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, duplicate A? But the word has two A's? 
   Actually, ""ALARM"" has two A's? No: A-L-A-R-M -> that's 5 letters: A, L, A, R, M. 
   But we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, we can avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it's not the correct position, so it would be a waste. We want to test new positions.

 So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.

 Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). 
   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.

 But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). 
   This tests T, I, O.

 Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it's okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). 
   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it's not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.

 So let's avoid position 3 for A.

 After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: 
   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). 
   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don't know if that is correct or not.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). 
   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.

 So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.

 Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). 
   We are testing P, T, Y.

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that is correct.

 Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

 How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). 
   But A is in position 3 -> we know it's not there, so we avoid.

 How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.

 Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.

 How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 We must avoid R in position 2.

 So let's look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

 Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). 
   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We are testing P, I, S.

 But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.

 Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). 
   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it's not in 2). 

 Actually, in ""RASPY"":
   R is in position 1 -> that's a new position, so we can test it.
   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it's not in 3).

 So ""RASPY"" seems good: 
   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.

 But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

 How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).

 So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.

 But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don't know if they are in the word.

 Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".

 However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.

 But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tested and A in a position we haven't tested.

 We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.

 Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.

 How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates? 
   Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.

 However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.

 But ""ALARM"" has two A's. We don't know if that's allowed. So it's safer to avoid duplicates for now.

 So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.

 But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.

 We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). 
   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). 
   We test P, T, Y.

 I think both are good. Let me choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. 
   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.

 In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.

 But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.

 I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.

 But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.

 So let's choose ""PARTY"".

 But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.

 How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.

 How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.

 How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). 
   But duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.

 However, we are testing L and Y.

 But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.

 Let me decide: I'll go with ""PARTY"".

 So the second guess: ""PARTY""

 But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 We are also testing P, T, Y.

 If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

 So the guess is ""party"".

<guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked `-`).
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.
- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, P, Y**) to gather more information.

The word **""party""** fits these criteria:
- **P, T, Y** are new untested letters.
- **R** is placed in position 3 (not position 2).
- **A** is placed in position 2 (not position 3).
- Valid 5-letter English word.

This guess efficiently tests new letters and position constraints while leveraging the known information.

<guess>party</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got dash]
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [so R is in position 3!]
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 3.
- The secret word has A, but not in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Also, from guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (but now we know it is in position 3, so that's consistent).

Now, A must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).

We also know the word has A and R (with R fixed at position 3).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 3.
- Has A in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, Y.
- We can use other letters from the remaining alphabet.

We should try to test common letters that haven't been tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Position 3 is R: so the word is _ _ R _ _

And A must be in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.

Let's try to list possibilities:

Option 1: A in position 1: A _ R _ _
Option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _
Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: A _ R _ _
We need two letters for positions 2, 4, and 5. But note: we have only three positions to fill? Actually, position 1 is A, position 3 is R, so positions 2,4,5 are open. But we have two more letters to place? Actually, the word has 5 letters: A, ?, R, ?, ?

We know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a candidate. Then for positions 2,4,5 we need letters that are not in the exclusion list.

But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Let's try to think of words: A _ R _ _

Possible words: 
- ""AORTA""? But A is repeated? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O and T: T is excluded. T is not allowed.
- ""ABRIM""? A (1), B (2), R (3), I (4), M (5). This uses B, I, M. But we don't know if they are in the word. And T is not used? Actually, no T. But we have to avoid T? T is excluded because in guess2 T was x. So ""ABRIM"" is a valid word? It's an adjective meaning bitter, but it's obscure. Maybe not the best.

- ""ACRID""? But C is excluded.

- ""ADORE""? But E is excluded.

- ""AGREE""? E is excluded and duplicate E? Not allowed.

- ""ALARM""? But L is allowed, but we have A in position 1 and then L, A, R, M? Duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, M is allowed. But we have A in position 1 and then A in position 4? That would be A, L, A, R, M? But that's ""ALARM"": A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so that doesn't match. We need position 3 to be R, so ""ALARM"" has A in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But position 3 must be R. So no.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for option 1: A _ R _ _
Possible words:
- ""AURORA"": A(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, U and O are allowed. But we have two R's? The feedback so far doesn't indicate duplicates, but it's possible. However, we know R is in position 3, so if there is another R, it would be in position 5. But we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, ""AURORA"" has E? No, A,U,R,O,R,A? Actually, it's A-U-R-O-R-A? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AURORA"" is 5 letters: A-U-R-O-R-A? No, that's 6. ""AURORA"" is 5: A, U, R, O, R? Then duplicates. But we don't know.

Let me check: ""AURORA"" has two R's. But we don't know if the word has two R's. We only know one R is in position 3.

But we can try? However, we are limited by the letters.

Alternatively, ""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another: ""ADORE"" -> but E is excluded.

""AGREE"" -> E excluded.

""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so not.

It's hard to find a word with A in 1 and R in 3 without using excluded letters.

Try ""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> but position 3 is B, not R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So: A _ R _ _

Possible: 
- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Not allowed? We don't know, but T is excluded so we can't use T.

- ""AUROR"": Not a word? Aurora is 6.

- ""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

It seems difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.

Try option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _

So the word is _ _ R A _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

Letters to use: not C,N,E,P,T,Y.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

Example: ""BORAX"": B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This uses B, O, X. X is not common.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is a word? Foram means a chamber in anatomy. Obscure.

""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word. It means a furrow in geography. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have F, U, L. We don't know if they are in the word.

Option 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

So the word is _ _ R ? A

We need to fill position 1,2,4.

Example: ""CURIA"": but C is excluded.

""BORIA"": B(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). This is a word? Boria is a geographical term. But we can use it? It's valid.

But we have B, O, I.

We can also consider ""FORSA"": not a word.

""HEROA"": not common.

""VERA_"" -> but E is excluded.

It's hard to find common words.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in position 4 or 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we also know that the word has A and R (with R fixed at 3).

We have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters.

For example: ""LORRY"": L(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but Y is excluded, and duplicate R? And Y is not allowed.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> but A cannot be in position 2! We know from guess2 that A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2.

In ""MANOR"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

We must avoid putting A in position 2.

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 2 (but we already know R is not in position 2, and we have R in 3).

So for the word, we have: positions 1,2,4,5 to fill, but with A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

We can try ""DOULA"": D(1), O(2), U(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.

""VIRGA"": V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), A(5). This is a word (a streak of rain). But we have V, I, G. V is not very common.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> but R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2.

In ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed, and N is excluded.

Another: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that A might be in position 4.

Let me search for words with R in position 3 and A in position 4.

For example: ""FURAL"" as I thought earlier: F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a valid word.

Another: ""CURVA"" -> C excluded.

""BURKA"": B(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in position 5, not 4. And we are looking for A in position 4? No, this has A in 5.

We want A in position 4: so the word pattern: _ _ R A _

So position 4 is A.

Example: ""FORAM"" (as before) or ""FURAL"" (as above) or ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word (a type of fish). Valid.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses S, O, L.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct.

We can also try ""DORAD"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5). Duplicate D? And D is allowed. But ""DORAD"" is a type of fish? Valid.

But let's choose a word that uses more common letters.

Another: ""HORDE"": H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded.

""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is valid.

But we have F, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Example: ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MARIA"": M(1), A(2) -> same issue.

""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 must be R, so it's R(1), A(2), D(3) -> but we need R(3), so not.

We need position 3 to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Examples:
- ""CURIA"" -> C excluded.
- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.
- ""FURCA"": F(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), A(5) -> C excluded.

""URALA"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""VIZIR"": V(1), I(2), Z(3) -> position 3 is Z, not R.

It's challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""BORAX"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This has A in position 4.

But X is not common.

""FORAM"" and ""FURAL"" are options.

But let's think of words with A in position 5.

""KARMA"": K(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSA"": P(1) -> but P is excluded.

""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. We need position 3 to be R.

We need the third letter to be R.

So for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A

Possible: ""CURIA"" is not because of C and position 3 is C.

""TERRA"": T(1) excluded, E(2) excluded.

""ZEBRA"": Z(1), E(2) excluded.

It's very hard.

Perhaps we should try a word that has A in position 4 and uses common letters.

Let me list possible words:

- ""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses F, U, L.
- ""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). Uses F, O, M.
- ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Uses S, O, L.
- ""DORAB"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), B(5). Uses D, O, B.
- ""KORAS"": K(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). Uses K, O, S.

We want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K.

""FURAL"" uses F, U, L. F is not very common, U is vowel, L is common.

""SORAL"" uses S, O, L. S and O are common, L is common.

""FORAM"" uses F, O, M. F and O are reasonable.

""DORAB"" uses D, O, B. D and B are common.

""KORAS"" uses K, O, S. K is less common.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice because it uses S, O, L which are common.

But note: we are putting A in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try to test A in position 5.

But we couldn't find a common word for A in position 5 with R in 3.

Another word for A in position 5: ""TOLYA"" -> T excluded.

""VISTA"": V(1), I(2), S(3) -> position 3 is S, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

So let's go with ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and confirms A in position 4.

But we are not testing position 5 for A. We are testing A in position 4.

If we get feedback that A is in the word but not in position 4, then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But we don't have a good word for A in position 5.

Another word: ""DRAKE"" -> E excluded.

""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""BRAND"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

We are stuck with A in position 4.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

After research: ""LYCRA"": L(1), Y(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.

""SYNRA"": not a word.

""ZEBRA"": E excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good option.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try ""DURAL"": D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word (relating to the dura mater).

But we have D, U, L.

I think ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's see: we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Another word: ""HORSA"": H(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), A(5). This has A in position 5. And S in position 4.

This is a valid word (a type of horse). And it tests H, O, S.

But H and O are reasonable.

However, we are putting A in position 5, which is a candidate.

And we test H, O, S.

But we also have position 4: S.

So ""HORSA"" is a possibility.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: H, O, S are not excluded? Excluded are C,N,E,P,T,Y. So H, O, S are allowed.

Similarly, ""HORSA"" is a valid word.

But we have two options: ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

""SORAL"": tests S, O, L (with A in position 4)
""HORSA"": tests H, O, S (with A in position 5)

Both test O and S. The difference is L vs H.

H is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.

But we can choose either.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

Another word: ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So back to ""SORAL"" or ""HORSA"".

I think ""HORSA"" is less common, but ""SORAL"" is more common.

But let's consider: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So if we put A in position 5, and it's not there, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4. But we don't have a good word for position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

But we had trouble.

Another word: ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 3 is H, not R.

We need position 3 to be R.

""ABHOR"" is A-B-H-O-R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). So position 3 is H, not R.

Not.

""ALARM"" is A-L-A-R-M -> position 3 is A, not R.

So I think we have to choose between ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".

But there is another word: ""DRAKE"" is out because of E.

""GRAPE"" -> E excluded.

""BRASH"": B(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""CRASH"": C excluded.

So let's go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, in ""SORAL"": 
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3 (we know this is correct, so we expect a check for R? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback on S, O, L.)

But we are testing A in position 4.

If A is actually in position 4, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash or if it's not there? But we know A is in the word, so if it's not in position 4, we get a dash for A? No: if A is in the word but not in position 4, we get a dash. If it's not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so it must be either position 1,4,5. If we put it in 4 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 5. If we put it in 5 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 4. But we don't know which.

But we are trying to find the word.

Another word: ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""JARUL"" -> not a word.

I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.

""LYCRA"" is not.

""SYNCH"" -> C excluded.

""ZEBRA"" -> E excluded.

""UMBRA"": U(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), A(5). Position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""OPERA"": O(1), P(2), E(3) -> E and P excluded.

So I think we should go with ""SORAL"".

But wait, we have another option: ""DURAL"" (relating to the dura mater) -> D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.

""DURAL"" is a word.

But ""SORAL"" is more common.

Alternatively, ""HORSA"" is also valid.

But ""HORSA"" has A in position 5, which is a candidate.

We can also consider ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""PARSH"": P excluded.

So I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""SORAL"":
- S: if it's in the word, we get feedback.
- O: same.
- L: same.

And for A: if A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.

But if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can adjust.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another word: ""GROSS"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.

So I think ""SORAL"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O in position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.

For example: ""AROSE"" -> E excluded.

""AROMA"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). This is a valid word. It tests B, I, M.

But we have A in position 1, which is a candidate.

And we test B, I, M.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" is a word.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""ABRIM"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, I, M.

But ""ABRIM"" has A in position 1 and R in position 3.

We know R is in position 3, so we are confirming that.

And we test B, I, M.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But we also have the option to test more vowels? We have A already, and we know E is out. So O and I are good to test.

In ""ABRIM"", we have I.

In ""SORAL"", we have O.

Both are good.

But let's see the letters: ""ABRIM"" uses B, I, M. ""SORAL"" uses S, O, L.

S is more common than B? In English, S is very common. O is common, L is common.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""ARMOR"" -> R in position 2: avoid.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters and places A in position 1.

But we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct.

If we guess ""ABRIM"":
- If A is in position 1, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is not in 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

But we also have the feedback from the first guess that R is not in position 2 (which we already know).

So let's choose ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ABRIM"" is a valid English word (meaning bitter).

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But let me confirm: the word must have R in position 3, and A in position 1, and avoid C,N,E,P,T,Y.

""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). 
- A in 1: we are testing if A is in 1.
- B in 2: new letter.
- R in 3: known.
- I in 4: new letter.
- M in 5: new letter.

This will give us good information.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 1. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 4 or 5.

Similarly, we test B, I, M.

I think it's a good guess.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""BARON"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""BARRE"": B(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ARMED"": E excluded.

I think ""ABRIM"" is fine.

But we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have feedback that A is not in position 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility.

Alternatively, we can try ""ALARM"" but we can't because position 3 must be R.

So ""ABRIM"" it is.

But let me check: is ""ABRIM"" accepted? It is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and A in position 4.

If A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

But we don't test position 1 for A.

Similarly, in ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

But ""ABRIM"" tests A in position 1, while ""SORAL"" tests A in position 4.

We can choose either.

I think I'll go with ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

We can then use the next guess to test position 5.

But we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.

So let's do ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another idea: we can try a word that has A in position 5 and also tests common letters.

For example: ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""MANIA"": same.

""RABAT"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so R in position 1 would be wrong? And A in position 2: not allowed.

So I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice.

But let's see: we can also try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.

I think we should go with ""ABRIM"".

So the guess is ""abrim"".

But note: we are putting A in position 1. If it's not there, we get dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 4 or 5 and also tests other letters.

For example, if we get dash for A, then we know A is in 4 or 5, and we can guess a word like ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

Or ""FURAL"" for A in 4.

But we can do that in the next guess.

So ""ABRIM"" is a good middle guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""abrim"".

But let me confirm the word: ""abrim"" is the third person singular of ""abri"", which is a British word for a hut. But it's accepted in Wordle? I think so.

To be safer, we can use ""SORAL"", which is more common.

""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests A in position 4.

If we get A as check, then we know it's position 4. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word with A in 1 or 5.

But if we get dash for A in ""SORAL"", then A is not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.

Then we can guess a word like ""ABRIM"" for A in 1, or ""HORSA"" for A in 5.

But ""HORSA"" has A in 5, and we test H, O, S.

Similarly, ""ABRIM"" tests A in 1 and B, I, M.

Which is better? Both test three new letters.

But ""ABRIM"" tests I and M, which are vowels, while ""HORSA"" tests H, O, S. O is a vowel, S is common, H is common.

I think both are fine.

But let's look at the feedback we have: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility. We haven't tested position 1 for A.

In ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.

In ""SORAL"", we test position 4 for A.

We don't know which is more likely.

But we can choose ""ABRIM"" to test position 1.

So I'll go with ""ABRIM"".

But wait, we have another word: ""ALARM"" is not because position 3 is A.

I think ""ABRIM"" is a good guess.

So the response should be ""abrim"".

But let me write it.

Alternatively, to avoid confusion, we can use ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  

### Key Insights:
- **R** is fixed in **position 3**.  
- **A** is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in **position 1, 4, or 5**.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (cannot be used).  
- **Target**: Find a word with R in position 3 and A in position 1, 4, or 5, using new common letters to maximize information.  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test if **A** is in position 1 (via ""abrim""), position 4 (via ""soral""), or position 5 (via ""horsa"").  
- **Why ""abrim""?**  
  - Tests **A in position 1** (a candidate position).  
  - Tests three new common letters: **B, I, M** (not previously used).  
  - Confirms **R in position 3** (expected to be correct).  
  - If **A** is not in position 1, the feedback will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - ""Soral"" (tests A in position 4 and S/O/L).  
  - ""Horsa"" (tests A in position 5 and H/O/S).  
  - ""Abrim"" is chosen for its commonality and to test vowel/consonant combinations efficiently.

So it can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to include other common letters to test for their presence. Common consonants besides R include T, S, L, etc., and vowels we have A (already) and we can try O or I.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes R and A, and also tests other common letters.\n\n Example words:\n - ""PARTY"": has P, A, R, T, Y. But note: A is in position 2? Actually, in ""PARTY"":\n   P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5)\n   However, in our first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong, but now we are putting R in position 3. That might be okay.\n   But we also have to avoid the positions we know: A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so in the secret word A is not in position 3. But in ""PARTY"", A is in position 2, which is allowed.\n\n However, we must note that the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 3, that might be correct or not? We don\'t know.\n\n But let\'s check: if the secret word has R in position 3, then we would get a check (✓) for R. If not, then we get a dash (-) again.\n\n Also, we are introducing new letters: P, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"", but we know E is not in the word, so that\'s okay. However, ""ROAST"" has O, A, S, T. But note:\n   R is in position 1 (which is allowed, since we only know it\'s not in position 2).\n   A is in position 3? But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and we got a dash meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? Actually, we can avoid putting A in position 3.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E, and also avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.\n\n Another idea: ""RADIO"" -> R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). \n   This avoids the known bad positions: R is not in position 2 (here it\'s in 1) and A is not in position 3 (here it\'s in 2). \n   Also, no C, N, E.\n\n But we are introducing D, I, O.\n\n Alternatively, ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). \n   Again, R in 1, A in 2 (which is allowed for A because we only know it\'s not in 3) and we avoid A in 3.\n\n However, we don\'t know if S, P, Y are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> T (1), R (2), A (3), I (4), L (5). \n   But wait, R is in position 2? We know from the first guess that R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""TRAIL"" is not a good choice because it puts R in position 2.\n\n Let me try ""ALARM"": A (1), L (2), A (3) -> wait, duplicate A? But the word has two A\'s? \n   Actually, ""ALARM"" has two A\'s? No: A-L-A-R-M -> that\'s 5 letters: A, L, A, R, M. \n   But we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, we can avoid putting A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there? Actually, we can put A in position 3 again? But we know it\'s not the correct position, so it would be a waste. We want to test new positions.\n\n So better to avoid putting A in position 3 and R in position 2.\n\n Let me try ""RAPID"": R (1), A (2), P (3), I (4), D (5). \n   This avoids the bad positions: R is not in 2, A is not in 3.\n\n But we are not testing many common consonants? We are testing P, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATIO"": R (1), A (2), T (3), I (4), O (5). \n   This tests T, I, O.\n\n Another: ""ROAST"" but we cannot use E, so it\'s okay. But in ""ROAST"": R (1), O (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). \n   Here A is in position 3 again -> we know it\'s not there, so we are wasting a position. We should avoid that.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n After considering, I think ""RADIO"" is a good candidate: \n   R (1), A (2), D (3), I (4), O (5). \n   We are testing D, I, O and we have R and A in new positions.\n\n But note: we are putting A in position 2. We don\'t know if that is correct or not.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"": R (1), A (2), I (3), S (4), E (5). \n   However, E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So we cannot use E.\n\n So ""RAISE"" is invalid because of E.\n\n Another word: ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). \n   Here, A is in position 2 (new) and R is in position 3 (which is not position 2, so okay). \n   We are testing P, T, Y.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that is correct.\n\n Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in position 2.\n\n How about ""STARK"": S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), K (5). \n   But A is in position 3 -> we know it\'s not there, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""STARE"": but E is not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARK"" is not good because of A in 3.\n\n Let me try ""BRAWL"": B (1), R (2) -> wait, R in position 2 is not allowed. So avoid.\n\n How about ""DRAWL"": D (1), R (2) -> again R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""GRASP"": G (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n We must avoid R in position 2.\n\n So let\'s look for words that have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n\n Example: ""PARIS"": P (1), A (2), R (3), I (4), S (5). \n   A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed). \n   We are testing P, I, S.\n\n But note: we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\n Another: ""RASPY"": R (1), A (2), S (3), P (4), Y (5). \n   A in 2, R in 1 (which is a new position for R, since we only know it\'s not in 2). \n\n Actually, in ""RASPY"":\n   R is in position 1 -> that\'s a new position, so we can test it.\n   A is in position 2 -> also a new position (we only know it\'s not in 3).\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems good: \n   R in 1, A in 2, and we test S, P, Y.\n\n But note: we are not using T or other common letters? We can always test more letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TRAMP"": T (1), R (2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""TRACK"": but C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word).\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems a valid choice.\n\n But let me check: we are using S, P, Y. We don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\n Another option: ""RAPID"" (as before) or ""RATIO"".\n\n However, I think ""RASPY"" is a good word because it uses common letters and we avoid the known bad positions.\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tested and A in a position we haven\'t tested.\n\n We have only tested R in position 2 and A in position 3. So we can test R in 1,3,4,5 and A in 1,2,4,5.\n\n In ""RASPY"", we are testing R in 1 and A in 2.\n\n Another word: ""ARISE"": but E is not allowed.\n\n How about ""ALARM"": but we have two A\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates? \n   Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicate letters explicitly. But we must be cautious.\n\n However, we know the secret word has R and A, but we don\'t know if they appear more than once. But for now, we assume one occurrence.\n\n But ""ALARM"" has two A\'s. We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. So it\'s safer to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n So ""RASPY"" seems a good choice.\n\n But let me see: we are testing R in position 1 and A in position 2. We also test S, P, Y.\n\n We can also consider ""PARTY"": P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). \n   Here, A is in 2 (allowed) and R is in 3 (allowed). \n   We test P, T, Y.\n\n I think both are good. Let me choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   Since E, N are out, we can try T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n In ""RASPY"", we are testing S, P, Y. Y is less common.\n\n In ""PARTY"", we test P, T, Y. T and Y are common.\n\n But note: we are also testing the position of R and A.\n\n I think ""PARTY"" might be better because T is a very common letter.\n\n But wait: in ""PARTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n However, we are also testing P, T, Y. And we avoid the known bad letters.\n\n So let\'s choose ""PARTY"".\n\n But note: we must ensure that the word is valid. ""PARTY"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" but we cannot because of A in 3? Actually, we can avoid A in 3 by not putting A in 3. In ""ROAST"", A is in 3 -> so we avoid.\n\n Another word: ""TRAIL"" is invalid because of R in 2.\n\n How about ""BRAVE"": B (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""GRACE"": but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""DRAMA"": D (1), R (2) -> R in 2: avoid.\n\n How about ""RALLY"": R (1), A (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). \n   But duplicate L? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are putting R in 1 and A in 2. But we have L and Y.\n\n However, we are testing L and Y.\n\n But I think ""PARTY"" is a solid choice.\n\n Let me decide: I\'ll go with ""PARTY"".\n\n So the second guess: ""PARTY""\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n We are also testing P, T, Y.\n\n If we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\n So the guess is ""party"".\n\n<guess>party</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked `-`).\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid **C, N, E** entirely.\n- Include **R** and **A**, but place them in new positions (not position 2 for R, not position 3 for A).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **T, P, Y**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""party""** fits these criteria:\n- **P, T, Y** are new untested letters.\n- **R** is placed in position 3 (not position 2).\n- **A** is placed in position 2 (not position 3).\n- Valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess efficiently tests new letters and position constraints while leveraging the known information.\n\n<guess>party</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""party""\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)  [since it was in position 2 and got dash]\n- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [so R is in position 3!]\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- Y: x (not in the word)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has R in position 3.\n- The secret word has A, but not in position 2 or 3 (from guess1: not position 3, from guess2: not position 2).\n- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y.\n\nAlso, from guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (but now we know it is in position 3, so that\'s consistent).\n\nNow, A must be in one of the positions: 1, 4, or 5 (since positions 2 and 3 are ruled out).\n\nWe also know the word has A and R (with R fixed at position 3).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in position 3.\n- Has A in position 1, 4, or 5.\n- Does not contain C, N, E, P, T, Y.\n- We can use other letters from the remaining alphabet.\n\nWe should try to test common letters that haven\'t been tried yet. The remaining common letters include: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- Position 3 is R: so the word is _ _ R _ _\n\nAnd A must be in one of the first, fourth, or fifth positions.\n\nLet\'s try to list possibilities:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1: A _ R _ _\nOption 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _\nOption 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with new letters to test.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E, P, T, Y.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: A _ R _ _\nWe need two letters for positions 2, 4, and 5.

Actually, the word has 5 letters: A, ?, R, ?, ?\n\nWe know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a candidate. Then for positions 2,4,5 we need letters that are not in the exclusion list.\n\nBut we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words: A _ R _ _\n\nPossible words: \n- ""AORTA""? But A is repeated? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O and T: T is excluded. T is not allowed.\n- ""ABRIM""? A (1), B (2), R (3), I (4), M (5). This uses B, I, M. But we don\'t know if they are in the word. And T is not used? Actually, no T. But we have to avoid T? T is excluded because in guess2 T was x. So ""ABRIM"" is a valid word? It\'s an adjective meaning bitter, but it\'s obscure. Maybe not the best.\n\n- ""ACRID""? But C is excluded.\n\n- ""ADORE""? But E is excluded.\n\n- ""AGREE""? E is excluded and duplicate E? Not allowed.\n\n- ""ALARM""? But L is allowed, but we have A in position 1 and then L, A, R, M? Duplicate A? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, M is allowed. But we have A in position 1 and then A in position 4? That would be A, L, A, R, M? But that\'s ""ALARM"": A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so that doesn\'t match. We need position 3 to be R, so ""ALARM"" has A in 1, L in 2, A in 3? But position 3 must be R. So no.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R.\n\nSo for option 1: A _ R _ _\nPossible words:\n- ""AURORA"": A(1), U(2), R(3), O(4), R(5) -> duplicate R? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, U and O are allowed. But we have two R\'s? The feedback so far doesn\'t indicate duplicates, but it\'s possible. However, we know R is in position 3, so if there is another R, it would be in position 5. But we don\'t have evidence for duplicates. Also, ""AURORA"" has E? No, A,U,R,O,R,A? Actually, it\'s A-U-R-O-R-A? That\'s 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AURORA"" is 5 letters: A-U-R-O-R-A? No, that\'s 6. ""AURORA"" is 5: A, U, R, O, R? Then duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\nLet me check: ""AURORA"" has two R\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. We only know one R is in position 3.\n\nBut we can try? However, we are limited by the letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\nAnother: ""ADORE"" -> but E is excluded.\n\n""AGREE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> but position 3 is R, so not.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in 1 and R in 3 without using excluded letters.\n\nTry ""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> but position 3 is B, not R.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R.\n\nSo: A _ R _ _\n\nPossible: \n- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Not allowed? We don\'t know, but T is excluded so we can\'t use T.\n\n- ""AUROR"": Not a word? Aurora is 6.\n\n- ""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.\n\nIt seems difficult. Maybe A in position 1 is not common.\n\nTry option 2: A in position 4: _ _ R A _\n\nSo the word is _ _ R A _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nLetters to use: not C,N,E,P,T,Y.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K, etc.\n\nExample: ""BORAX"": B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5).

It means a furrow in geography. But we can use it? It\'s valid.\n\nBut we have F, U, L. We don\'t know if they are in the word.\n\nOption 3: A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nSo the word is _ _ R ? A\n\nWe need to fill position 1,2,4.\n\nExample: ""CURIA"": but C is excluded.\n\n""BORIA"": B(1), O(2), R(3), I(4), A(5). This is a word? Boria is a geographical term. But we can use it? It\'s valid.\n\nBut we have B, O, I.\n\nWe can also consider ""FORSA"": not a word.\n\n""HEROA"": not common.\n\n""VERA_"" -> but E is excluded.\n\nIt\'s hard to find common words.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has A in position 4 or 5 and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we also know that the word has A and R (with R fixed at 3).\n\nWe have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5 and uses common letters.\n\nFor example: ""LORRY"": L(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> but Y is excluded, and duplicate R? And Y is not allowed.\n\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> but A cannot be in position 2! We know from guess2 that A is not in position 2. So we cannot put A in position 2.\n\nIn ""MANOR"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put R in position 2 (but we already know R is not in position 2, and we have R in 3).\n\nSo for the word, we have: positions 1,2,4,5 to fill, but with A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nWe can try ""DOULA"": D(1), O(2), U(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not.\n\n""VIRGA"": V(1), I(2), R(3), G(4), A(5). This is a word (a streak of rain). But we have V, I, G. V is not very common.\n\n""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> but R is in position 2? We know R is not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2.\n\nIn ""URBAN"": U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5) -> but R is in position 2 -> not allowed, and N is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""ORVAN""? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that A might be in position 4.\n\nLet me search for words with R in position 3 and A in position 4.\n\nFor example: ""FURAL"" as I thought earlier: F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""CURVA"" -> C excluded.\n\n""BURKA"": B(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), A(5) -> but A is in position 5, not 4. And we are looking for A in position 4? No, this has A in 5.\n\nWe want A in position 4: so the word pattern: _ _ R A _\n\nSo position 4 is A.\n\nExample: ""FORAM"" (as before) or ""FURAL"" (as above) or ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This is a word (a type of fish). Valid.\n\n""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses S, O, L.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nWe can also try ""DORAD"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), D(5). Duplicate D? And D is allowed. But ""DORAD"" is a type of fish? Valid.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother: ""HORDE"": H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded.\n\n""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). This is valid.\n\nBut we have F, O, M.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nExample: ""MANIA"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""MARIA"": M(1), A(2) -> same issue.\n\n""RADAR"": R(1), A(2), D(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 must be R, so it\'s R(1), A(2), D(3) -> but we need R(3), so not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\nSo for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nExamples:\n- ""CURIA"" -> C excluded.\n- ""DUCAL"": D(1), U(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.\n- ""FURCA"": F(1), U(2), R(3), C(4), A(5) -> C excluded.\n\n""URALA"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""VIZIR"": V(1), I(2), Z(3) -> position 3 is Z, not R.\n\nIt\'s challenging.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word: ""BORAX"" -> B(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), X(5). This has A in position 4.\n\nBut X is not common.\n\n""FORAM"" and ""FURAL"" are options.\n\nBut let\'s think of words with A in position 5.\n\n""KARMA"": K(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""PARSA"": P(1) -> but P is excluded.\n\n""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. We need position 3 to be R.\n\nWe need the third letter to be R.\n\nSo for A in position 5: _ _ R _ A\n\nPossible: ""CURIA"" is not because of C and position 3 is C.\n\n""TERRA"": T(1) excluded, E(2) excluded.\n\n""ZEBRA"": Z(1), E(2) excluded.\n\nIt\'s very hard.\n\nPerhaps we should try a word that has A in position 4 and uses common letters.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""FURAL"": F(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This uses F, U, L.\n- ""FORAM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), M(5). Uses F, O, M.\n- ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Uses S, O, L.\n- ""DORAB"": D(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), B(5). Uses D, O, B.\n- ""KORAS"": K(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). Uses K, O, S.\n\nWe want to test as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, O, I, D, U, M, B, G, H, K.\n\n""FURAL"" uses F, U, L. F is not very common, U is vowel, L is common.\n\n""SORAL"" uses S, O, L. S and O are common, L is common.\n\n""FORAM"" uses F, O, M. F and O are reasonable.\n\n""DORAB"" uses D, O, B. D and B are common.\n\n""KORAS"" uses K, O, S. K is less common.\n\nI think ""SORAL"" is a good choice because it uses S, O, L which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test A in position 5.\n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word for A in position 5 with R in 3.\n\nAnother word for A in position 5: ""TOLYA"" -> T excluded.\n\n""VISTA"": V(1), I(2), S(3) -> position 3 is S, not R.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests S, O, L and confirms A in position 4.\n\nBut we are not testing position 5 for A. We are testing A in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback that A is in the word but not in position 4, then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nBut we don\'t have a good word for A in position 5.\n\nAnother word: ""DRAKE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""GRAVY"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""BRAND"": B(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\nWe are stuck with A in position 4.\n\nSo I think ""SORAL"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.\n\nAfter research: ""LYCRA"": L(1), Y(2), C(3) -> C excluded, and position 3 is C, not R.\n\n""SYNRA"": not a word.\n\n""ZEBRA"": E excluded.\n\nSo I think ""SORAL"" is a good option.\n\nBut note: we are putting O in position 2. We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DURAL"": D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.\n\n""DURAL"" is a word (relating to the dura mater).\n\nBut we have D, U, L.\n\nI think ""SORAL"" is more common.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nAnother word: ""HORSA"": H(1), O(2), R(3), S(4), A(5). This has A in position 5. And S in position 4.\n\nThis is a valid word (a type of horse). And it tests H, O, S.\n\nBut H and O are reasonable.\n\nHowever, we are putting A in position 5, which is a candidate.\n\nAnd we test H, O, S.\n\nBut we also have position 4: S.\n\nSo ""HORSA"" is a possibility.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: H, O, S are not excluded? Excluded are C,N,E,P,T,Y. So H, O, S are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, ""HORSA"" is a valid word.\n\nBut we have two options: ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".\n\n""SORAL"": tests S, O, L (with A in position 4)\n""HORSA"": tests H, O, S (with A in position 5)\n\nBoth test O and S. The difference is L vs H.\n\nH is more common than L? In English, H is more common than L? Actually, L is more common.\n\nBut we can choose either.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\nAnother word: ""GROAN"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.\n\nSo back to ""SORAL"" or ""HORSA"".\n\nI think ""HORSA"" is less common, but ""SORAL"" is more common.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So if we put A in position 5, and it\'s not there, then we know A must be in position 1 or 4. But we don\'t have a good word for position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.\n\nBut we had trouble.\n\nAnother word: ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""ABHOR"": A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5) -> position 3 is H, not R.\n\nWe need position 3 to be R.\n\n""ABHOR"" is A-B-H-O-R -> positions: A(1), B(2), H(3), O(4), R(5). So position 3 is H, not R.\n\nNot.\n\n""ALARM"" is A-L-A-R-M -> position 3 is A, not R.\n\nSo I think we have to choose between ""SORAL"" and ""HORSA"".\n\nBut there is another word: ""DRAKE"" is out because of E.\n\n""GRAPE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""BRASH"": B(1), R(2) -> avoid.\n\n""CRASH"": C excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""SORAL"".\n\nBut wait, in ""SORAL"": \n- S in position 1\n- O in position 2\n- R in position 3 (we know this is correct, so we expect a check for R? But we are guessing, so we will get feedback on S, O, L.)\n\nBut we are testing A in position 4.\n\nIf A is actually in position 4, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash or if it\'s not there? But we know A is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 4, we get a dash for A? No: if A is in the word but not in position 4, we get a dash. If it\'s not in the word? But we know A is in the word, so it must be either position 1,4,5. If we put it in 4 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 5. If we put it in 5 and get dash, then A must be in 1 or 4. But we don\'t know which.\n\nBut we are trying to find the word.\n\nAnother word: ""BARMY"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""JARUL"" -> not a word.\n\nI think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with A in position 5.\n\n""LYCRA"" is not.\n\n""SYNCH"" -> C excluded.\n\n""ZEBRA"" -> E excluded.\n\n""UMBRA"": U(1), M(2), B(3), R(4), A(5). Position 3 is B, not R.\n\nNot.\n\n""OPERA"": O(1), P(2), E(3) -> E and P excluded.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""SORAL"".\n\nBut wait, we have another option: ""DURAL"" (relating to the dura mater) -> D(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). Same as ""FURAL"" but with D.\n\n""DURAL"" is a word.\n\nBut ""SORAL"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, ""HORSA"" is also valid.\n\nBut ""HORSA"" has A in position 5, which is a candidate.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""PARSH"": P excluded.\n\nSo I think ""SORAL"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""SORAL"":\n- S: if it\'s in the word, we get feedback.\n- O: same.\n- L: same.\n\nAnd for A: if A is in position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nBut if we get a dash for A, then we know A is not in position 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.\n\nThen we can adjust.\n\nBut we also want to test other letters.\n\nAnother word: ""GROSS"": G(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""FROWN"": F(1), R(2) -> avoid.\n\nSo I think ""SORAL"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are putting O in position 2. We don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1 and uses common letters.\n\nFor example: ""AROSE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""AROMA"": A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\n""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). This is a valid word. It tests B, I, M.\n\nBut we have A in position 1, which is a candidate.\n\nAnd we test B, I, M.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABRIM"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""ABRIM"" is better because it tests three new letters: B, I, M.\n\nBut ""ABRIM"" has A in position 1 and R in position 3.\n\nWe know R is in position 3, so we are confirming that.\n\nAnd we test B, I, M.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut we also have the option to test more vowels? We have A already, and we know E is out. So O and I are good to test.\n\nIn ""ABRIM"", we have I.\n\nIn ""SORAL"", we have O.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut let\'s see the letters: ""ABRIM"" uses B, I, M. ""SORAL"" uses S, O, L.\n\nS is more common than B? In English, S is very common. O is common, L is common.\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nAnother word: ""ARMOR"" -> R in position 2: avoid.\n\nI think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters and places A in position 1.\n\nBut we are putting A in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nIf we guess ""ABRIM"":\n- If A is in position 1, we get a check for A. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is not in 1, so it must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we test B, I, M.\n\nBut we also have the feedback from the first guess that R is not in position 2 (which we already know).\n\nSo let\'s choose ""ABRIM"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure the word is valid. ""ABRIM"" is a valid English word (meaning bitter).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ABRIM"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must have R in position 3, and A in position 1, and avoid C,N,E,P,T,Y.\n\n""ABRIM"": A(1), B(2), R(3), I(4), M(5). \n- A in 1: we are testing if A is in 1.\n- B in 2: new letter.\n- R in 3: known.\n- I in 4: new letter.\n- M in 5: new letter.\n\nThis will give us good information.\n\nSo the guess is ""abrim"".\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\nIf we get A as check, then we know it\'s position 1. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, we test B, I, M.\n\nI think it\'s a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BARON"": B(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""BARRE"": B(1), A(2) -> avoid.\n\n""ARMED"": E excluded.\n\nI think ""ABRIM"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to consider that we might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ABRIM"".\n\nBut wait, we have feedback that A is not in position 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ALARM"" but we can\'t because position 3 must be R.\n\nSo ""ABRIM"" it is.\n\nBut let me check: is ""ABRIM"" accepted? It is in some dictionaries.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose ""SORAL"", which is more common.\n\n""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5).

If it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.\n\nWe can then use the next guess to test position 5.\n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3.\n\nSo let\'s do ""ABRIM"".\n\nBut wait, we have another idea: we can try a word that has A in position 5 and also tests common letters.\n\nFor example: ""FJORD"": F(1), J(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.\n\nNot.\n\n""MANOR"": M(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.\n\n""MANIA"": same.\n\n""RABAT"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so R in position 1 would be wrong? And A in position 2: not allowed.\n\nSo I think ""ABRIM"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see: we can also try ""DROPS"": but position 3 is P? Not R.\n\nI think we should go with ""ABRIM"".\n\nSo the guess is ""abrim"".\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 1. If it\'s not there, we get dash and then we know A is in 4 or 5.\n\nThen we can guess a word with A in 4 or 5 and also tests other letters.\n\nFor example, if we get dash for A, then we know A is in 4 or 5, and we can guess a word like ""HORSA"" for A in 5.\n\nOr ""FURAL"" for A in 4.\n\nBut we can do that in the next guess.\n\nSo ""ABRIM"" is a good middle guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""abrim"".\n\nBut let me confirm the word: ""abrim"" is the third person singular of ""abri"", which is a British word for a hut. But it\'s accepted in Wordle? I think so.\n\nTo be safer, we can use ""SORAL"", which is more common.\n\n""SORAL"": S(1), O(2), R(3), A(4), L(5). This tests A in position 4.\n\nIf we get A as check, then we know it\'s position 4. If not, we get dash and then A must be in 1 or 5.\n\nThen we can guess a word with A in 1 or 5.\n\nBut if we get dash for A in ""SORAL"", then A is not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5.\n\nThen we can guess a word like ""ABRIM"" for A in 1, or ""HORSA"" for A in 5.\n\nBut ""HORSA"" has A in 5, and we test H, O, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""ABRIM"" tests A in 1 and B, I, M.\n\nWhich is better? Both test three new letters.\n\nBut ""ABRIM"" tests I and M, which are vowels, while ""HORSA"" tests H, O, S. O is a vowel, S is common, H is common.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nBut let\'s look at the feedback we have: we know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3. So position 1 is a possibility. We haven\'t tested position 1 for A.\n\nIn ""ABRIM"", we test position 1 for A.\n\nIn ""SORAL"", we test position 4 for A.\n\nWe don\'t know which is more likely.\n\nBut we can choose ""ABRIM"" to test position 1.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""ABRIM"".\n\nBut wait, we have another word: ""ALARM"" is not because position 3 is A.\n\nI think ""ABRIM"" is a good guess.\n\nSo the response should be ""abrim"".\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid confusion, we can use ""ABRIM"" to test A in position 1.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  \n  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  \n  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  \n\n- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  \n  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  \n  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  \n  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **R** is fixed in **position 3**.  \n- **A** is in the word but **not in positions 2 or 3**, so it must be in **position 1, 4, or 5**.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y (cannot be used).  \n- **Target**: Find a word with R in position 3 and A in position 1, 4, or 5, using new common letters to maximize information.  \n\n### Reasoning for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Test if **A** is in position 1 (via ""abrim""), position 4 (via ""soral""), or position 5 (via ""horsa"").  \n- **Why ""abrim""?**  \n  - Tests **A in position 1** (a candidate position).  \n  - Tests three new common letters: **B, I, M** (not previously used).  \n  - Confirms **R in position 3** (expected to be correct).  \n  - If **A** is not in position 1, the feedback will confirm it must be in 4 or 5.  \n- **Alternatives considered**:  \n  - ""Soral"" (tests A in position 4 and S/O/L).  \n  - ""Horsa"" (tests A in position 5 and H/O/S).  \n  - ""Abrim"" is chosen for its commonality and to test vowel/consonant combinations efficiently.\n\n<guess>abrim</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: party -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) R(✓) T(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: abrim -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) R(✓) I(x) M(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""abrim""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- M: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 1, R in position 3, and M in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.
- From guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (which is consistent with R being in position 3).
- A is in position 1 (so not in position 3 or 2, as previously thought).

So the secret word pattern is: A _ R _ M

We need to fill the second and fourth positions.

The missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.

The letters we have used so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, A, R, I, M, B. But note:
- R and A were already known, and now we have new information.
- We have excluded: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.

So available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a word: A _ R _ M

The second position (position 2) and fourth position (position 4) must be filled with two letters from the available set.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:
- A _ R _ M

Common possibilities:
- A U R A M? But duplicate A? And we have A in position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have M in position 5, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate. But we don't have evidence for duplicates, so we should avoid for now? However, we cannot rule it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not in 3. In the second guess, A was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is not in 2. Now in the third guess, A is in position 1 and got a check, meaning A is in position 1. So A is definitely in position 1. Could there be another A? Possibly, but we have no indication. We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

So let's assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the word is A, ?, R, ?, M

The second letter and fourth letter are to be chosen from: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a valid word.

Let's list possible words:

- A U R A M? But that has two A's. And A is in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if A can be duplicated. Also, ""AURAM"" is not a word.

- A D R A M? Duplicate A? ""ADRAM"" is not a word.

- A G R A M? ""AGRAM"" is not a word.

- A L R A M? ""ALRAM"" not a word.

- A S S M? But we need 5 letters: A _ R _ M. So ""ASSAM"" is 5 but ends with M? ""ASSAM"" is A-S-S-A-M, so positions: A(1), S(2), S(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not. And duplicate S.

Not.

- A D R O M? ""ADROM"" not a word.

- A G R O M? ""AGROM"" not a word.

- A L R O M? ""ALROM"" not a word.

- A S R O M? ""ASROM"" not a word.

- A U R A M? As above, not a word.

- A U R E M? But E is excluded.

- A U R A? Not 5 letters.

We need to find words that end with ""RAM"". But the pattern is A _ R _ M, so the last letter is M, not RAM.

So the word is A ? R ? M

Possible words:
- ""AERIE"" -> but E is excluded and not ending with M.
- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Also, ends with A, not M.

We need words ending with M.

Common words: 
- ""ABRAM"" -> but B is excluded (from guess3, B is x).
- ""ADRAM"" -> not a word.
- ""AGRAM"" -> not a word.
- ""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> position 3 must be R, so not. And duplicate A.

- ""ARMOR"" -> A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: we know R is in position 3, so not. Also, R is already in position 2? But we have R in position 3, so if we put R in position 2, it would be wrong? But we know R is not in position 2, so we cannot put R in position 2.

In ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2), O(3), R(4), O(5) -> but position 3 is O, not R. And R in position 2 and 4: we know R is in position 3, so position 2 and 4 are wrong.

Not.

- ""ARRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AVRAM"" -> not common.

- ""AWRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AZRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AWARE"" -> E excluded.

- ""AURAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AURUM"" -> A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This is a word (a chemical element). But duplicate U? And we test U.

But ""AURUM"" has U in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's see: if we guess ""AURUM"", we are putting U in position 2 and 4. We know position 3 is R and position 5 is M, so we are testing position 2 and 4.

But we have duplicate U.

Alternatively, ""AURUM"" is valid.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: U is not excluded.

Excluded: C,N,E,P,T,Y,B,I. So U is allowed.

But is ""AURUM"" common? It's scientific.

Another word: ""AGRAM"" -> not a word.

""AGRAM"" not.

""ALARM"" is not.

Perhaps ""AWARE"" but E excluded.

I think ""AURUM"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ""AORM?"" -> not.

""ARUM"" is 4 letters.

What about ""ABRIM""? We already tried that, and it had B and I which are excluded now.

We have to use new letters.

Another possibility: ""AURUM"" or ""AURAM"" (not word).

""AVOID"": A(1), V(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""AWARD"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> position 3 is A, not R. And duplicate A.

""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> position 3 is I, not R. And I is excluded.

Not.

""ALOUD"": A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). But position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""AMPLY"": A(1), M(2), P(3) -> P excluded and position 3 is P, not R.

Not.

""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3) -> N excluded and position 3 is V, not R.

Not.

Not.

""ASTER"": A(1), S(2), T(3) -> T excluded and position 3 is T, not R.

Not.

""ATOMS"": A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> but position 3 is O, not R. And T excluded.

Not.

""AVOID"": same issue.

""AWARD"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> duplicate A and position 3 is A, not R.

Not.

""AZOIC"": A(1), Z(2), O(3), I(4), C(5) -> C excluded, position 3 is O, not R, and I and C excluded.

Not.

""DAVIT"": D(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""FAVOR"": F(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""GAMER"": G(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""HAVOC"": H(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""JUMAR"": J(1), U(2), M(3) -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARST"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""LABOR"": L(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""PARIS"": P excluded.

""RASPY"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 1, it would be wrong. And A in position 2: not allowed.

Not.

""ROAST"": R(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed (from guess1, A not in 3), and R in position 1: we know R is in position 3, so not.

Not.

""ROBES"": R(1), O(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""ROWED"": R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5) -> E excluded.

Not.

""RUDDY"": R(1), U(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate D.

Not.

""SAFER"": S(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""SAVOR"": S(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""SOARE"": S(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SOBER"": S(1), O(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""SORES"": S(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), S(5) -> E excluded, and duplicate S? But position 3 is R? Yes, but E is excluded.

Not.

""SORRY"": S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate R.

Not.

""SOUTH"": S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> T excluded, position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2) -> P excluded, and position 3 is P? Not R.

Not.

""SWARM"": S(1), W(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SWAMI"": S(1), W(2), A(3) -> avoid.

""TAWNY"": T excluded.

""UNARM"": U(1), N(2) -> N excluded, and position 3 is N? Not R.

Not.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""USUAL"": U(1), S(2), U(3), A(4), L(5) -> position 3 is U, not R. And A is in position 4? But we have position 3 to fill? This word has A in position 4, but position 3 is U.

Not.

""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WARNS"": W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WASPY"": W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WAYHM"" -> not a word.

""WEARY"": E excluded.

""WHARF"": W(1), H(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""WHAMO"": not a word.

""YARNS"": Y(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ZEBRA"": E excluded.

So after this, we are left with few options.

But we have ""AURUM"": A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This has duplicate U, but it's a valid word.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates.

What about ""AGRAM""? Not a word.

""AGRAM"" not.

""ALARM"" not.

""ALBUM"": A(1), L(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""ALGUM"" -> not a word.

""ALUMM"" -> not.

""AMARM"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"" -> B excluded and E excluded.

""AMORY"": A(1), M(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, and position 3 is O, not R. Also, R is in position 4, but we know R is in position 3, so position 4 would be wrong.

Not.

""ANDROM"" -> not a word.

""ANORM"" -> not.

""APRON"": A(1), P(2), R(3), O(4), N(5) -> P and N excluded.

Not.

""AROM"" is 4 letters.

""AROSE"" -> E excluded.

""ARTIC"": A(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""ASDIC"": A(1), S(2), D(3), I(4), C(5) -> C excluded, position 3 is D, not R.

Not.

""ASSAY"": A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate S, position 3 is S, not R.

Not.

""ASTER"": A(1), S(2), T(3) -> T excluded.

Not.

""ATOMS"": same.

""AVOID"": same.

""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> duplicate A, position 3 is A, not R.

Not.

""AXIOM"": same.

""AZOIC"": same.

""BAKED"": B and E excluded.

""DAVIT"": A(1)? D(1), A(2) -> avoid.

We are stuck with A in position 1.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word I can think of.

But ""AURUM"" has duplicate U. Let's see the pattern: A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So position 2 and 4 are U.

We know position 3 is R and 5 is M, so we are testing U for positions 2 and 4.

If we guess ""AURUM"", and if U is not in the word, we get x for both U's. If one is correct, we get a mix.

But we have to use this.

Another possibility: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"": E excluded.

""AZYME"": same.

""JUMAR"": J(1), U(2), M(3) -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARST"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""RAMIN"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so not.

""RAMEN"": R(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""URAEI"" -> not.

I think ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

But let's confirm the pattern: A _ R _ M

With the second and fourth letters from the available set.

""AURUM"" uses U for position 2 and 4.

But we have duplicate U.

Is there a word without duplicate?

For example, ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""JAZZY"": J(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""KAZOO"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""QUART"": Q(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""QUIRK"": Q(1), U(2), I(3) -> I excluded and position 3 is I, not R.

Not.

""QUORM"" -> not a word.

""SOARE"" -> E excluded.

""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. And we have A in position 4 and R in position 5? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 5, it would be wrong. Also, A in position 4.

But in ""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5). 
- Position 3 is L, not R.
- A is in position 4 (which we are testing) and R in position 5 (which we know is wrong because R is fixed at position 3).

So not.

We need position 3 to be R.

So back to ""AURUM"".

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word I can think of.

But let's consider: ""AURUM"" has U in position 2 and 4. If we guess it, and if the word is ""AURUM"", we win.

But if not, we get feedback.

We have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

So we can try ""AURUM"".

But we might be able to find a word with distinct letters.

What about ""AURUM"" without duplicate? Not possible.

Another word: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""KARST"" -> A not in 2.

I think we have to go with ""AURUM"" or similar.

But there is ""AURUM"", and also ""AURUM"" is the only one.

Another: ""AURUM"" is the only common word.

Perhaps ""AGRAM"" is not, but ""AURUM"" is.

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, with S: ""AURAS"" -> A(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). But duplicate A, and position 5 is S, not M. We need position 5 to be M.

""AURAS"" ends with S, not M.

""ARUMS"" -> A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

Not.

""ASRAM"" -> not a word.

""AVRAM"" -> not.

I think we have to use ""AURUM"" or consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only one I can find.

But there is ""AURUM"", so I'll go with that.

But let's double-check the pattern: A _ R _ M

With the second and fourth letters from the allowed set.

""AURUM"": A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So position 2: U, position 4: U.

But we are testing U for both positions.

If we get U as check or dash, we know.

But we have to use it.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the secret word? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""AURUM"" as a candidate.

But we are not sure.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word.

But let's think of less common words.

""AVOID"" is not.

""FORUM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This is a word (a forum in Rome). And it fits: A is not required? But we have A in position 1? ""FORUM"" is F-O-R-U-M, so it doesn't have A.

We need A in position 1.

So not.

""FORUM"" is F-O-R-U-M, so position 1 is F, not A.

We need position 1 to be A.

So only words starting with A and ending with RM? But ""AURUM"" ends with M.

""AURUM"" is A-U-R-U-M, so it ends with M.

Another word: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""JUMAR"" -> J-U-M-A-R -> but position 3 is M, not R. And it ends with R, not M.

Not.

""KARMA"": K-A-R-M-A -> but position 3 is R? K(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), A(5). So position 2 is A? But we know A is not in position 2 (from guess2, A in position 2 got dash). So we cannot put A in position 2.

In ""KARMA"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""KARAT"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""PARSA"": P excluded.

""SORAM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to go with ""AURUM"".

But let's see if there is a word with S.

For example, ""AURAS"" is not ending with M.

""ARUMS"" -> A(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""ASRAM"" -> not.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits: A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5).

But we have duplicate U.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is accepted in Wordle.

So I'll guess ""AURUM"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 1: A (from guess3, A is ✓)
- Position 3: R (from guess2, R is ✓)
- Position 5: M (from guess3, M is ✓)

So we need positions 2 and 4.

In ""AURUM"", we are testing U for position 2 and 4.

If the word is ""AURUM"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U.

But we might get stuck.

Perhaps there is another word.

Let me search for words: A _ R _ M

With the blank filled with allowed letters.

Allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

And the word must be valid.

""AURUM"" is one.

""AVOID"" is A-V-O-I-D, not ending with M.

""ABHOR"" not.

""ADORE"" E excluded.

""AGREE"" E excluded.

""ALARM"" not.

""ALBUM"" not.

""ALERT"" E excluded.

""ALIKE"" I and E excluded.

""ALOUD"" not.

""AMBER"" B and E excluded.

""AMPLY"" not.

""AMUSE"" E and U in position 3? But position 3 must be R.

""AMUSE"" is A-M-U-S-E -> position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""ANIME"" N and E excluded.

""ANVIL"" N excluded.

""APPLE"" P and E excluded.

""AROMA"" R in position 2: avoid.

""AROSE"" E excluded.

""ARTIC"" R in position 2: avoid.

""ASIAN"" A in position 2: avoid, and N excluded.

""ASSAM"" not ending with M.

""ASTER"" T excluded.

""ATOMS"" not.

""AVOID"" not.

""AWAKE"" duplicate A and position 3 is A.

Not.

""AXIOM"" position 3 is I.

""AZOIC"" position 3 is O, I, C.

Not.

""BAKED"" B and E excluded.

""DAVIT"" N excluded.

""FAVOR"" A in position 2: avoid.

""FORUM"" doesn't have A.

""GAMMA"" -> A not present.

""JUMAR"" -> J-U-M-A-R -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARMA"" A in position 2: avoid.

""KARST"" A in position 2: avoid.

""LOAMY"" L(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""MARSH"" M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""OASIS"" O(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""RAMIN"" R(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""REARM"" E excluded.

""SORRY"" S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate R.

Not.

""SOUTH"" S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> T excluded, position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""SWARM"" S(1), W(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SWAMI"" S(1), W(2), A(3) -> avoid.

""TAWNY"" T excluded.

""UNARM"" U(1), N(2) -> N excluded.

""URBAN"" U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""USUAL"" U(1), S(2), U(3), A(4), L(5) -> position 3 is U, not R. And A in position 4.

But position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""VAPOR"" V(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WARNS"" W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WASPY"" W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WAYHM"" not a word.

""WHARF"" W(1), H(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""WHAMO"" not.

""YARNS"" Y(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ZEBRA"" E excluded.

So I think ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""AURUM"".

But let's see if there is ""AURAM"" or something, but it's not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" E excluded.

""AZYME"" E excluded.

So ""AURUM"" it is.

But in ""AURUM"", position 2 is U and position 4 is U. So if the word is not ""AURUM"", we get feedback on U.

But we might have to use it.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only one.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the word.

But we don't know.

We can also consider ""AURUM"" as a candidate.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  

- **Guess 3: abrim** → Feedback: A(✓), B(x), R(✓), I(x), M(✓)  
  - **B, I** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is confirmed in **position 1** (✓).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  
  - **M** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **A in position 1**, **R in position 3**, and **M in position 5**.  
- The word pattern is: **A _ R _ M**.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters from the available set.  
  - The word must be a valid English word.  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Fill positions 2 and 4 with letters from the available set to solve the word.  
- **Why ""aurum""?**  
  - Fits the pattern **A _ R _ M**.  
  - Uses **U** (position 2 and 4) since it's a common letter not yet tested.  
  - ** Duplicate U**: Allowed, as we don't have evidence of duplicates.  
  - If ""aurum"" is incorrect, the feedback on U will help identify the missing letters.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - No other common 5-letter words fit the pattern and constraints (e.g., ""abrim"" was already tried, ""soral"" was rejected due to B and I exclusion).  
  - ""Aurum"" is a valid word (a chemical element) and uses only allowed letters.  

This guess could be the solution or provide critical feedback for the remaining positions.

<guess>aurum</guess>",aurum,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""party""
- P: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- T: x (not in the word)
- Y: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""abrim""
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- I: x (not in the word)
- M: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So now we know:
- The secret word has A in position 1, R in position 3, and M in position 5.
- The secret word does not contain: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.
- From guess1, we know R is not in position 2 (which is consistent with R being in position 3).
- A is in position 1 (so not in position 3 or 2, as previously thought).

So the secret word pattern is: A _ R _ M

We need to fill the second and fourth positions.

The missing letters must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the known absent letters: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.

The letters we have used so far: C, R, A, N, E, P, A, R, I, M, B. But note:
- R and A were already known, and now we have new information.
- We have excluded: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I.

So available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to form a word: A _ R _ M

The second position (position 2) and fourth position (position 4) must be filled with two letters from the available set.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:
- A _ R _ M

Common possibilities:
- A U R A M? But duplicate A? And we have A in position 1 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have M in position 5, so if we put A in position 4, that would be a duplicate. But we don't have evidence for duplicates, so we should avoid for now? However, we cannot rule it out.

But note: in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is in the word but not in 3. In the second guess, A was in position 2 and got a dash, meaning A is not in 2. Now in the third guess, A is in position 1 and got a check, meaning A is in position 1. So A is definitely in position 1. Could there be another A? Possibly, but we have no indication. We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

So let's assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the word is A, ?, R, ?, M

The second letter and fourth letter are to be chosen from: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a valid word.

Let's list possible words:

- A U R A M? But that has two A's. And A is in position 1 and 4. But we don't know if A can be duplicated. Also, ""AURAM"" is not a word.

- A D R A M? Duplicate A? ""ADRAM"" is not a word.

- A G R A M? ""AGRAM"" is not a word.

- A L R A M? ""ALRAM"" not a word.

- A S S M? But we need 5 letters: A _ R _ M. So ""ASSAM"" is 5 but ends with M? ""ASSAM"" is A-S-S-A-M, so positions: A(1), S(2), S(3) -> but position 3 must be R, so not. And duplicate S.

Not.

- A D R O M? ""ADROM"" not a word.

- A G R O M? ""AGROM"" not a word.

- A L R O M? ""ALROM"" not a word.

- A S R O M? ""ASROM"" not a word.

- A U R A M? As above, not a word.

- A U R E M? But E is excluded.

- A U R A? Not 5 letters.

We need to find words that end with ""RAM"". But the pattern is A _ R _ M, so the last letter is M, not RAM.

So the word is A ? R ? M

Possible words:
- ""AERIE"" -> but E is excluded and not ending with M.
- ""AORTA"" -> A(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), A(5) -> but T is excluded, and duplicate A? Also, ends with A, not M.

We need words ending with M.

Common words: 
- ""ABRAM"" -> but B is excluded (from guess3, B is x).
- ""ADRAM"" -> not a word.
- ""AGRAM"" -> not a word.
- ""ALARM"" -> A(1), L(2), A(3) -> position 3 must be R, so not. And duplicate A.

- ""ARMOR"" -> A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: we know R is in position 3, so not. Also, R is already in position 2? But we have R in position 3, so if we put R in position 2, it would be wrong? But we know R is not in position 2, so we cannot put R in position 2.

In ""ARMOR"": A(1), R(2), O(3), R(4), O(5) -> but position 3 is O, not R. And R in position 2 and 4: we know R is in position 3, so position 2 and 4 are wrong.

Not.

- ""ARRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AVRAM"" -> not common.

- ""AWRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AZRAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AWARE"" -> E excluded.

- ""AURAM"" -> not a word.

- ""AURUM"" -> A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This is a word (a chemical element). But duplicate U? And we test U.

But ""AURUM"" has U in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's see: if we guess ""AURUM"", we are putting U in position 2 and 4. We know position 3 is R and position 5 is M, so we are testing position 2 and 4.

But we have duplicate U.

Alternatively, ""AURUM"" is valid.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: U is not excluded.

Excluded: C,N,E,P,T,Y,B,I. So U is allowed.

But is ""AURUM"" common? It's scientific.

Another word: ""AGRAM"" -> not a word.

""AGRAM"" not.

""ALARM"" is not.

Perhaps ""AWARE"" but E excluded.

I think ""AURUM"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there are more common words.

Another: ""AORM?"" -> not.

""ARUM"" is 4 letters.

What about ""ABRIM""? We already tried that, and it had B and I which are excluded now.

We have to use new letters.

Another possibility: ""AURUM"" or ""AURAM"" (not word).

""AVOID"": A(1), V(2), O(3) -> position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""AWARD"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> position 3 is A, not R. And duplicate A.

""AXIOM"": A(1), X(2), I(3) -> position 3 is I, not R. And I is excluded.

Not.

""ALOUD"": A(1), L(2), O(3), U(4), D(5). But position 3 is O, not R.

Not.

""AMBER"": A(1), M(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""AMPLY"": A(1), M(2), P(3) -> P excluded and position 3 is P, not R.

Not.

""ANVIL"": A(1), N(2), V(3) -> N excluded and position 3 is V, not R.

Not.

""ASTER"": A(1), S(2), T(3) -> T excluded and position 3 is T, not R.

Not.

""ATOMS"": A(1), T(2), O(3), M(4), S(5) -> but position 3 is O, not R. And T excluded.

Not.

""AVOID"": same issue.

""AWARD"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> duplicate A and position 3 is A, not R.

Not.

""GAMER"": G(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""HAVOC"": H(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""JUMAR"": J(1), U(2), M(3) -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARST"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""LABOR"": L(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""LAIRD"": L(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""PARIS"": P excluded.

""RASPY"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 1, it would be wrong. And A in position 2: not allowed.

Not.

""ROAST"": R(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed (from guess1, A not in 3), and R in position 1: we know R is in position 3, so not.

Not.

""ROBES"": R(1), O(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""ROWED"": R(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), D(5) -> E excluded.

Not.

""RUDDY"": R(1), U(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate D.

Not.

""SAFER"": S(1), A(2) -> A in position 2: not allowed.

""SAVOR"": S(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""SOARE"": S(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SOBER"": S(1), O(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""SORES"": S(1), O(2), R(3), E(4), S(5) -> E excluded, and duplicate S? But position 3 is R? Yes, but E is excluded.

Not.

""SORRY"": S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate R.

Not.

""SOUTH"": S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> T excluded, position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""SPRIG"": S(1), P(2) -> P excluded, and position 3 is P? Not R.

Not.

""SWARM"": S(1), W(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SWAMI"": S(1), W(2), A(3) -> avoid.

""TAWNY"": T excluded.

""UNARM"": U(1), N(2) -> N excluded, and position 3 is N? Not R.

Not.

""URBAN"": U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""USUAL"": U(1), S(2), U(3), A(4), L(5) -> position 3 is U, not R. And A is in position 4? But we have position 3 to fill? This word has A in position 4, but position 3 is U.

Not.

""VAPOR"": V(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WARNS"": W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WASPY"": W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WAYHM"" -> not a word.

""WEARY"": E excluded.

""WHARF"": W(1), H(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""WHAMO"": not a word.

""YARNS"": Y(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ZEBRA"": E excluded.

So after this, we are left with few options.

But we have ""AURUM"": A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This has duplicate U, but it's a valid word.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicates.

What about ""AGRAM""? Not a word.

""AGRAM"" not.

""ALARM"" not.

""ALBUM"": A(1), L(2), B(3) -> B excluded and position 3 is B, not R.

Not.

""ALGUM"" -> not a word.

""ALUMM"" -> not.

""AMARM"" -> not a word.

""AMBER"" -> B excluded and E excluded.

""AMORY"": A(1), M(2), O(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, and position 3 is O, not R. Also, R is in position 4, but we know R is in position 3, so position 4 would be wrong.

Not.

""ANDROM"" -> not a word.

""ANORM"" -> not.

""APRON"": A(1), P(2), R(3), O(4), N(5) -> P and N excluded.

Not.

""AROM"" is 4 letters.

""AROSE"" -> E excluded.

""ARTIC"": A(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""ASDIC"": A(1), S(2), D(3), I(4), C(5) -> C excluded, position 3 is D, not R.

Not.

""ASSAY"": A(1), S(2), S(3), A(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate S, position 3 is S, not R.

Not.

""ASTER"": A(1), S(2), T(3) -> T excluded.

Not.

""ATOMS"": same.

""AVOID"": same.

""AWAKE"": A(1), W(2), A(3) -> duplicate A, position 3 is A, not R.

Not.

""AXIOM"": same.

""AZOIC"": same.

""BAKED"": B and E excluded.

""DAVIT"": A(1)? D(1), A(2) -> avoid.

We are stuck with A in position 1.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word I can think of.

But ""AURUM"" has duplicate U. Let's see the pattern: A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So position 2 and 4 are U.

We know position 3 is R and 5 is M, so we are testing U for positions 2 and 4.

If we guess ""AURUM"", and if U is not in the word, we get x for both U's. If one is correct, we get a mix.

But we have to use this.

Another possibility: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"": E excluded.

""AZYME"": same.

""JUMAR"": J(1), U(2), M(3) -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARST"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""OASIS"": O(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""RAMIN"": R(1), A(2) -> R in position 1? But we know R is in position 3, so not.

""RAMEN"": R(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""URAEI"" -> not.

I think ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

But let's confirm the pattern: A _ R _ M

With the second and fourth letters from the available set.

""AURUM"" uses U for position 2 and 4.

But we have duplicate U.

Is there a word without duplicate?

For example, ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""JAZZY"": J(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""KAZOO"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""QUART"": Q(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""QUIRK"": Q(1), U(2), I(3) -> I excluded and position 3 is I, not R.

Not.

""QUORM"" -> not a word.

""SOARE"" -> E excluded.

""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5) -> but position 3 is L, not R. And we have A in position 4 and R in position 5? But we know R is in position 3, so if we put R in position 5, it would be wrong. Also, A in position 4.

But in ""SOLAR"": S(1), O(2), L(3), A(4), R(5). 
- Position 3 is L, not R.
- A is in position 4 (which we are testing) and R in position 5 (which we know is wrong because R is fixed at position 3).

So not.

We need position 3 to be R.

So back to ""AURUM"".

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word I can think of.

But let's consider: ""AURUM"" has U in position 2 and 4. If we guess it, and if the word is ""AURUM"", we win.

But if not, we get feedback.

We have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

So we can try ""AURUM"".

But we might be able to find a word with distinct letters.

What about ""AURUM"" without duplicate? Not possible.

Another word: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""KARST"" -> A not in 2.

I think we have to go with ""AURUM"" or similar.

But there is ""AURUM"", and also ""AURUM"" is the only one.

Another: ""AURUM"" is the only common word.

Perhaps ""AGRAM"" is not, but ""AURUM"" is.

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, with S: ""AURAS"" -> A(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), S(5). But duplicate A, and position 5 is S, not M. We need position 5 to be M.

""AURAS"" ends with S, not M.

""ARUMS"" -> A(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

Not.

""ASRAM"" -> not a word.

""AVRAM"" -> not.

I think we have to use ""AURUM"" or consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only one I can find.

But there is ""AURUM"", so I'll go with that.

But let's double-check the pattern: A _ R _ M

With the second and fourth letters from the allowed set.

""AURUM"": A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). So position 2: U, position 4: U.

But we are testing U for both positions.

If we get U as check or dash, we know.

But we have to use it.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the secret word? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""AURUM"" as a candidate.

But we are not sure.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only common word.

But let's think of less common words.

""AVOID"" is not.

""FORUM"": F(1), O(2), R(3), U(4), M(5). This is a word (a forum in Rome). And it fits: A is not required? But we have A in position 1? ""FORUM"" is F-O-R-U-M, so it doesn't have A.

We need A in position 1.

So not.

""FORUM"" is F-O-R-U-M, so position 1 is F, not A.

We need position 1 to be A.

So only words starting with A and ending with RM? But ""AURUM"" ends with M.

""AURUM"" is A-U-R-U-M, so it ends with M.

Another word: ""AURAM"" is not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" -> E excluded.

""AZYME"" -> E excluded.

""JUMAR"" -> J-U-M-A-R -> but position 3 is M, not R. And it ends with R, not M.

Not.

""KARMA"": K-A-R-M-A -> but position 3 is R? K(1), A(2), R(3), M(4), A(5). So position 2 is A? But we know A is not in position 2 (from guess2, A in position 2 got dash). So we cannot put A in position 2.

In ""KARMA"": A is in position 2 -> not allowed.

Similarly, ""KARAT"": K(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""MARSH"": M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""PARSA"": P excluded.

""SORAM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to go with ""AURUM"".

But let's see if there is a word with S.

For example, ""AURAS"" is not ending with M.

""ARUMS"" -> A(1), R(2) -> avoid.

""ASRAM"" -> not.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits: A(1), U(2), R(3), U(4), M(5).

But we have duplicate U.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is accepted in Wordle.

So I'll guess ""AURUM"".

But let's confirm the feedback we have.

We know:
- Position 1: A (from guess3, A is ✓)
- Position 3: R (from guess2, R is ✓)
- Position 5: M (from guess3, M is ✓)

So we need positions 2 and 4.

In ""AURUM"", we are testing U for position 2 and 4.

If the word is ""AURUM"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U.

But we might get stuck.

Perhaps there is another word.

Let me search for words: A _ R _ M

With the blank filled with allowed letters.

Allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

And the word must be valid.

""AURUM"" is one.

""AVOID"" is A-V-O-I-D, not ending with M.

""ABHOR"" not.

""ADORE"" E excluded.

""AGREE"" E excluded.

""ALARM"" not.

""ALBUM"" not.

""ALERT"" E excluded.

""ALIKE"" I and E excluded.

""ALOUD"" not.

""AMBER"" B and E excluded.

""AMPLY"" not.

""AMUSE"" E and U in position 3? But position 3 must be R.

""AMUSE"" is A-M-U-S-E -> position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""ANIME"" N and E excluded.

""ANVIL"" N excluded.

""APPLE"" P and E excluded.

""AROMA"" R in position 2: avoid.

""AROSE"" E excluded.

""ARTIC"" R in position 2: avoid.

""ASIAN"" A in position 2: avoid, and N excluded.

""ASSAM"" not ending with M.

""ASTER"" T excluded.

""ATOMS"" not.

""AVOID"" not.

""AWAKE"" duplicate A and position 3 is A.

Not.

""AXIOM"" position 3 is I.

""AZOIC"" position 3 is O, I, C.

Not.

""BAKED"" B and E excluded.

""DAVIT"" N excluded.

""FAVOR"" A in position 2: avoid.

""FORUM"" doesn't have A.

""GAMMA"" -> A not present.

""JUMAR"" -> J-U-M-A-R -> position 3 is M, not R.

Not.

""KARMA"" A in position 2: avoid.

""KARST"" A in position 2: avoid.

""LOAMY"" L(1), O(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""MARSH"" M(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""OASIS"" O(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""RAMIN"" R(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""REARM"" E excluded.

""SORRY"" S(1), O(2), R(3), R(4), Y(5) -> Y excluded, duplicate R.

Not.

""SOUTH"" S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5) -> T excluded, position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""SWARM"" S(1), W(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""SWAMI"" S(1), W(2), A(3) -> avoid.

""TAWNY"" T excluded.

""UNARM"" U(1), N(2) -> N excluded.

""URBAN"" U(1), R(2) -> R in position 2: avoid.

""USUAL"" U(1), S(2), U(3), A(4), L(5) -> position 3 is U, not R. And A in position 4.

But position 3 is U, not R.

Not.

""VAPOR"" V(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WARNS"" W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WASPY"" W(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""WAYHM"" not a word.

""WHARF"" W(1), H(2), A(3) -> A in position 3: not allowed.

""WHAMO"" not.

""YARNS"" Y(1), A(2) -> avoid.

""ZEBRA"" E excluded.

So I think ""AURUM"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""AURUM"".

But let's see if there is ""AURAM"" or something, but it's not a word.

""AVRAM"" not.

""AWRAM"" not.

""AZRAM"" not.

""AZURE"" E excluded.

""AZYME"" E excluded.

So ""AURUM"" it is.

But in ""AURUM"", position 2 is U and position 4 is U. So if the word is not ""AURUM"", we get feedback on U.

But we might have to use it.

Another word: ""AURUM"" is the only one.

Perhaps ""AURUM"" is the word.

But we don't know.

We can also consider ""AURUM"" as a candidate.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)  
  - **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **R** is in the word but **not in position 2**.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 3**.  

- **Guess 2: party** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), R(✓), T(x), Y(x)  
  - **P, T, Y** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is in the word but **not in position 2** (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  

- **Guess 3: abrim** → Feedback: A(✓), B(x), R(✓), I(x), M(✓)  
  - **B, I** are **not** in the secret word.  
  - **A** is confirmed in **position 1** (✓).  
  - **R** is confirmed in **position 3** (✓).  
  - **M** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **A in position 1**, **R in position 3**, and **M in position 5**.  
- The word pattern is: **A _ R _ M**.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, N, E, P, T, Y, B, I (cannot be used).  
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters from the available set.  
  - The word must be a valid English word.  

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Fill positions 2 and 4 with letters from the available set to solve the word.  
- **Why ""aurum""?**  
  - Fits the pattern **A _ R _ M**.  
  - Uses **U** (position 2 and 4) since it's a common letter not yet tested.  
  - ** Duplicate U**: Allowed, as we don't have evidence of duplicates.  
  - If ""aurum"" is incorrect, the feedback on U will help identify the missing letters.  
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - No other common 5-letter words fit the pattern and constraints (e.g., ""abrim"" was already tried, ""soral"" was rejected due to B and I exclusion).  
  - ""Aurum"" is a valid word (a chemical element) and uses only allowed letters.  

This guess could be the solution or provide critical feedback for the remaining positions.",Guess 4: aurum -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(✓) R(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
