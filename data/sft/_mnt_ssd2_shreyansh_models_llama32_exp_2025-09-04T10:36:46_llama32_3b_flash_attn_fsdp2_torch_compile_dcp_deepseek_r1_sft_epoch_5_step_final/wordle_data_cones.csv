We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letter 'C' is in the word and is the first letter. So the secret word starts with 'C'.
- The letters 'R' and 'A' are not in the word at all.
- The letters 'N' and 'E' are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (so 'N' is not the fourth letter, and 'E' is not the fifth).

Since the word starts with 'C', we can write: C _ _ _ _

We also know that the word contains 'N' and 'E', but not in the positions we had in ""crane"". In ""crane"", 'N' was in the fourth position and 'E' in the fifth. So in the secret word:
- 'N' cannot be at position 4.
- 'E' cannot be at position 5.

Additionally, we must avoid using 'R' and 'A' because they are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is fixed as 'C')
- Includes 'N' and 'E' (because they are in the word) but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does not include 'R' or 'A'.
- We can use other letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'N' and 'E', and avoid 'R' and 'A'.

Possible positions for 'N' and 'E':
- 'N' can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and not 1 because that's C).
- 'E' can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 1 is C.

We also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: C, N, E, and two more letters.

We need to choose a word that uses 'N' and 'E' in different positions and includes two new letters.

Let's try to think of common words that start with C and have N and E.

Some possibilities:
- ""CINE"" is only 4 letters, so not 5.
- ""CONE"" has O and N, but we don't know about O. Also, in ""crane"", we had N at position 4, but in ""cone"", N is at position 3? Let's check: C O N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:?. But we know from feedback that in the secret word, N is not at position 4 (from our guess) but in ""cone"", N is at position 3, which is allowed. However, we also have E at position 4. But in our feedback, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are putting E at position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. It could be at position 4.

But note: we must avoid using R and A. ""cone"" doesn't have R or A, so it's okay.

However, we have two new letters: O and the fifth letter. We don't know about O.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'N' and 'E' in positions we haven't tried.

In our first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (correct)
Position 2: R (absent) -> so position 2 is not R, but we don't know what it is.
Position 3: A (absent) -> not A.
Position 4: N (present but wrong position) -> so in the secret word, position 4 is not N.
Position 5: E (present but wrong position) -> so position 5 is not E.

Now, for the second guess, we can try to put 'N' in a new position and 'E' in a new position.

For example, we can try to put 'N' at position 2 and 'E' at position 3? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Let me list some words that start with C, have N and E, and avoid R and A.

Possible words:
- ""CONE"": C O N E ? -> but we have to avoid the known absent letters. It has O and the fifth letter (which we don't know). Also, in ""cone"", N is at position 3 and E at position 4. This might be a candidate.

But note: we have to consider that the feedback for 'N' was that it is in the word but not at position 4. In ""cone"", N is at position 3, which is fine. Similarly, E is at position 4, which is not position 5, so that's allowed.

Another word: ""CINEW"" (meaning: a tendon) -> C I N E W. This has I, N, E, W. But we don't know about I and W. Also, positions: N is at 3, E at 4.

But we can also try to use a word that has 'N' and 'E' in positions we haven't tried, such as position 2 and 3, or 2 and 5, etc.

However, we must also consider that we have two more letters to discover.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has the 'N' and 'E' in different positions and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that start with C, have N and E, and avoid R and A.

Some options:
- ""CONE"" (as above) -> C O N E ?
- ""CINED"" (but that's 5 letters? C I N E D -> but that's 5: C, I, N, E, D). But we don't know if D is in the word. Also, in this word, N is at position 3 and E at position 4? Wait: positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D.

But we have to avoid R and A, which we are.

Another option: ""CHINE"" (a type of worker) -> C H I N E. This has H and I. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, in this word, N is at position 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 in our second guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback already told us that position 4 is not N. So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in ""CHINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Similarly, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for ""CHINE"", if we use it, we would be putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (also wrong). So that would be inefficient because we already know those positions are wrong.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has N in a position that is not 4, and E in a position that is not 5.

Let me try to find words that have N in position 2, 3, or 5 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: we can put N? Yes, but then we have to avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we can put N at position 2, but then we have to see if it's correct. But we don't know. We can try.

But note: we also have to include E. Let's put E at position 3? Then we have C _ E _ _ and we need N somewhere (not position 4). So we can put N at position 2? Then we have C N E _ _. What letters for positions 4 and 5? We need two letters that are not R or A.

For example: ""CNEPT"" is not a word. ""CNED"" is not 5 letters. 

Alternatively, we can put N at position 5? Then we have C _ _ _ N, and E somewhere (not position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4). But position 5 is N, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

Example: ""CUBEN"" (a type of deer) -> C U B E N. This has U and B. Positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:N. 
But note: E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and N at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). Also, we avoid R and A.

But is ""CUBEN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let me think of common words.

Another common word: ""CONEY"" -> but that has O and Y. And it ends with Y. But we don't know about O and Y. Also, in ""cone"", we have O and then N at 3 and E at 4. But we can use that.

But let's look for a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""CLINE"" (a term in geography) -> C L I N E. But then N is at position 4? Position 4 is N, which we know is wrong. So avoid.

""CNIDE"" (to scorn) -> C N I D E. This has N at position 2, which is new. And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, ""CNIDE"" is invalid for E position.

We must avoid putting E at position 5.

So let's try to put E at position 4? Then we have C _ _ E _ and N somewhere (not position 4). So if we put N at position 2, then we have C N ? E ? -> but then we need two more letters. What about ""CNITE""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put N at position 3 and E at position 4: then we have C _ N E _. What words? For example: ""CINE"" is 4 letters. ""CINCH"" has I and H, but also two N's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback didn't indicate duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""CUBES"" -> C U B E S. This has U, B, E, S. Positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:S. 
But we are putting E at position 4 (which is allowed) and S at position 5. Also, we avoid R and A. This seems okay.

But we also have to consider that we need to test new letters. We haven't tested S, U, B, etc.

Another common word: ""CONED"" -> C O N E D. This has O and D. Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. 
But wait, we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, but now we are putting N at position 3. That's a new position, so it's okay. Similarly, E at position 4 is new (we only know it's not at 5). 

But note: in ""CONED"", we have O and D. We don't know about O and D.

Also, we avoid R and A.

So ""CONED"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if it meets the criteria:
- Starts with C: yes.
- Has N and E: yes, at positions 3 and 4.
- Avoids R and A: yes.
- We are testing O and D.

Alternatively, we can try ""CONE"" (which is a common word) -> C O N E ?. But we have to fill the last letter. We can use a variety of letters. But note: we have to avoid R and A. Also, we know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to choose a word with 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, ""CONE"" has 4 letters? No, ""CONE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

""CONE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with C, having N and E, and avoiding R and A.

Some options:
- ""CONED"" (as above) -> C O N E D
- ""CUBED"" -> C U B E D -> but then we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include both N and E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Another: ""CINCH"" -> C I N C H -> but has two C's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we already know the first letter is C, so if we put C again, it might be redundant. But it's allowed. However, we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.

""CLINE"" is invalid because N is at position 4.

""CNIDE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

""CONED"" seems okay.

But let me see if there's a word that puts N at position 2 and E at position 3? For example: ""CNEZE"" is not a word.

""CNEMA"" is not 5 letters and has A which is absent.

Another: ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

""CONES"" -> C O N E S -> but then E is at position 4 and S at position 5. This word has E at position 4 (allowed) and N at position 3 (allowed). Also, avoids R and A. And it's a common word.

So ""CONES"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""CONES"", we have O and S. We don't know about O and S.

Alternatively, ""CUBES"" has E at position 4 and S at position 5.

But let's compare:

Option 1: ""CONED"" -> C O N E D
Option 2: ""CONES"" -> C O N E S

Both are valid. Which one gives more information?

We know the secret word has an 'N' that is not at position 4, and an 'E' that is not at position 5. In ""CONED"", we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4. In ""CONES"", we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4 as well.

But note: in ""CONED"", we are also testing O and D. In ""CONES"", we are testing O and S.

We might prefer S over D because S is a very common letter.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have S or D.

Another candidate: ""CINES"" (plural of cinch) -> C I N E S -> but then N is at position 3 and E at position 4? Positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. This avoids R and A. And we test I and S.

But we don't know if I is in the word.

Alternatively, ""CONE"" is 4 letters, so not valid.

Another 5-letter word: ""CAMEO"" -> but has A? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A.

So let's list:

- ""CONED"": C O N E D -> tests O and D, and puts N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CONES"": C O N E S -> tests O and S, and same positions.
- ""CINES"": C I N E S -> tests I and S, and N at 3, E at 4.

We can also consider putting N at position 5? For example, ""CUBEN"" (if accepted) or ""CUBES"" (but that has E at position 4 and S at 5). ""CUBES"" is a word: C U B E S -> E at 4, S at 5.

But we don't have N in this word? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include both N and E.

So we must have both N and E in the guess.

Therefore, we need a word that has both.

Another word: ""CNIDE"" is not a word.

""CNPLE"" not a word.

""CNUT"" is 4 letters.

So the main candidates are:

- ""CONED"": tests O, D, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CONES"": tests O, S, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CINES"": tests I, S, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.

We can also consider ""CONE"" is 4, so no.

Another: ""CAMEL"" -> but has A? No, A is absent. So we cannot use A.

""CELLO"" -> but no N? We must include N.

So I think ""CONED"", ""CONES"", and ""CINES"" are candidates.

But note: we have two more letters to find, and we are testing two new letters in each.

We might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no indication so far.

Given that, I think ""CONES"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

But let me check: in ""CONES"", we are putting O at position 2, N at 3, E at 4, and S at 5. We also know that the secret word has an N that is not at 4 and an E that is not at 5. In ""CONES"", N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5), so that's consistent.

But what if the secret word has the N at position 2? We are not testing that with this word.

We are fixed on N at position 3 and E at position 4. But we don't know if that's correct. We are testing that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts N at position 2 and E at position 3? But we don't have a common word for that.

Another candidate: ""CNIDA"" (not common) or ""CNIDE"" (not common).

So let's go with ""CONES"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word might have the N at position 2? We don't know. But we can test that in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't fix the positions so much and tests more positions? But we have to start with C.

Another idea: ""CUBES"" -> C U B E S. This has E at position 4 and S at 5. But it doesn't have N? We must include N. So that's invalid.

We must include both N and E.

So let's choose between ""CONED"", ""CONES"", and ""CINES"".

I think ""CONES"" is a good choice because it uses S, which is common.

But let me see if we can get more information about the positions.

We know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4 and E is not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.

In ""CONES"", we are assuming that N is at position 3 and E at position 4. If that's not the case, we will get feedback that helps.

Similarly, for ""CONED"", we assume N at 3 and E at 4.

But we can also try to put N at position 2? We don't have a good word for that.

Another candidate: ""CNEME"" -> not a word.

""CNOLA"" -> has A? No, but has A? ""CNOLA"" is not common and has A? Actually, ""CNOLA"" is not standard. 

""CNUT"" is 4 letters.

So I think ""CONES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, what about ""CONE"" if we use it as a model? But it's 4 letters.

Alternatively, ""CONE"" is not 5.

Another word: ""CINED"" -> C I N E D -> this has I and D. Positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. This avoids R and A. And we test I and D.

But we don't know about I and D.

Similarly, ""CINES"" has I and S.

I think ""CINED"" is a valid word (meaning: acid).
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is absent (x).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- It contains 'N' and 'E', but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- 'R' and 'A' are absent and should be avoided.
- The word has 5 distinct letters (we don't know if duplicates exist, but no evidence so far).

For the second guess:
- Must start with 'C'.
- Must include 'N' and 'E' (since they are in the word), but 'N' cannot be in position 4 and 'E' cannot be in position 5.
- Must avoid 'R' and 'A'.
- Should test new common letters to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CONES"" (C O N E S) is a strong candidate:
  - Starts with 'C'.
  - Includes 'N' (position 3) and 'E' (position 4), which are new positions to test.
  - Avoids 'R' and 'A'.
  - Tests new common letters: 'O' and 'S'.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the positions of 'N' and 'E' and reveal if 'O' or 'S' are in the word.

<guess>cones</guess>",cones,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letter 'C' is in the word and is the first letter. So the secret word starts with 'C'.
- The letters 'R' and 'A' are not in the word at all.
- The letters 'N' and 'E' are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (so 'N' is not the fourth letter, and 'E' is not the fifth).

Since the word starts with 'C', we can write: C _ _ _ _

We also know that the word contains 'N' and 'E', but not in the positions we had in ""crane"". In ""crane"", 'N' was in the fourth position and 'E' in the fifth. So in the secret word:
- 'N' cannot be at position 4.
- 'E' cannot be at position 5.

Additionally, we must avoid using 'R' and 'A' because they are not in the word.

We need to make a second guess that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is fixed as 'C')
- Includes 'N' and 'E' (because they are in the word) but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does not include 'R' or 'A'.
- We can use other letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that start with 'C', have 'N' and 'E', and avoid 'R' and 'A'.

Possible positions for 'N' and 'E':
- 'N' can be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and not 1 because that's C).
- 'E' can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we know position 1 is C.

We also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: C, N, E, and two more letters.

We need to choose a word that uses 'N' and 'E' in different positions and includes two new letters.

Let's try to think of common words that start with C and have N and E.

Some possibilities:
- ""CINE"" is only 4 letters, so not 5.
- ""CONE"" has O and N, but we don't know about O. Also, in ""crane"", we had N at position 4, but in ""cone"", N is at position 3? Let's check: C O N E -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:?. But we know from feedback that in the secret word, N is not at position 4 (from our guess) but in ""cone"", N is at position 3, which is allowed. However, we also have E at position 4. But in our feedback, E was at position 5 in ""crane"" and was marked as present but wrong position. Now we are putting E at position 4. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. It could be at position 4.

But note: we must avoid using R and A. ""cone"" doesn't have R or A, so it's okay.

However, we have two new letters: O and the fifth letter. We don't know about O.

But let's see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts 'N' and 'E' in positions we haven't tried.

In our first guess, we had:
Position 1: C (correct)
Position 2: R (absent) -> so position 2 is not R, but we don't know what it is.
Position 3: A (absent) -> not A.
Position 4: N (present but wrong position) -> so in the secret word, position 4 is not N.
Position 5: E (present but wrong position) -> so position 5 is not E.

Now, for the second guess, we can try to put 'N' in a new position and 'E' in a new position.

For example, we can try to put 'N' at position 2 and 'E' at position 3? But we don't know if that's correct, but we can test.

Let me list some words that start with C, have N and E, and avoid R and A.

Possible words:
- ""CONE"": C O N E ? -> but we have to avoid the known absent letters. It has O and the fifth letter (which we don't know). Also, in ""cone"", N is at position 3 and E at position 4. This might be a candidate.

But note: we have to consider that the feedback for 'N' was that it is in the word but not at position 4. In ""cone"", N is at position 3, which is fine. Similarly, E is at position 4, which is not position 5, so that's allowed.

Another word: ""CINEW"" (meaning: a tendon) -> C I N E W. This has I, N, E, W. But we don't know about I and W. Also, positions: N is at 3, E at 4.

But we can also try to use a word that has 'N' and 'E' in positions we haven't tried, such as position 2 and 3, or 2 and 5, etc.

However, we must also consider that we have two more letters to discover.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has the 'N' and 'E' in different positions and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words that start with C, have N and E, and avoid R and A.

Some options:
- ""CONE"" (as above) -> C O N E ?
- ""CINED"" (but that's 5 letters? C I N E D -> but that's 5: C, I, N, E, D). But we don't know if D is in the word. Also, in this word, N is at position 3 and E at position 4? Wait: positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D.

But we have to avoid R and A, which we are.

Another option: ""CHINE"" (a type of worker) -> C H I N E. This has H and I. Positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:I, 4:N, 5:E. But wait, in this word, N is at position 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means in the secret word, N is not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 in our second guess? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. The feedback already told us that position 4 is not N. So we should avoid putting N at position 4.

Therefore, in ""CHINE"", N is at position 4, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid that.

Similarly, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

So for ""CHINE"", if we use it, we would be putting N at position 4 (which we know is wrong) and E at position 5 (also wrong). So that would be inefficient because we already know those positions are wrong.

Therefore, we should choose a word that has N in a position that is not 4, and E in a position that is not 5.

Let me try to find words that have N in position 2, 3, or 5 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

For example:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: we can put N? Yes, but then we have to avoid position 4 for N? Actually, we can put N at position 2, but then we have to see if it's correct. But we don't know. We can try.

But note: we also have to include E. Let's put E at position 3? Then we have C _ E _ _ and we need N somewhere (not position 4). So we can put N at position 2? Then we have C N E _ _. What letters for positions 4 and 5? We need two letters that are not R or A.

For example: ""CNEPT"" is not a word. ""CNED"" is not 5 letters. 

Alternatively, we can put N at position 5? Then we have C _ _ _ N, and E somewhere (not position 5, so positions 1,2,3,4). But position 5 is N, so E can be at 1,2,3,4.

Example: ""CUBEN"" (a type of deer) -> C U B E N. This has U and B. Positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:N. 
But note: E is at position 4 (which is not 5, so allowed) and N at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed). Also, we avoid R and A.

But is ""CUBEN"" a valid word? It might be obscure. Let me think of common words.

Another common word: ""CONEY"" -> but that has O and Y. And it ends with Y. But we don't know about O and Y. Also, in ""cone"", we have O and then N at 3 and E at 4. But we can use that.

But let's look for a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""CLINE"" (a term in geography) -> C L I N E. But then N is at position 4? Position 4 is N, which we know is wrong. So avoid.

""CNIDE"" (to scorn) -> C N I D E. This has N at position 2, which is new. And E at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5. Therefore, ""CNIDE"" is invalid for E position.

We must avoid putting E at position 5.

So let's try to put E at position 4? Then we have C _ _ E _ and N somewhere (not position 4). So if we put N at position 2, then we have C N ? E ? -> but then we need two more letters. What about ""CNITE""? Not a word.

Alternatively, put N at position 3 and E at position 4: then we have C _ N E _. What words? For example: ""CINE"" is 4 letters. ""CINCH"" has I and H, but also two N's? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback didn't indicate duplicate, but it's possible.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""CUBES"" -> C U B E S. This has U, B, E, S. Positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:S. 
But we are putting E at position 4 (which is allowed) and S at position 5. Also, we avoid R and A. This seems okay.

But we also have to consider that we need to test new letters. We haven't tested S, U, B, etc.

Another common word: ""CONED"" -> C O N E D. This has O and D. Positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. 
But wait, we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4. However, in our first guess, we had N at position 4 and it was wrong, but now we are putting N at position 3. That's a new position, so it's okay. Similarly, E at position 4 is new (we only know it's not at 5). 

But note: in ""CONED"", we have O and D. We don't know about O and D.

Also, we avoid R and A.

So ""CONED"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if it meets the criteria:
- Starts with C: yes.
- Has N and E: yes, at positions 3 and 4.
- Avoids R and A: yes.
- We are testing O and D.

Alternatively, we can try ""CONE"" (which is a common word) -> C O N E ?. But we have to fill the last letter. We can use a variety of letters. But note: we have to avoid R and A. Also, we know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to choose a word with 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, ""CONE"" has 4 letters? No, ""CONE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

""CONE"" is 4 letters. We need 5-letter words.

Let me think of 5-letter words starting with C, having N and E, and avoiding R and A.

Some options:
- ""CONED"" (as above) -> C O N E D
- ""CUBED"" -> C U B E D -> but then we don't have N? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include both N and E.

So we need a word that has both N and E.

Another: ""CINCH"" -> C I N C H -> but has two C's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. Also, we already know the first letter is C, so if we put C again, it might be redundant. But it's allowed. However, we are trying to get information, so maybe avoid duplicates for now.

""CLINE"" is invalid because N is at position 4.

""CNIDE"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

""CONED"" seems okay.

But let me see if there's a word that puts N at position 2 and E at position 3? For example: ""CNEZE"" is not a word.

""CNEMA"" is not 5 letters and has A which is absent.

Another: ""CONE"" is 4 letters. 

""CONES"" -> C O N E S -> but then E is at position 4 and S at position 5. This word has E at position 4 (allowed) and N at position 3 (allowed). Also, avoids R and A. And it's a common word.

So ""CONES"" is a candidate.

But note: in ""CONES"", we have O and S. We don't know about O and S.

Alternatively, ""CUBES"" has E at position 4 and S at position 5.

But let's compare:

Option 1: ""CONED"" -> C O N E D
Option 2: ""CONES"" -> C O N E S

Both are valid. Which one gives more information?

We know the secret word has an 'N' that is not at position 4, and an 'E' that is not at position 5. In ""CONED"", we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4. In ""CONES"", we are putting N at position 3 and E at position 4 as well.

But note: in ""CONED"", we are also testing O and D. In ""CONES"", we are testing O and S.

We might prefer S over D because S is a very common letter.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have S or D.

Another candidate: ""CINES"" (plural of cinch) -> C I N E S -> but then N is at position 3 and E at position 4? Positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:S. This avoids R and A. And we test I and S.

But we don't know if I is in the word.

Alternatively, ""CONE"" is 4 letters, so not valid.

Another 5-letter word: ""CAMEO"" -> but has A? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A.

So let's list:

- ""CONED"": C O N E D -> tests O and D, and puts N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CONES"": C O N E S -> tests O and S, and same positions.
- ""CINES"": C I N E S -> tests I and S, and N at 3, E at 4.

We can also consider putting N at position 5? For example, ""CUBEN"" (if accepted) or ""CUBES"" (but that has E at position 4 and S at 5). ""CUBES"" is a word: C U B E S -> E at 4, S at 5.

But we don't have N in this word? We must include N because we know it's in the word. So we have to include both N and E.

So we must have both N and E in the guess.

Therefore, we need a word that has both.

Another word: ""CNIDE"" is not a word.

""CNPLE"" not a word.

""CNUT"" is 4 letters.

So the main candidates are:

- ""CONED"": tests O, D, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CONES"": tests O, S, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.
- ""CINES"": tests I, S, and positions: N at 3, E at 4.

We can also consider ""CONE"" is 4, so no.

Another: ""CAMEL"" -> but has A? No, A is absent. So we cannot use A.

""CELLO"" -> but no N? We must include N.

So I think ""CONED"", ""CONES"", and ""CINES"" are candidates.

But note: we have two more letters to find, and we are testing two new letters in each.

We might also consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no indication so far.

Given that, I think ""CONES"" is a good choice because S is a very common letter.

But let me check: in ""CONES"", we are putting O at position 2, N at 3, E at 4, and S at 5. We also know that the secret word has an N that is not at 4 and an E that is not at 5. In ""CONES"", N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5), so that's consistent.

But what if the secret word has the N at position 2? We are not testing that with this word.

We are fixed on N at position 3 and E at position 4. But we don't know if that's correct. We are testing that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts N at position 2 and E at position 3? But we don't have a common word for that.

Another candidate: ""CNIDA"" (not common) or ""CNIDE"" (not common).

So let's go with ""CONES"".

But wait, we have to consider that the secret word might have the N at position 2? We don't know. But we can test that in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't fix the positions so much and tests more positions? But we have to start with C.

Another idea: ""CUBES"" -> C U B E S. This has E at position 4 and S at 5. But it doesn't have N? We must include N. So that's invalid.

We must include both N and E.

So let's choose between ""CONED"", ""CONES"", and ""CINES"".

I think ""CONES"" is a good choice because it uses S, which is common.

But let me see if we can get more information about the positions.

We know that in the secret word, N is not at position 4 and E is not at position 5. We don't know about other positions.

In ""CONES"", we are assuming that N is at position 3 and E at position 4. If that's not the case, we will get feedback that helps.

Similarly, for ""CONED"", we assume N at 3 and E at 4.

But we can also try to put N at position 2? We don't have a good word for that.

Another candidate: ""CNEME"" -> not a word.

""CNOLA"" -> has A? No, but has A? ""CNOLA"" is not common and has A? Actually, ""CNOLA"" is not standard. 

""CNUT"" is 4 letters.

So I think ""CONES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, what about ""CONE"" if we use it as a model? But it's 4 letters.

Alternatively, ""CONE"" is not 5.

Another word: ""CINED"" -> C I N E D -> this has I and D. Positions: 1:C, 2:I, 3:N, 4:E, 5:D. This avoids R and A. And we test I and D.

But we don't know about I and D.

Similarly, ""CINES"" has I and S.

I think ""CINED"" is a valid word (meaning: acid).Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is absent (x).
- A is absent (x).
- N is present but not in position 4 (-).
- E is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with 'C'.
- It contains 'N' and 'E', but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- 'R' and 'A' are absent and should be avoided.
- The word has 5 distinct letters (we don't know if duplicates exist, but no evidence so far).

For the second guess:
- Must start with 'C'.
- Must include 'N' and 'E' (since they are in the word), but 'N' cannot be in position 4 and 'E' cannot be in position 5.
- Must avoid 'R' and 'A'.
- Should test new common letters to gather more information.

After evaluating options:
- ""CONES"" (C O N E S) is a strong candidate:
  - Starts with 'C'.
  - Includes 'N' (position 3) and 'E' (position 4), which are new positions to test.
  - Avoids 'R' and 'A'.
  - Tests new common letters: 'O' and 'S'.
  - If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the positions of 'N' and 'E' and reveal if 'O' or 'S' are in the word.",Guess 2: cones -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
