We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
3. The letter A is not in the word at all.
4. The letter N is not in the word at all.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

Now, we can think about the positions:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Not R (and also not A, N) but we know R is somewhere else, and A and N are absent.
- Position 3: Unknown, but not A or N.
- Position 4: Unknown, but not A or N.
- Position 5: Not E (and also not A or N), but E is in the word.

We also know the word contains R and E (besides C).

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, they must be in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note:
- Position 1 is taken by C, so R and E cannot be there.
- Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5. Similarly, E can be in 2,3, or 4 (since not 5 and not 1).

But note: the feedback for R is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we know that A and N are absent.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use this guess to test possible positions for R and E, and also try to find other letters.

We know the word starts with C, and contains R and E (and we know A and N are out).

Let's think of words that start with C, have R and E, and do not have A or N.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again in the same positions that we already know are wrong? For example, we should not put R in position 2 again, and E in position 5 again.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in 3,4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: since it's not in position 5, it could be in 2,3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are just starting, we assume no duplicates for now.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me try to come up with a word that fits:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain A or N.
- And we want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

For example, we can try to put R in position 3 and E in position 4? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 4 and E in position 2? Let's see what words exist that start with C, have E in position 2, R in position 4, and what letter in position 5.

But we don't know the last letter.

We can also consider that we have two letters we know: R and E are in the word, but we don't know their positions.

A good strategy is to use a word that has R and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent, so we should avoid them. So available letters: all except A, N.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: O, I, U (since A is out and E is in, but E is already known).

But we also know the word has E.

We can try to use a word that has E in a new position and R in a new position, and also tests other common letters.

For example, let's try to put E in position 3 and R in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 2 and R in position 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be in 3,4, or 5.

So let's try to form a word:

Position 1: C (fixed)
Position 2: ? (we don't know, but it cannot be A or N, and we want to test new letters)
Position 3: ? (we want to test R? or E? or a new letter)
Position 4: ? (we want to test R? or E? or a new letter)
Position 5: ? (we know it cannot be E, and also cannot be A or N, so we have to choose from the remaining letters)

We also know that the word must contain R and E, so one of positions 3,4,5 must be R? But wait, we have two letters R and E to place, and three positions. However, we can try to put R in one of 3,4,5 and E in one of 2,3,4, but not conflicting.

But note: we cannot put E in position 5 because we know it's not there.

Let me try to think of words that start with C, have E, R, and without A and N.

Some possibilities:
- C? ? ? E -> but E cannot be in position 5? Actually, we can put E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

So for position 5, we cannot put E. So we must put a different letter.

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 2.

So let's try to put R in position 3 and E in position 4? Then position 5 must be a new letter.

Word: C, ?, R, E, ?

But what letters? We need a word that exists.

Alternatively, put E in position 2 and R in position 4: C, E, ?, R, ?

We can also try to put E in position 3 and R in position 5: C, ?, E, ?, R.

But note: we have to avoid A and N.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: C, E, ?, R, ? 
For example: ""CER??"" -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""CERES"" is not common. ""CERES"" might not be valid. 
""CEOR?"" -> ""CEORGE"" is 6 letters. 
""CEFR?"" -> not a word.

Actually, it's hard. Let me think of common words.

Option 2: C, ?, ?, R, E -> but that would put R in position 4 and E in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So that's invalid.

Option 3: C, E, ?, ?, R -> that would put E in position 2 and R in position 5. This is valid because E is not in 5 and R is not in 2.

Is there a word like C_E_R? For example, ""CER??"" again.

Alternatively, put E in position 3 and R in position 5: C, ?, E, ?, R.

What words? ""CUBER"" -> but that has U and B. ""CUBER"" is a word? It means a cube root. But let's check: C U B E R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:R -> but then E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This is acceptable.

But we don't know if U and B are in the word. We can try.

Another word: ""COWER"" -> C O W E R -> E in position 4, R in position 5. This is also acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid A and N. Both ""CUBER"" and ""COWER"" avoid A and N.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4 and R in position 3: C, ?, R, E, ?

Word: ""CR?E?"" -> but we cannot put R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in position 3? Then position 2 must be a new letter.

For example: ""C_R_E?"" -> ""CREPT"" -> C R E P T -> but wait, we have R in position 2? We know R is not in position 2 because the first guess had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.

Therefore, in ""CREPT"", R is in position 2 again -> that's invalid because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Back to ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:R -> R is in position 5, E in position 4. This is acceptable.

Similarly, ""COWER"": C O W E R -> E in position 4, R in position 5.

But we also want to test other letters. We have two unknown letters? Actually, we have three positions: 2, 3, and 4? But we are filling position 4 and 5 with E and R? Actually, we are filling position 4 with E and position 5 with R? In ""CUBER"", position 4 is E and position 5 is R? Wait, no: position 4 is E and position 5 is R? Actually, in ""CUBER"", the letters are: C (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So position 4 is E and position 5 is R.

But we know E is not in position 5? Actually, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess. But in this word, E is in position 4 and R in position 5. So that's okay.

But we also know that E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. Similarly, R is in position 5.

But we don't know if the word has U and B. So we can test them.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and R in position 4: C, ?, R, E, ?

For example: ""C?R E?"" -> ""CIRE?"" -> not a word. ""CHORE"" -> C H O R E -> but then E is in position 5? We cannot put E in position 5. So that's invalid.

Another: ""C?R?E"" -> ""CIRCE"" -> not common. ""CIRCE"" is not standard.

""CORED"" -> C O R E D -> but then R is in position 3 and E in position 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids A and N. Also, we test O and D.

But note: we have to make sure we don't put E in position 5. In ""CORED"", E is in position 4 and D in position 5.

Similarly, we can try ""CURED"" -> C U R E D -> same idea.

But we also want to test more letters. We have only tested C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we know A and N are absent, so we can use other letters.

We can also consider: since we know the first letter is C, and we know R and E are present, we can try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests other common letters like T, S, L, etc.

Another idea: we can try to put R in position 3 and E in position 2? But we don't have a word for that.

What about ""CERES""? Not common.

Alternatively, let's go with ""CORED"": C O R E D -> 
- Position 1: C (correct, we know)
- Position 2: O (new letter)
- Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
- Position 4: E (we are testing E in position 4)
- Position 5: D (new letter)

This way, we test R in position 3 and E in position 4, and also test O and D.

But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. Similarly for E.

Another option: ""CUBER"" or ""COWER"". But let's choose one that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CREST"": C R E S T -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2! Because we know R is not in position 2. So that's invalid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Another word: ""CRIER"" -> but that has two R's? And also E in position 4? But we have R in position 5? And we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? We don't have information about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""CABLE"" -> but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A and N.

So let's list possible words that start with C, have E and R (at least once), and without A and N.

Common words: 
- ""CURED"" -> C U R E D -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D -> this is valid.

- ""CORED"" -> C O R E D -> same.

- ""COWER"" -> C O W E R -> E in 4, R in 5.

- ""CUBER"" -> C U B E R -> E in 4, R in 5.

- ""CRIER"" -> has two R's? And E in position 4? But then R in position 5 and also in position 2? We cannot put R in position 2.

So ""CRIER"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

Another: ""CREPT"" -> invalid because R in position 2.

So we can use ""CURED"", ""CORED"", ""COWER"", ""CUBER"", etc.

But we also want to test more letters. We have only tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So we have 21 letters left.

We can try to use a word that has new letters to test.

For example, ""CURED"" uses U, R, E, D. We already know R and E are present, so we are testing U and D.

Similarly, ""CORED"" uses O, R, E, D.

But we also have the opportunity to test more vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O, I, U.

I think ""CURED"" is a good candidate: it tests U and D, and places R in position 3 and E in position 4.

But note: we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5, and R is not in position 2. In ""CURED"", R is in position 3 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

So let's go with ""CURED"".

But wait, what about the feedback for the first guess? We have:
- C: correct (position 1)
- R: present but not in position 2 -> in ""CURED"", R is in position 3, which is different.
- E: present but not in position 5 -> in ""CURED"", E is in position 4, which is different.

So ""CURED"" seems valid.

But we must ensure that we are not repeating the same mistake. Also, we are testing two new letters: U and D.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRIER"" but that has R in position 2 which is invalid.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" -> not common and has W and H? But we don't know.

I think ""CURED"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the word must be valid. ""CURED"" is a valid English word.

So I'll go with ""CURED"".

But note: we are not forced to put R and E in the same word? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R and E? But we know they are in the word, so that might not be efficient.

We must include R and E because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it's better to confirm their positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we should try to include the known letters in new positions.

So I think ""CURED"" is a good second guess.

But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we can avoid duplicates for now.

So let's guess ""CURED"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Also, we are testing U in position 2 and D in position 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another possibility: ""CRORE"" -> C R O R E -> but R is in position 2? Invalid.

""CREME"" -> C R E M E -> R in position 2? Invalid.

So ""CURED"" seems good.

But let me see: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

We can also consider ""COWER"" (C O W E R) to test O and W.

But I think ""CURED"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""CRIED"" -> C R I E D -> but R is in position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""CURED"".

But note: we have to avoid A and N. ""CURED"" has U, R, E, D. No A or N. Good.

So second guess: ""CURED""

But wait, what if the word has the R in position 4 and E in position 2? We haven't tested that. But we can only test one at a time.

We can also consider a word that has E in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have a common word for that.

For example, ""CEORL"" -> not common.

So I think ""CURED"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""CURED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- A and N are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The goal is to test new positions for R and E while introducing new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""CURED"" is chosen because:
- It starts with C (position 1).
- It places R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces two new common letters: U (position 2) and D (position 5).
- It avoids A and N.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for R and E while testing new letters.

<guess>cured</guess>",cured,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it's marked as wrong position).
3. The letter A is not in the word at all.
4. The letter N is not in the word at all.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters long.

Now, we can think about the positions:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: Not R (and also not A, N) but we know R is somewhere else, and A and N are absent.
- Position 3: Unknown, but not A or N.
- Position 4: Unknown, but not A or N.
- Position 5: Not E (and also not A or N), but E is in the word.

We also know the word contains R and E (besides C).

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, and E is in the word but not in position 5, they must be in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note:
- Position 1 is taken by C, so R and E cannot be there.
- Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we have 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is C, so R can be in 3,4, or 5. Similarly, E can be in 2,3, or 4 (since not 5 and not 1).

But note: the feedback for R is a minus, meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5.

Also, we know that A and N are absent.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We want to use this guess to test possible positions for R and E, and also try to find other letters.

We know the word starts with C, and contains R and E (and we know A and N are out).

Let's think of words that start with C, have R and E, and do not have A or N.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again in the same positions that we already know are wrong? For example, we should not put R in position 2 again, and E in position 5 again.

Possible positions for R: since it's not in position 2, it could be in 3,4, or 5.
Possible positions for E: since it's not in position 5, it could be in 2,3, or 4.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, since we are just starting, we assume no duplicates for now.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let me try to come up with a word that fits:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain A or N.
- And we want to test R in a new position and E in a new position.

For example, we can try to put R in position 3 and E in position 4? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 4 and E in position 2? Let's see what words exist that start with C, have E in position 2, R in position 4, and what letter in position 5.

But we don't know the last letter.

We can also consider that we have two letters we know: R and E are in the word, but we don't know their positions.

A good strategy is to use a word that has R and E in positions we haven't tested, and also includes other common letters that we haven't tried.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent, so we should avoid them. So available letters: all except A, N.

Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Common vowels left: O, I, U (since A is out and E is in, but E is already known).

But we also know the word has E.

We can try to use a word that has E in a new position and R in a new position, and also tests other common letters.

For example, let's try to put E in position 3 and R in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 2 and R in position 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in 2,3, or 4.

Similarly, R can be in 3,4, or 5.

So let's try to form a word:

Position 1: C (fixed)
Position 2: ? (we don't know, but it cannot be A or N, and we want to test new letters)
Position 3: ? (we want to test R? or E? or a new letter)
Position 4: ? (we want to test R? or E? or a new letter)
Position 5: ? (we know it cannot be E, and also cannot be A or N, so we have to choose from the remaining letters)

We also know that the word must contain R and E, so one of positions 3,4,5 must be R? But wait, we have two letters R and E to place, and three positions. However, we can try to put R in one of 3,4,5 and E in one of 2,3,4, but not conflicting.

But note: we cannot put E in position 5 because we know it's not there.

Let me try to think of words that start with C, have E, R, and without A and N.

Some possibilities:
- C? ? ? E -> but E cannot be in position 5? Actually, we can put E in position 5? But wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, it would be wrong again. So we should avoid that.

So for position 5, we cannot put E. So we must put a different letter.

Similarly, we cannot put R in position 2.

So let's try to put R in position 3 and E in position 4? Then position 5 must be a new letter.

Word: C, ?, R, E, ?

But what letters? We need a word that exists.

Alternatively, put E in position 2 and R in position 4: C, E, ?, R, ?

We can also try to put E in position 3 and R in position 5: C, ?, E, ?, R.

But note: we have to avoid A and N.

Let me list some words:

Option 1: C, E, ?, R, ? 
For example: ""CER??"" -> but we need a 5-letter word. ""CERES"" is not common. ""CERES"" might not be valid. 
""CEOR?"" -> ""CEORGE"" is 6 letters. 
""CEFR?"" -> not a word.

Actually, it's hard. Let me think of common words.

Option 2: C, ?, ?, R, E -> but that would put R in position 4 and E in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5. So that's invalid.

Option 3: C, E, ?, ?, R -> that would put E in position 2 and R in position 5. This is valid because E is not in 5 and R is not in 2.

Is there a word like C_E_R? For example, ""CER??"" again.

Alternatively, put E in position 3 and R in position 5: C, ?, E, ?, R.

What words? ""CUBER"" -> but that has U and B. ""CUBER"" is a word? It means a cube root. But let's check: C U B E R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:R -> but then E is in position 4 and R in position 5. This is acceptable.

But we don't know if U and B are in the word. We can try.

Another word: ""COWER"" -> C O W E R -> E in position 4, R in position 5. This is also acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid A and N. Both ""CUBER"" and ""COWER"" avoid A and N.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4 and R in position 3: C, ?, R, E, ?

Word: ""CR?E?"" -> but we cannot put R in position 2? Actually, we can put R in position 3? Then position 2 must be a new letter.

For example: ""C_R_E?"" -> ""CREPT"" -> C R E P T -> but wait, we have R in position 2? We know R is not in position 2 because the first guess had R in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position. So we cannot put R in position 2 again.

Therefore, in ""CREPT"", R is in position 2 again -> that's invalid because we know R is not in position 2.

So we must avoid putting R in position 2 and E in position 5.

Back to ""CUBER"": C U B E R -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:B, 4:E, 5:R -> R is in position 5, E in position 4. This is acceptable.

Similarly, ""COWER"": C O W E R -> E in position 4, R in position 5.

But we also want to test other letters. We have two unknown letters? Actually, we have three positions: 2, 3, and 4? But we are filling position 4 and 5 with E and R? Actually, we are filling position 4 with E and position 5 with R? In ""CUBER"", position 4 is E and position 5 is R? Wait, no: position 4 is E and position 5 is R? Actually, in ""CUBER"", the letters are: C (1), U (2), B (3), E (4), R (5). So position 4 is E and position 5 is R.

But we know E is not in position 5? Actually, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess. But in this word, E is in position 4 and R in position 5. So that's okay.

But we also know that E is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. Similarly, R is in position 5.

But we don't know if the word has U and B. So we can test them.

Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 3 and R in position 4: C, ?, R, E, ?

For example: ""C?R E?"" -> ""CIRE?"" -> not a word. ""CHORE"" -> C H O R E -> but then E is in position 5? We cannot put E in position 5. So that's invalid.

Another: ""C?R?E"" -> ""CIRCE"" -> not common. ""CIRCE"" is not standard.

""CORED"" -> C O R E D -> but then R is in position 3 and E in position 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids A and N. Also, we test O and D.

But note: we have to make sure we don't put E in position 5. In ""CORED"", E is in position 4 and D in position 5.

Similarly, we can try ""CURED"" -> C U R E D -> same idea.

But we also want to test more letters. We have only tested C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we know A and N are absent, so we can use other letters.

We can also consider: since we know the first letter is C, and we know R and E are present, we can try to use a word that has R and E in new positions and also tests other common letters like T, S, L, etc.

Another idea: we can try to put R in position 3 and E in position 2? But we don't have a word for that.

What about ""CERES""? Not common.

Alternatively, let's go with ""CORED"": C O R E D -> 
- Position 1: C (correct, we know)
- Position 2: O (new letter)
- Position 3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
- Position 4: E (we are testing E in position 4)
- Position 5: D (new letter)

This way, we test R in position 3 and E in position 4, and also test O and D.

But note: we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 3. Similarly for E.

Another option: ""CUBER"" or ""COWER"". But let's choose one that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try ""CREST"": C R E S T -> but wait, we cannot put R in position 2! Because we know R is not in position 2. So that's invalid.

So we must avoid position 2 for R.

Another word: ""CRIER"" -> but that has two R's? And also E in position 4? But we have R in position 5? And we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? We don't have information about duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""CABLE"" -> but we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

We must avoid A and N.

So let's list possible words that start with C, have E and R (at least once), and without A and N.

Common words: 
- ""CURED"" -> C U R E D -> positions: 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:E, 5:D -> this is valid.

- ""CORED"" -> C O R E D -> same.

- ""COWER"" -> C O W E R -> E in 4, R in 5.

- ""CUBER"" -> C U B E R -> E in 4, R in 5.

- ""CRIER"" -> has two R's? And E in position 4? But then R in position 5 and also in position 2? We cannot put R in position 2.

So ""CRIER"" is invalid because of R in position 2.

Another: ""CREPT"" -> invalid because R in position 2.

So we can use ""CURED"", ""CORED"", ""COWER"", ""CUBER"", etc.

But we also want to test more letters. We have only tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are absent. So we have 21 letters left.

We can try to use a word that has new letters to test.

For example, ""CURED"" uses U, R, E, D. We already know R and E are present, so we are testing U and D.

Similarly, ""CORED"" uses O, R, E, D.

But we also have the opportunity to test more vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O, I, U.

I think ""CURED"" is a good candidate: it tests U and D, and places R in position 3 and E in position 4.

But note: we know from the first guess that E is not in position 5, and R is not in position 2. In ""CURED"", R is in position 3 and E in position 4, which are new positions.

So let's go with ""CURED"".

But wait, what about the feedback for the first guess? We have:
- C: correct (position 1)
- R: present but not in position 2 -> in ""CURED"", R is in position 3, which is different.
- E: present but not in position 5 -> in ""CURED"", E is in position 4, which is different.

So ""CURED"" seems valid.

But we must ensure that we are not repeating the same mistake. Also, we are testing two new letters: U and D.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRIER"" but that has R in position 2 which is invalid.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" -> not common and has W and H? But we don't know.

I think ""CURED"" is a good choice.

But let me check: the word must be valid. ""CURED"" is a valid English word.

So I'll go with ""CURED"".

But note: we are not forced to put R and E in the same word? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word, and we want to find their positions.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have R and E? But we know they are in the word, so that might not be efficient.

We must include R and E because we know they are in the word? Actually, we don't have to, but it's better to confirm their positions.

But we have limited guesses, so we should try to include the known letters in new positions.

So I think ""CURED"" is a good second guess.

But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But we can avoid duplicates for now.

So let's guess ""CURED"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3 and E in position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

Also, we are testing U in position 2 and D in position 5.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Another possibility: ""CRORE"" -> C R O R E -> but R is in position 2? Invalid.

""CREME"" -> C R E M E -> R in position 2? Invalid.

So ""CURED"" seems good.

But let me see: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

We can also consider ""COWER"" (C O W E R) to test O and W.

But I think ""CURED"" is fine.

Alternatively, ""CRIED"" -> C R I E D -> but R is in position 2? Invalid.

So I'll go with ""CURED"".

But note: we have to avoid A and N. ""CURED"" has U, R, E, D. No A or N. Good.

So second guess: ""CURED""

But wait, what if the word has the R in position 4 and E in position 2? We haven't tested that. But we can only test one at a time.

We can also consider a word that has E in position 2 and R in position 3? But we don't have a common word for that.

For example, ""CEORL"" -> not common.

So I think ""CURED"" is a reasonable choice.

Therefore, I will guess ""CURED"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key insights:
- The secret word starts with C.
- R is present but not in position 2, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- E is present but not in position 5, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- A and N are absent, so they can be excluded from future guesses.
- The goal is to test new positions for R and E while introducing new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess, ""CURED"" is chosen because:
- It starts with C (position 1).
- It places R in position 3 (a new position to test).
- It places E in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces two new common letters: U (position 2) and D (position 5).
- It avoids A and N.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for R and E while testing new letters.",Guess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
