We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.

<guess>tares</guess>",tares,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.",Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.

Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.\n\n However, we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don\'t know if L and T are in the word? And we haven\'t tested L and T.\n\n But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn\'t have C or N.\n\n However, let\'s check the positions in ""LATER"":\n   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.\n\n But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.\n\n However, we must consider the feedback: \n   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.\n   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so allowed.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""LATER"". But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? \n\n For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we must avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARE""? \n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) \n\n Let me think of common words.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.\n   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). \n   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ARISE""? \n   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n In ""ARISE"": \n   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don\'t know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).\n   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""RAZED""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.\n   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).\n\n But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.\n\n However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.\n\n Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: \n   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). \n   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). \n\n But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   E at 1: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? (it wasn\'t at 5, so 1 is allowed)\n   A at 2: we don\'t know if A can be at 2? (it wasn\'t at 3, so 2 is allowed)\n   R at 3: we don\'t know if R can be at 3? (it wasn\'t at 2, so 3 is allowed)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don\'t have any information about position 1 for E? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we are also testing L and Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   A cannot be at position 3.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.\n\n Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.\n   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)\n   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.\n\n However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.\n\n But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.\n\n But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.\n   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.\n   R at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.\n\n Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.\n\n Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   A at 1 (not 3, okay)\n   E at 3 (not 5, okay)\n   R at 4 (not 2, okay)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n However, we are also testing L and T.\n\n Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   A at 1 (okay)\n   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)\n   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.\n\n Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That\'s a new position, so it\'s okay.\n\n Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).\n\n And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ALTER"".\n\n However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.\n\n But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n We must include E.\n\n So let\'s stick with ""ALTER"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.\n\n However, ""EARLY"": \n   E at 1 (not 5, okay)\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at 3 (not 2, okay)\n   L at 4, Y at 5.\n\n This also tests L and Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if Y is common? \n\n Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.\n   A at 2 (okay)\n   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)\n   E at 4 (okay, not 5)\n   But T at 1, S at 5.\n\n This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".\n\n Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.\n\n But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet, to get more information.\n\n We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.\n\n But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.\n\n In ""ALTER"": L and T.\n\n Both are good.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""TARES""\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TARES"".\n\n However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That\'s a new position.\n\n Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""TARES"" seems good.\n\n But let me check: \n   T at 1: we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know about position 2.\n   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.\n   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.\n   S at 5: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess: ""TARES""\n\n<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-"").

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   So the word is: _ A R E _
   We know the first and last letters are missing.

2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x's).

3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters.

The first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Similarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

We know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?

We need to fill in the first and fifth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

From the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.

Now, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we don't have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates? But we don't have any indication. So we'll assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.

Similarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.

We need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _

Common words that fit:

- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don't have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? But we haven't been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don't know.

But let's look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the second guess? But we didn't have another R in the second guess. So we don't know.

But we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

But let's check the word ""LATER"": 
  L at 1: we don't know if L is in the word? 
  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.

""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.

Another word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R's? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.

But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

But note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let's think of more common words.

Another word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R's and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: _ A R E _

So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?

Common words:
- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.
- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: 
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: ?

The word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.

We know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E's? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E's, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's list possible words:

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R's? And we don't know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it's valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).

But we can also think of other words without duplicates.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R's.

- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.

- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R's.

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.

But we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven't tested them.

But note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.

So ""HAREM"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words without duplicates.

What about ""WARER""? Not a common word.

""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.

We need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.

- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.

- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It's the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let's see.

- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.

- ""LARED"": not common.

- ""WARED"": not common.

- ""HAREM"" is the most common.

But we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that's B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

Similarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.

""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it's not as common.

""HAREM"" is more common.

But we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.

So the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

But we must check if they meet the criteria.

""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.

""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.

But we need to see if they are valid words.

We can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.

Another word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.

""BARER"" -> duplicate R.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""HAREM"" (common)
- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)

But we have to choose one.

We also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.

""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".

But we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It's a verb.

But ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.

But we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.

We can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.

So the candidates are:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5
- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5

We need to test one of these.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.

But note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on H and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one.

We can also consider if there are more words.

What about ""WARED""? Not common.

""YARED""? Not common.

""ZARED""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".

""HAREM"" is a common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.

We can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don't know.

But ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).

But we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.

But it has two R's.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's.

So if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

So the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?

So the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is not as common.

We can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.

""HAREM"" is the best.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.

So let's go with ""HAREM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.

We have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

But we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.

We can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven't tried? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.

But let's see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""HAREM"".

But note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.

So the guess is ""HAREM"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct (we know)
  R at 3: correct (we know)
  E at 4: correct (we know)
  M at 5: we don't know.

If the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WARED"" but it's obscure.

I think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - C and N are absent (x).
  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: 
    - R cannot be in position 2.
    - A cannot be in position 3.
    - E cannot be in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
  - T and S are absent (x).
  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:
    - A is in position 2 (correct).
    - R is in position 3 (correct).
    - E is in position 4 (correct).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- The first and fifth letters are unknown.
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.
- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.
- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:
  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)
  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)
  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)
- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.

### Why ""HAREM""?
- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).

<guess>harem</guess>",harem,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   So the word is: _ A R E _
   We know the first and last letters are missing.

2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x's).

3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters.

The first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Similarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

We know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?

We need to fill in the first and fifth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

From the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.

Now, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we don't have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates? But we don't have any indication. So we'll assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.

Similarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.

We need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _

Common words that fit:

- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don't have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? But we haven't been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don't know.

But let's look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the second guess? But we didn't have another R in the second guess. So we don't know.

But we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

But let's check the word ""LATER"": 
  L at 1: we don't know if L is in the word? 
  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.

""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.

Another word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R's? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.

But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

But note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let's think of more common words.

Another word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R's and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: _ A R E _

So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?

Common words:
- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.
- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: 
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: ?

The word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.

We know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E's? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E's, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's list possible words:

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R's? And we don't know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it's valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).

But we can also think of other words without duplicates.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R's.

- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.

- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R's.

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.

But we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven't tested them.

But note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.

So ""HAREM"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words without duplicates.

What about ""WARER""? Not a common word.

""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.

We need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.

- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.

- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It's the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let's see.

- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.

- ""LARED"": not common.

- ""WARED"": not common.

- ""HAREM"" is the most common.

But we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that's B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

Similarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.

""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it's not as common.

""HAREM"" is more common.

But we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.

So the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

But we must check if they meet the criteria.

""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.

""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.

But we need to see if they are valid words.

We can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.

Another word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.

""BARER"" -> duplicate R.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""HAREM"" (common)
- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)

But we have to choose one.

We also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.

""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".

But we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It's a verb.

But ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.

But we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.

We can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.

So the candidates are:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5
- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5

We need to test one of these.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.

But note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on H and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one.

We can also consider if there are more words.

What about ""WARED""? Not common.

""YARED""? Not common.

""ZARED""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".

""HAREM"" is a common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.

We can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don't know.

But ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).

But we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.

But it has two R's.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's.

So if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

So the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?

So the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is not as common.

We can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.

""HAREM"" is the best.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.

So let's go with ""HAREM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.

We have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

But we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.

We can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven't tried? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.

But let's see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""HAREM"".

But note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.

So the guess is ""HAREM"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct (we know)
  R at 3: correct (we know)
  E at 4: correct (we know)
  M at 5: we don't know.

If the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WARED"" but it's obscure.

I think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - C and N are absent (x).
  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: 
    - R cannot be in position 2.
    - A cannot be in position 3.
    - E cannot be in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
  - T and S are absent (x).
  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:
    - A is in position 2 (correct).
    - R is in position 3 (correct).
    - E is in position 4 (correct).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- The first and fifth letters are unknown.
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.
- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.
- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:
  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)
  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)
  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)
- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.

### Why ""HAREM""?
- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).",Guess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.

<guess>tares</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   So the word is: _ A R E _
   We know the first and last letters are missing.

2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x's).

3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters.

The first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Similarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

We know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?

We need to fill in the first and fifth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

From the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.

Now, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we don't have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates? But we don't have any indication. So we'll assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.

Similarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.

We need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _

Common words that fit:

- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don't have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? But we haven't been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don't know.

But let's look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the second guess? But we didn't have another R in the second guess. So we don't know.

But we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

But let's check the word ""LATER"": 
  L at 1: we don't know if L is in the word? 
  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.

""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.

Another word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R's? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.

But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

But note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let's think of more common words.

Another word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R's and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: _ A R E _

So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?

Common words:
- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.
- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: 
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: ?

The word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.

We know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E's? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E's, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's list possible words:

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R's? And we don't know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it's valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).

But we can also think of other words without duplicates.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R's.

- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.

- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R's.

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.

But we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven't tested them.

But note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.

So ""HAREM"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words without duplicates.

What about ""WARER""? Not a common word.

""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.

We need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.

- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.

- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It's the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let's see.

- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.

- ""LARED"": not common.

- ""WARED"": not common.

- ""HAREM"" is the most common.

But we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that's B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

Similarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.

""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it's not as common.

""HAREM"" is more common.

But we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.

So the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

But we must check if they meet the criteria.

""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.

""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.

But we need to see if they are valid words.

We can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.

Another word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.

""BARER"" -> duplicate R.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""HAREM"" (common)
- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)

But we have to choose one.

We also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.

""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".

But we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It's a verb.

But ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.

But we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.

We can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.

So the candidates are:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5
- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5

We need to test one of these.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.

But note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on H and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one.

We can also consider if there are more words.

What about ""WARED""? Not common.

""YARED""? Not common.

""ZARED""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".

""HAREM"" is a common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.

We can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don't know.

But ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).

But we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.

But it has two R's.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's.

So if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

So the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?

So the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is not as common.

We can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.

""HAREM"" is the best.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.

So let's go with ""HAREM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.

We have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

But we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.

We can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven't tried? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.

But let's see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""HAREM"".

But note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.

So the guess is ""HAREM"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct (we know)
  R at 3: correct (we know)
  E at 4: correct (we know)
  M at 5: we don't know.

If the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WARED"" but it's obscure.

I think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - C and N are absent (x).
  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: 
    - R cannot be in position 2.
    - A cannot be in position 3.
    - E cannot be in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
  - T and S are absent (x).
  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:
    - A is in position 2 (correct).
    - R is in position 3 (correct).
    - E is in position 4 (correct).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- The first and fifth letters are unknown.
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.
- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.
- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:
  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)
  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)
  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)
- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.

### Why ""HAREM""?
- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).

Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.\n\n However, we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don\'t know if L and T are in the word? And we haven\'t tested L and T.\n\n But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn\'t have C or N.\n\n However, let\'s check the positions in ""LATER"":\n   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.\n\n But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.\n\n However, we must consider the feedback: \n   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.\n   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so allowed.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""LATER"". But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? \n\n For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we must avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARE""? \n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) \n\n Let me think of common words.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.\n   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). \n   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ARISE""? \n   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n In ""ARISE"": \n   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don\'t know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).\n   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""RAZED""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.\n   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).\n\n But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.\n\n However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.\n\n Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: \n   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). \n   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). \n\n But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   E at 1: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? (it wasn\'t at 5, so 1 is allowed)\n   A at 2: we don\'t know if A can be at 2? (it wasn\'t at 3, so 2 is allowed)\n   R at 3: we don\'t know if R can be at 3? (it wasn\'t at 2, so 3 is allowed)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don\'t have any information about position 1 for E? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we are also testing L and Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   A cannot be at position 3.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.\n\n Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.\n   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)\n   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.\n\n However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.\n\n But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.\n\n But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.\n   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.\n   R at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.\n\n Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.\n\n Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   A at 1 (not 3, okay)\n   E at 3 (not 5, okay)\n   R at 4 (not 2, okay)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n However, we are also testing L and T.\n\n Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   A at 1 (okay)\n   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)\n   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.\n\n Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That\'s a new position, so it\'s okay.\n\n Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).\n\n And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ALTER"".\n\n However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.\n\n But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n We must include E.\n\n So let\'s stick with ""ALTER"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.\n\n However, ""EARLY"": \n   E at 1 (not 5, okay)\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at 3 (not 2, okay)\n   L at 4, Y at 5.\n\n This also tests L and Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if Y is common? \n\n Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.\n   A at 2 (okay)\n   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)\n   E at 4 (okay, not 5)\n   But T at 1, S at 5.\n\n This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".\n\n Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.\n\n But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet, to get more information.\n\n We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.\n\n But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.\n\n In ""ALTER"": L and T.\n\n Both are good.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""TARES""\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TARES"".\n\n However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That\'s a new position.\n\n Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""TARES"" seems good.\n\n But let me check: \n   T at 1: we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know about position 2.\n   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.\n   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.\n   S at 5: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess: ""TARES""\n\n<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - A cannot be in position 3.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.\n2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.\n3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.\n4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:\n   - R now in position 3 (not 2).\n   - A now in position 2 (not 3).\n   - E now in position 4 (not 5).\n\nThe word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n   So the word is: _ A R E _\n   We know the first and last letters are missing.\n\n2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x\'s).\n\n3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fifth letters.\n\nThe first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nWe know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?\n\nWe need to fill in the first and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\nFrom the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.\n\nNow, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we don\'t have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it\'s possible to have duplicates? But we don\'t have any indication. So we\'ll assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\nSo the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.\n\nWe need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nCommon words that fit:\n\n- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don\'t have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? But we haven\'t been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two R\'s, then in the first guess we would have seen two R\'s? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it\'s correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a \'-\' for the R in the second guess? But we didn\'t have another R in the second guess. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut let\'s check the word ""LATER"": \n  L at 1: we don\'t know if L is in the word? \n  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.\n\n""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.\n\nAnother word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R\'s? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.\n\nBut we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let\'s think of more common words.\n\nAnother word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R\'s and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nSo the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?\n\nCommon words:\n- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.\n- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: ?\n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: R (fixed)\n  Position 4: E (fixed)\n  Position 5: ?\n\nThe word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.\n\nWe know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E\'s? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E\'s, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it\'s valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).\n\nBut we can also think of other words without duplicates.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R\'s.\n\n- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.\n\n- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R\'s.\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.\n\nBut we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.\n\nSo ""HAREM"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""WARER""? Not a common word.\n\n""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.\n\nWe need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).\n\nExcluded letters: C, N, T, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.\n\n- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.\n\n- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It\'s the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let\'s see.\n\n- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.\n\n- ""LARED"": not common.\n\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n\n- ""HAREM"" is the most common.\n\nBut we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that\'s B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it\'s not as common.\n\n""HAREM"" is more common.\n\nBut we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.\n\nSo the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nBut we must check if they meet the criteria.\n\n""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.\n\n""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.\n\nBut we need to see if they are valid words.\n\nWe can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.\n\nAnother word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.\n\n""BARER"" -> duplicate R.\n\nSo without duplicates, we have:\n\n- ""HAREM"" (common)\n- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let\'s see.\n\n""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It\'s a verb.\n\nBut ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.\n\nBut we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.\n\nSo the candidates are:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5\n- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5\n\nWe need to test one of these.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider if there are more words.\n\nWhat about ""WARED""? Not common.\n\n""YARED""? Not common.\n\n""ZARED""? Not common.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".\n\n""HAREM"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.\n\nWe can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.\n\nAnother word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven\'t excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).\n\nBut we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.\n\nBut it has two R\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARER"" has two R\'s.\n\nSo if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is not as common.\n\nWe can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.\n\n""HAREM"" is the best.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.\n\nWe can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven\'t tried? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.\n\nSo the guess is ""HAREM"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n  H at 1: we don\'t know.\n  A at 2: correct (we know)\n  R at 3: correct (we know)\n  E at 4: correct (we know)\n  M at 5: we don\'t know.\n\nIf the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nBut we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WARED"" but it\'s obscure.\n\nI think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: \n  - C and N are absent (x).\n  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: \n    - R cannot be in position 2.\n    - A cannot be in position 3.\n    - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:\n  - T and S are absent (x).\n  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:\n    - A is in position 2 (correct).\n    - R is in position 3 (correct).\n    - E is in position 4 (correct).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).\n- The first and fifth letters are unknown.\n- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.\n- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.\n- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.\n- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:\n  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)\n  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)\n  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)\n- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.\n\n### Why ""HAREM""?\n- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).\n\n<guess>harem</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ 
   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.
   - So the word is: ? A R E ?

2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.

3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.
- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D's? Actually, it's D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).
- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.
- ""GARED"": not a common word.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not a word.
- ""LARED"": not standard.
- ""PARED"": as above.
- ""WARED"": not common.

So the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R's and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.

Another word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.

But let's see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:
  P at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct.
  R at 3: correct.
  E at 4: correct.
  R at 5: if the word has two R's, then it might be correct? But we don't know.

However, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R's, then it might be okay.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.

But we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. 

We can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn't have E at position 4? It's B A R O N, which doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have E at position 4.

So the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates.

We need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.

Similarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.

But we don't know if D is in the word. We have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.

We can try ""PARED"" for P and D.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don't have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.

Other words? 

- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.
- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R's? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.

But ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.

But note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it's duplicated).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word is ""PARER"", then:
  P: ? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R's.

But we don't know if the last letter is R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".

I think it's safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.

We have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. 

We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.

So let's guess ""BARED"".

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.

Another idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So we cannot change that.

We must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.

So the only flexibility is the first and last letters.

We can try ""BARED"".

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.

We can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".

I think we should try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the word is ""PARER""? Then we haven't considered duplicates.

But let's see: if we try ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have two more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at the end to test? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"".

So I'll go with ""BARED"".

But let me confirm: ""BARED"" is a common word.

So the guess is ""BARED"".

But note: we are putting B at 1 and D at 5.

If the word is ""BARED"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But we have other options: ""PARED"", ""FARED"" (if accepted), etc.

But ""FARED"" is not common.

Another word: ""GARED"" is not common.

So the main options are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WAVED"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""JARED"" is not common.

So I think ""BARED"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BARED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M (excluded from the word).
- **Known present letters**: A, R, E (with positions locked).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list (available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E ?`.
- Common candidates include:
  - **BARED**: B at 1, D at 5
  - **PARED**: P at 1, D at 5
  - **FARED**: F at 1, D at 5 (less common)
- ""BARED"" tests **B** and **D**, which are high-frequency letters. ""PARED"" tests **P** and **D**. 

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **BARED** to test **B** and **D** efficiently. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if B or D is present and in the right position, narrowing to ""PARED"" or other candidates.

### Why ""BARED""?
- Tests **B** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both new and common letters.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback will reveal:
  - If **B** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
  - If **D** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
- This will pinpoint the solution to ""PARED"" or another candidate (e.g., ""FARED"" if valid).

<guess>bared</guess>",bared,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ 
   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.
   - So the word is: ? A R E ?

2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.

3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.
- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D's? Actually, it's D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).
- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.
- ""GARED"": not a common word.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not a word.
- ""LARED"": not standard.
- ""PARED"": as above.
- ""WARED"": not common.

So the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R's and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.

Another word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.

But let's see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:
  P at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct.
  R at 3: correct.
  E at 4: correct.
  R at 5: if the word has two R's, then it might be correct? But we don't know.

However, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R's, then it might be okay.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.

But we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. 

We can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn't have E at position 4? It's B A R O N, which doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have E at position 4.

So the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates.

We need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.

Similarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.

But we don't know if D is in the word. We have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.

We can try ""PARED"" for P and D.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don't have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.

Other words? 

- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.
- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R's? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.

But ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.

But note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it's duplicated).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word is ""PARER"", then:
  P: ? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R's.

But we don't know if the last letter is R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".

I think it's safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.

We have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. 

We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.

So let's guess ""BARED"".

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.

Another idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So we cannot change that.

We must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.

So the only flexibility is the first and last letters.

We can try ""BARED"".

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.

We can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".

I think we should try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the word is ""PARER""? Then we haven't considered duplicates.

But let's see: if we try ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have two more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at the end to test? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"".

So I'll go with ""BARED"".

But let me confirm: ""BARED"" is a common word.

So the guess is ""BARED"".

But note: we are putting B at 1 and D at 5.

If the word is ""BARED"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But we have other options: ""PARED"", ""FARED"" (if accepted), etc.

But ""FARED"" is not common.

Another word: ""GARED"" is not common.

So the main options are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WAVED"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""JARED"" is not common.

So I think ""BARED"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BARED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M (excluded from the word).
- **Known present letters**: A, R, E (with positions locked).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list (available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E ?`.
- Common candidates include:
  - **BARED**: B at 1, D at 5
  - **PARED**: P at 1, D at 5
  - **FARED**: F at 1, D at 5 (less common)
- ""BARED"" tests **B** and **D**, which are high-frequency letters. ""PARED"" tests **P** and **D**. 

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **BARED** to test **B** and **D** efficiently. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if B or D is present and in the right position, narrowing to ""PARED"" or other candidates.

### Why ""BARED""?
- Tests **B** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both new and common letters.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback will reveal:
  - If **B** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
  - If **D** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
- This will pinpoint the solution to ""PARED"" or another candidate (e.g., ""FARED"" if valid).",Guess 4: bared -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.

<guess>tares</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   So the word is: _ A R E _
   We know the first and last letters are missing.

2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x's).

3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters.

The first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Similarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

We know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?

We need to fill in the first and fifth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

From the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.

Now, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we don't have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates? But we don't have any indication. So we'll assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.

Similarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.

We need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _

Common words that fit:

- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don't have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? But we haven't been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don't know.

But let's look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the second guess? But we didn't have another R in the second guess. So we don't know.

But we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

But let's check the word ""LATER"": 
  L at 1: we don't know if L is in the word? 
  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.

""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.

Another word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R's? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.

But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

But note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let's think of more common words.

Another word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R's and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: _ A R E _

So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?

Common words:
- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.
- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: 
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: ?

The word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.

We know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E's? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E's, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's list possible words:

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R's? And we don't know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it's valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).

But we can also think of other words without duplicates.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R's.

- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.

- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R's.

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.

But we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven't tested them.

But note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.

So ""HAREM"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words without duplicates.

What about ""WARER""? Not a common word.

""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.

We need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.

- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.

- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It's the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let's see.

- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.

- ""LARED"": not common.

- ""WARED"": not common.

- ""HAREM"" is the most common.

But we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that's B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

Similarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.

""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it's not as common.

""HAREM"" is more common.

But we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.

So the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

But we must check if they meet the criteria.

""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.

""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.

But we need to see if they are valid words.

We can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.

Another word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.

""BARER"" -> duplicate R.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""HAREM"" (common)
- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)

But we have to choose one.

We also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.

""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".

But we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It's a verb.

But ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.

But we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.

We can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.

So the candidates are:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5
- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5

We need to test one of these.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.

But note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on H and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one.

We can also consider if there are more words.

What about ""WARED""? Not common.

""YARED""? Not common.

""ZARED""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".

""HAREM"" is a common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.

We can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don't know.

But ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).

But we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.

But it has two R's.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's.

So if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

So the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?

So the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is not as common.

We can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.

""HAREM"" is the best.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.

So let's go with ""HAREM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.

We have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

But we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.

We can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven't tried? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.

But let's see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""HAREM"".

But note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.

So the guess is ""HAREM"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct (we know)
  R at 3: correct (we know)
  E at 4: correct (we know)
  M at 5: we don't know.

If the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WARED"" but it's obscure.

I think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - C and N are absent (x).
  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: 
    - R cannot be in position 2.
    - A cannot be in position 3.
    - E cannot be in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
  - T and S are absent (x).
  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:
    - A is in position 2 (correct).
    - R is in position 3 (correct).
    - E is in position 4 (correct).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- The first and fifth letters are unknown.
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.
- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.
- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:
  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)
  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)
  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)
- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.

### Why ""HAREM""?
- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).

<guess>harem</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ 
   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.
   - So the word is: ? A R E ?

2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.

3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.
- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D's? Actually, it's D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).
- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.
- ""GARED"": not a common word.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not a word.
- ""LARED"": not standard.
- ""PARED"": as above.
- ""WARED"": not common.

So the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R's and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.

Another word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.

But let's see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:
  P at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct.
  R at 3: correct.
  E at 4: correct.
  R at 5: if the word has two R's, then it might be correct? But we don't know.

However, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R's, then it might be okay.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.

But we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. 

We can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn't have E at position 4? It's B A R O N, which doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have E at position 4.

So the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates.

We need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.

Similarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.

But we don't know if D is in the word. We have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.

We can try ""PARED"" for P and D.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don't have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.

Other words? 

- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.
- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R's? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.

But ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.

But note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it's duplicated).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word is ""PARER"", then:
  P: ? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R's.

But we don't know if the last letter is R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".

I think it's safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.

We have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. 

We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.

So let's guess ""BARED"".

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.

Another idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So we cannot change that.

We must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.

So the only flexibility is the first and last letters.

We can try ""BARED"".

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.

We can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".

I think we should try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the word is ""PARER""? Then we haven't considered duplicates.

But let's see: if we try ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have two more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at the end to test? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"".

So I'll go with ""BARED"".

But let me confirm: ""BARED"" is a common word.

So the guess is ""BARED"".

But note: we are putting B at 1 and D at 5.

If the word is ""BARED"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But we have other options: ""PARED"", ""FARED"" (if accepted), etc.

But ""FARED"" is not common.

Another word: ""GARED"" is not common.

So the main options are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WAVED"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""JARED"" is not common.

So I think ""BARED"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BARED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M (excluded from the word).
- **Known present letters**: A, R, E (with positions locked).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list (available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E ?`.
- Common candidates include:
  - **BARED**: B at 1, D at 5
  - **PARED**: P at 1, D at 5
  - **FARED**: F at 1, D at 5 (less common)
- ""BARED"" tests **B** and **D**, which are high-frequency letters. ""PARED"" tests **P** and **D**. 

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **BARED** to test **B** and **D** efficiently. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if B or D is present and in the right position, narrowing to ""PARED"" or other candidates.

### Why ""BARED""?
- Tests **B** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both new and common letters.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback will reveal:
  - If **B** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
  - If **D** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
- This will pinpoint the solution to ""PARED"" or another candidate (e.g., ""FARED"" if valid).

And we haven\'t tested L and T.\n\n But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn\'t have C or N.\n\n However, let\'s check the positions in ""LATER"":\n   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.\n\n But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.\n\n However, we must consider the feedback: \n   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.\n   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so allowed.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""LATER"". But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? \n\n For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we must avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARE""? \n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) \n\n Let me think of common words.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.\n   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). \n   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ARISE""? \n   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n In ""ARISE"": \n   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don\'t know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).\n   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""RAZED""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.\n   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).\n\n But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.\n\n However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.\n\n Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: \n   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). \n   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). \n\n But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   E at 1: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? (it wasn\'t at 5, so 1 is allowed)\n   A at 2: we don\'t know if A can be at 2? (it wasn\'t at 3, so 2 is allowed)\n   R at 3: we don\'t know if R can be at 3? (it wasn\'t at 2, so 3 is allowed)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don\'t have any information about position 1 for E? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we are also testing L and Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   A cannot be at position 3.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.\n\n Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.\n   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)\n   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.\n\n However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.\n\n But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.\n\n But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.\n   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.\n   R at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.\n\n Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.\n\n Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   A at 1 (not 3, okay)\n   E at 3 (not 5, okay)\n   R at 4 (not 2, okay)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n However, we are also testing L and T.\n\n Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   A at 1 (okay)\n   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)\n   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.\n\n Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That\'s a new position, so it\'s okay.\n\n Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).\n\n And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ALTER"".\n\n However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.\n\n But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n We must include E.\n\n So let\'s stick with ""ALTER"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.\n\n However, ""EARLY"": \n   E at 1 (not 5, okay)\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at 3 (not 2, okay)\n   L at 4, Y at 5.\n\n This also tests L and Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if Y is common? \n\n Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.\n   A at 2 (okay)\n   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)\n   E at 4 (okay, not 5)\n   But T at 1, S at 5.\n\n This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".\n\n Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.\n\n But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet, to get more information.\n\n We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.\n\n But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.\n\n In ""ALTER"": L and T.\n\n Both are good.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""TARES""\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TARES"".\n\n However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That\'s a new position.\n\n Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""TARES"" seems good.\n\n But let me check: \n   T at 1: we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know about position 2.\n   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.\n   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.\n   S at 5: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess: ""TARES""\n\n<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-"").

We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fifth letters.\n\nThe first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nWe know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?\n\nWe need to fill in the first and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\nFrom the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.\n\nNow, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we don\'t have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it\'s possible to have duplicates? But we don\'t have any indication. So we\'ll assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\nSo the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.\n\nWe need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nCommon words that fit:\n\n- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don\'t have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? But we haven\'t been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two R\'s, then in the first guess we would have seen two R\'s? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it\'s correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a \'-\' for the R in the second guess? But we didn\'t have another R in the second guess. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut let\'s check the word ""LATER"": \n  L at 1: we don\'t know if L is in the word? \n  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.\n\n""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.\n\nAnother word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R\'s? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.\n\nBut we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let\'s think of more common words.\n\nAnother word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R\'s and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nSo the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?\n\nCommon words:\n- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.\n- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: ?\n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: R (fixed)\n  Position 4: E (fixed)\n  Position 5: ?\n\nThe word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.\n\nWe know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E\'s? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E\'s, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it\'s valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).\n\nBut we can also think of other words without duplicates.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R\'s.\n\n- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.\n\n- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R\'s.\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.\n\nBut we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.\n\nSo ""HAREM"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""WARER""? Not a common word.\n\n""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.\n\nWe need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).\n\nExcluded letters: C, N, T, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.\n\n- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.\n\n- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It\'s the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let\'s see.\n\n- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.\n\n- ""LARED"": not common.\n\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n\n- ""HAREM"" is the most common.\n\nBut we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that\'s B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it\'s not as common.\n\n""HAREM"" is more common.\n\nBut we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.\n\nSo the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nBut we must check if they meet the criteria.\n\n""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.\n\n""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.\n\nBut we need to see if they are valid words.\n\nWe can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.\n\nAnother word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.\n\n""BARER"" -> duplicate R.\n\nSo without duplicates, we have:\n\n- ""HAREM"" (common)\n- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let\'s see.\n\n""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It\'s a verb.\n\nBut ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.\n\nBut we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.\n\nSo the candidates are:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5\n- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5\n\nWe need to test one of these.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider if there are more words.\n\nWhat about ""WARED""? Not common.\n\n""YARED""? Not common.\n\n""ZARED""? Not common.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".\n\n""HAREM"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.\n\nWe can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.\n\nAnother word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven\'t excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).\n\nBut we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.\n\nBut it has two R\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARER"" has two R\'s.\n\nSo if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is not as common.\n\nWe can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.\n\n""HAREM"" is the best.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.\n\nWe can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven\'t tried? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.\n\nSo the guess is ""HAREM"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n  H at 1: we don\'t know.\n  A at 2: correct (we know)\n  R at 3: correct (we know)\n  E at 4: correct (we know)\n  M at 5: we don\'t know.\n\nIf the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nBut we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WARED"" but it\'s obscure.\n\nI think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: \n  - C and N are absent (x).\n  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: \n    - R cannot be in position 2.\n    - A cannot be in position 3.\n    - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:\n  - T and S are absent (x).\n  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:\n    - A is in position 2 (correct).\n    - R is in position 3 (correct).\n    - E is in position 4 (correct).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).\n- The first and fifth letters are unknown.\n- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.\n- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.\n- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.\n- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:\n  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)\n  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)\n  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)\n- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.\n\n### Why ""HAREM""?\n- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).\n\n<guess>harem</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""harem""\n  H: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ \n   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.\n   - So the word is: ? A R E ?\n\n2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.\n\n3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.\n- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)\n- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).\n- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.\n- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D\'s? Actually, it\'s D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).\n- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.\n- ""GARED"": not a common word.\n- ""JARED"": not common.\n- ""KARED"": not a word.\n- ""LARED"": not standard.\n- ""PARED"": as above.\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n\nSo the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R\'s and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.\n\nAnother word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven\'t excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don\'t have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:\n  P at 1: we don\'t know.\n  A at 2: correct.\n  R at 3: correct.\n  E at 4: correct.\n  R at 5: if the word has two R\'s, then it might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it\'s correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R\'s, then it might be okay.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.\n\nBut we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. \n\nWe can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn\'t have E at position 4? It\'s B A R O N, which doesn\'t have E at position 4.\n\nWe must have E at position 4.\n\nSo the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": not common.\n\nSo we have two strong candidates.\n\nWe need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word. We have to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.\n\nIf we guess ""BARED"" and it\'s not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" for P and D.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nWe can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don\'t have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.\n\nThe pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.\n\nSo the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.\n\nOther words? \n\n- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.\n- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R\'s? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.\n\nBut ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.\n\nBut note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it\'s duplicated).\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get:\n\nIf the secret word is ""PARER"", then:\n  P: ? \n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the last letter is R.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".\n\nI think it\'s safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. \n\nWe can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""BARED"".\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.\n\nIf we guess ""BARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.\n\nWe can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn\'t fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.\n\nAnother idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.\n\nSo we cannot change that.\n\nWe must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.\n\nSo the only flexibility is the first and last letters.\n\nWe can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.\n\nWe can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".\n\nI think we should try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

Guess 4: ""bared""
  B: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  D: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, from the feedback of guess 4, we see that D is correct at position 5. Also, B is absent. So the word is almost solved.

The feedback for ""bared"":
  B: x -> not in the word.
  A: ✓ -> correct at position 2.
  R: ✓ -> correct at position 3.
  E: ✓ -> correct at position 4.
  D: ✓ -> correct at position 5.

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ A R E D

We know the first letter is not B, and the word ends with D.

Now, we need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (from the x's in all guesses).

Also, we know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

So the word is: ? A R E D

We need to find the first letter, which must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S, H, M, B} and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, which we have no evidence for, so we'll assume no duplicates).

Possible letters for the first position: 
  We have 26 letters minus the excluded ones and the known letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we'll avoid.

Available letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note D is already at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it would be duplicate? But we don't know.

But we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider the possibility.

But let's list possible words:

- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but that would be two D's. Is ""dared"" a word? Yes, meaning dared or encouraged. And it has D at 1 and 5.

But we have D at 5 correct, so if we put D at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two D's.

Similarly, we can have:
- ""FARED"": F at 1, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated. Not common.
- ""GARED"": not common.
- ""LARED"": not common.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5 -> ""pared"" means trimmed or dressed. Common word.
- ""WARED"": not common.
- ""YARED"": not common.

But ""PARED"" is a common word.

Also, ""DARED"" is a word.

But we have to check if they are valid.

We also have ""BARED"": but B is excluded, and ""bared"" is not common? Actually, ""bared"" might be a variant of barre, but not standard.

Another word: ""CARED"": C excluded.

So the main candidates are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can also consider ""JARED"": not common.

Or ""KARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We need to choose one.

We can try ""PARED"" first.

But note: we have to make sure that P is not excluded? It is not in the excluded list.

Similarly, for ""DARED"", D is already known to be at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it's duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we can try one.

We can try ""PARED"".

If we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not P, and the word is likely ""DARED"".

But we have only one guess left after this? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after this? Total 6, so we have two more after this.

But if we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can guess ""DARED"" next.

But we can also consider: what if the word is ""FARED""? But ""FARED"" is not common.

Or ""LARED"": not common.

So the only common words are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can also check: ""WARED"" is not common.

So I think we should try ""PARED"".

But let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a 5-letter word: P-A-R-E-D.

Pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

But in ""DARED"", the first letter is D, which is the same as the last letter? So duplicate D.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a duplicate marked. However, we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But in the first guess, we had no duplicates. In the second and third guesses, no duplicates. In the fourth guess, we had no duplicates.

So it's possible that the word has duplicates? But we don't have any indication.

However, in the fourth guess, we had ""bared"" which has no duplicates, and D was correct at 5.

So if the word is ""dared"", then in ""bared"", the D at 5 was correct, but the D at 1 in ""dared"" would have been marked as present? But in ""bared"", we didn't have a D at 1? We had B at 1.

In ""bared"", we had:
  B: x (absent)
  A: ✓ (correct)
  R: ✓ (correct)
  E: ✓ (correct)
  D: ✓ (correct)

So the D at 5 is accounted for, but if the word is ""dared"", then there is another D at 1. But in ""bared"", we didn't test a D at 1, so we don't know.

But the feedback for ""bared"" doesn't show any duplicate marks, so if the word had a duplicate D, we would have seen a '-' for the D in ""bared""? Actually, no, because in ""bared"", we only have one D (at position 5). So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we got:
  B: absent (x)
  A: correct (✓)
  R: correct (✓)
  E: correct (✓)
  D: correct (✓)

But in ""dared"", the first letter is D, so when we guessed ""bared"", the D at 5 is correct, and the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn't guess a D at 1. So we don't get feedback for the D at 1.

So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, we have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"" to test P.

If we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can try ""DARED"" next.

But we have two guesses left after this (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after).

So we can try ""PARED"".

But let's see: if we guess ""PARED"", and the word is ""DARED"", then we get:
  P: x (absent)
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓ (because it matches the D at 5)

But we would know that the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D (so the word must be ""DARED"").

Similarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not D (because we got D correct at 5, but if the first letter is D, then we would have gotten a duplicate mark? Actually, in ""bared"", when we had D at 5 correct, we don't know about the first letter D because we didn't guess it there.

In ""bared"", we didn't have a D at position 1. So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we should have:
  B: x
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓  -> because the D at 5 is matched, but the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn't guess a D at 1, so we don't get feedback for it. So we cannot tell from the feedback of ""bared"" that D is also at 1? Actually, we don't have any information about the first letter of ""dared"" because we didn't guess a D at position 1 in any guess? We guessed ""crane"" (no D), ""tares"" (no D), ""harem"" (no D), ""bared"" (no D at 1). So we have no feedback that D is at position 1? But we didn't test it.

So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, we have two possibilities: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"" as the next guess.

If it's not, then we try ""DARED"".

But we have two guesses left (this is guess 5, and we have two more after if needed).

So let's try ""PARED"".

But note: we are on the fifth guess. We can also try ""DARED"" now? But we want to use a guess to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests multiple letters? But we only have two positions: first and last. And we have two candidates. We can try one.

We can try ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""PARED"".

But let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a valid word.

So the guess is ""PARED"".

But if the word is ""DARED"", then we get:
  P: x (absent)
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓  (because it matches the D at 5)

Then we would know the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D. So the word must be ""DARED"".

Similarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and the word is ""PARED"", then we get:
  D: x (absent) at position 1? But wait, in ""PARED"", the first letter is P, so D would be absent? And we would get:
  D: x (if the word is ""PARED"", then D is at 5, but not at 1) -> so D: x, and P: ? 
  But in ""PARED"", P is at 1, so if we guess ""DARED"", then:
    D at 1: if the word is ""PARED"", then D is absent? But we know D is present at 5, so if the word has only one D, then D at 1 would be absent. But if the word has two D's? Then D at 1 might be present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated.

But note: we have the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. So the word ends with D.

And we know the first letter is not B (from ""bared"" feedback: B x).

Now, if we guess ""DARED"", and the word is ""PARED"", then:
  D at 1: absent (x) because the first letter of ""PARED"" is P, not D.
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓ at 5.

So we get: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)

But then we know the first letter is not D, and we can try ""PARED"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""PARED"" and the word is ""DARED"", we get:
  P: x (absent) at position 1? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓

So we know P is absent, and D is at 5. Then we try ""DARED"".

But we have two guesses left, so we can do this.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests the first position with a letter that is not D? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that has a different letter at 1 and a letter we haven't tried at 5? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We cannot change the fixed positions 2,3,4.

So we must have A, R, E at 2,3,4, and then a letter at 1 and 5.

We have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"".

But let's see if there are other words?

What about ""LARED""? Not common.

""FARED"": not common.

""GARED"": not common.

So only two possibilities.

We can also consider ""CARED"": but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So I think we should try ""PARED"".

Therefore, we guess ""PARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. P is not excluded, and D is at 5, which is correct.

So the guess is ""PARED"".

But if we are wrong, we have one more guess for ""DARED"" on the sixth guess.

So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: A, R, E, D).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (excluded from the word).
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E D`.
- Common candidates:
  - **PARED**: P at position 1, D at position 5.
  - **DARED**: D at position 1, D at position 5 (duplicate D).
- ""PARED"" tests **P** at position 1, a new letter. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if P is present (though unlikely at position 1) or absent, leaving ""DARED"" as the only common solution.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **PARED** to test **P**. If incorrect, the solution must be ""DARED"" (since it's the only other common word fitting the pattern and exclusions).

### Why ""PARED""?
- Tests **P** (position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present (though unlikely, as we have no evidence of duplicates).
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, we deduce the word is ""DARED"" and use Guess 6.

    D at 1: if the word is ""PARED"", then D is absent? But we know D is present at 5, so if the word has only one D, then D at 1 would be absent. But if the word has two D's? Then D at 1 might be present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated.

But note: we have the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. So the word ends with D.

And we know the first letter is not B (from ""bared"" feedback: B x).

Now, if we guess ""DARED"", and the word is ""PARED"", then:
  D at 1: absent (x) because the first letter of ""PARED"" is P, not D.
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓ at 5.

So we get: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)

But then we know the first letter is not D, and we can try ""PARED"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""PARED"" and the word is ""DARED"", we get:
  P: x (absent) at position 1? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓

So we know P is absent, and D is at 5. Then we try ""DARED"".

But we have two guesses left, so we can do this.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests the first position with a letter that is not D? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that has a different letter at 1 and a letter we haven't tried at 5? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We cannot change the fixed positions 2,3,4.

So we must have A, R, E at 2,3,4, and then a letter at 1 and 5.

We have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"".

But let's see if there are other words?

What about ""LARED""? Not common.

""FARED"": not common.

""GARED"": not common.

So only two possibilities.

We can also consider ""CARED"": but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So I think we should try ""PARED"".

Therefore, we guess ""PARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. P is not excluded, and D is at 5, which is correct.

So the guess is ""PARED"".

But if we are wrong, we have one more guess for ""DARED"" on the sixth guess.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: A, R, E, D).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (excluded from the word).
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E D`.
- Common candidates:
  - **PARED**: P at position 1, D at position 5.
  - **DARED**: D at position 1, D at position 5 (duplicate D).
- ""PARED"" tests **P** at position 1, a new letter. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if P is present (though unlikely at position 1) or absent, leaving ""DARED"" as the only common solution.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **PARED** to test **P**. If incorrect, the solution must be ""DARED"" (since it's the only other common word fitting the pattern and exclusions).

### Why ""PARED""?
- Tests **P** (position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present (though unlikely, as we have no evidence of duplicates).
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, we deduce the word is ""DARED"" and use Guess 6.",Guess 5: pared -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know R, A, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them elsewhere.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or N.

 We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

 We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or N.
   - Contains R, A, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback says they are in the word but not in the positions we guessed. So for R, it cannot be in position 2; for A, cannot be in position 3; for E, cannot be in position 5).

 However, note: the feedback does not prevent them from appearing again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet. We'll assume no duplicates for now until we get more feedback.

 We also need to avoid using C and N.

 Let's think of words that have R, A, E and two new letters (to test).

 We have to place R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   - R was in position 2 -> wrong position, so R is not at position 2.
   - A was in position 3 -> wrong position, so A is not at position 3.
   - E was in position 5 -> wrong position, so E is not at position 5.

 But note: it's possible that R, A, E appear again? But we don't have any duplicate letters in the feedback. So we'll assume they appear once.

 We need to choose a word that has R, A, E and two other letters (that are not C or N) and that places R, A, E in positions that are not 2, 3, 5? Actually, we can place them in any position except the ones we tried? But note: we don't know the total number of positions. The word has 5 positions.

 However, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 Let me try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize information by using common letters.

 Also, we know the word must have R, A, E.

 Let me try to form a word:

 We can try to put R in a different position. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
 E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.

 However, we don't know the correct positions yet.

 Let's try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don't know if L and T are in the word? And we haven't tested L and T.

 But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn't have C or N.

 However, let's check the positions in ""LATER"":
   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.

 But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.

 But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.

 However, we must consider the feedback: 
   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.
   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.

 But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That's a new position, so it's allowed.

 Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that's a new position, so allowed.

 However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 So, let's consider ""LATER"". But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.

 Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? 

 For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we must avoid putting E at position 5.

 Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STARE""? 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) 

 Let me think of common words.

 Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.
   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). 
   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ARISE""? 
   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 In ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don't know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).
   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.
   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don't know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.
   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don't know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).

 But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.

 However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.

 Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: 
   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). 
   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). 

 But we don't know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.

 Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.
   E at 1: we don't know if E can be at 1? (it wasn't at 5, so 1 is allowed)
   A at 2: we don't know if A can be at 2? (it wasn't at 3, so 2 is allowed)
   R at 3: we don't know if R can be at 3? (it wasn't at 2, so 3 is allowed)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don't have any information about position 1 for E? So it's okay.

 However, we are also testing L and Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 We must include R, A, E.

 So let's list the constraints for the next guess:
   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).
   R cannot be at position 2.
   A cannot be at position 3.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.

 Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.
   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)
   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.

 However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.

 But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.

 But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.
   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.
   R at position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.

 How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.

 Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.

 Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.
   A at 1 (not 3, okay)
   E at 3 (not 5, okay)
   R at 4 (not 2, okay)

 This seems acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 However, we are also testing L and T.

 Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
   A at 1 (okay)
   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)
   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)

 This is acceptable.

 But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.

 Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.

 However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.

 But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That's a new position, so it's okay.

 Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).

 And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).

 So let's go with ""ALTER"".

 However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we'll get feedback.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.

 But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.

 Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.

 We must include E.

 So let's stick with ""ALTER"".

 But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.

 However, ""EARLY"": 
   E at 1 (not 5, okay)
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   R at 3 (not 2, okay)
   L at 4, Y at 5.

 This also tests L and Y.

 But we don't know if Y is common? 

 Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.
   A at 2 (okay)
   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)
   E at 4 (okay, not 5)
   But T at 1, S at 5.

 This is also acceptable.

 But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don't know if that's correct.

 We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".

 Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.

 But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven't tried yet, to get more information.

 We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.

 So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.

 But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.

 In ""ALTER"": L and T.

 Both are good.

 I'll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.

 So my second guess: ""TARES""

 But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

 So let's choose ""TARES"".

 However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven't tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That's a new position.

 Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.

 So ""TARES"" seems good.

 But let me check: 
   T at 1: we don't know if T is in the word.
   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don't know about position 2.
   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.
   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.
   S at 5: we don't know.

 This guess: ""TARES""

<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - R cannot be in position 2.
  - A cannot be in position 3.
  - E cannot be in position 5.

For the second guess, I prioritized:
1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.
2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.
3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.
4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:
   - R now in position 3 (not 2).
   - A now in position 2 (not 3).
   - E now in position 4 (not 5).

The word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.

<guess>tares</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   So the word is: _ A R E _
   We know the first and last letters are missing.

2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x's).

3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters.

The first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

Similarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried and is not excluded.

We know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?

We need to fill in the first and fifth positions.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.

From the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.

Now, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we don't have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it's possible to have duplicates? But we don't have any indication. So we'll assume no duplicates for simplicity.

So the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.

Similarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.

We need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _

Common words that fit:

- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don't have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? But we haven't been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen two R's? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don't know.

But let's look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a '-' for the R in the second guess? But we didn't have another R in the second guess. So we don't know.

But we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.

But let's check the word ""LATER"": 
  L at 1: we don't know if L is in the word? 
  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.

""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.

Another word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R's? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.

But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.

But note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let's think of more common words.

Another word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R's and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: _ A R E _

So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?

Common words:
- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.
- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: 
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: R (fixed)
  Position 4: E (fixed)
  Position 5: ?

The word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.

We know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E's? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E's, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E's? But we don't know.

But to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

But let's list possible words:

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R's? And we don't know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it's valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).

But we can also think of other words without duplicates.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R's.

- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.

- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R's.

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.

But wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.

But we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven't tested them.

But note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.

So ""HAREM"" is a candidate.

But let me see if there are other words without duplicates.

What about ""WARER""? Not a common word.

""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.

We need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.

- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.

- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.

- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.

- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It's the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let's see.

- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.

- ""LARED"": not common.

- ""WARED"": not common.

- ""HAREM"" is the most common.

But we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that's B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

Similarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.

""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it's not as common.

""HAREM"" is more common.

But we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.

So the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

But we must check if they meet the criteria.

""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.

""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.

But we need to see if they are valid words.

We can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.

Another word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.

""BARER"" -> duplicate R.

So without duplicates, we have:

- ""HAREM"" (common)
- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)

But we have to choose one.

We also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.

""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.

But note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".

But we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It's a verb.

But ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.

But we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.

We can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.

So the candidates are:

- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5
- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5

We need to test one of these.

But we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.

But note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it's not the word, we get feedback on H and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one.

We can also consider if there are more words.

What about ""WARED""? Not common.

""YARED""? Not common.

""ZARED""? Not common.

So the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".

""HAREM"" is a common word.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.

We can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.

Another word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

But in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it's correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don't know.

But ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).

But we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.

But it has two R's.

Similarly, ""PARER"" has two R's.

So if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".

We can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn't fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.

Another word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.

So the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?

So the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".

But ""PARED"" is not as common.

We can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.

""HAREM"" is the best.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.

We can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.

So let's go with ""HAREM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.

We have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.

But we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.

Similarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.

We can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven't tried? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.

But let's see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""HAREM"".

But note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.

So the guess is ""HAREM"".

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct (we know)
  R at 3: correct (we know)
  E at 4: correct (we know)
  M at 5: we don't know.

If the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.

If not, we get feedback on H and M.

But we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WARED"" but it's obscure.

I think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
  - C and N are absent (x).
  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: 
    - R cannot be in position 2.
    - A cannot be in position 3.
    - E cannot be in position 5.

- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:
  - T and S are absent (x).
  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:
    - A is in position 2 (correct).
    - R is in position 3 (correct).
    - E is in position 4 (correct).

### Analysis:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- The first and fifth letters are unknown.
- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.
- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).

### Strategy for the next guess:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.
- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.
- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:
  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)
  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)
  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)
- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.

### Why ""HAREM""?
- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).

<guess>harem</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ 
   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.
   - So the word is: ? A R E ?

2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.

3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.

Now, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.
- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D's? Actually, it's D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).
- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.
- ""GARED"": not a common word.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not a word.
- ""LARED"": not standard.
- ""PARED"": as above.
- ""WARED"": not common.

So the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R's and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.

Another word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven't excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don't have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.

But let's see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:
  P at 1: we don't know.
  A at 2: correct.
  R at 3: correct.
  E at 4: correct.
  R at 5: if the word has two R's, then it might be correct? But we don't know.

However, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it's correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R's, then it might be okay.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.

But we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. 

We can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn't have E at position 4? It's B A R O N, which doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have E at position 4.

So the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates.

We need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.

Similarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.

But we don't know if D is in the word. We have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.

We can try ""PARED"" for P and D.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don't have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.

The pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.

Other words? 

- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.
- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R's? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.

But ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.

But note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it's duplicated).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word is ""PARER"", then:
  P: ? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R's.

But we don't know if the last letter is R.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".

I think it's safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.

We have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. 

We can try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.

So let's guess ""BARED"".

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.

If we guess ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn't fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.

Another idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.

So we cannot change that.

We must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.

So the only flexibility is the first and last letters.

We can try ""BARED"".

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.

We can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".

I think we should try ""BARED"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the word is ""PARER""? Then we haven't considered duplicates.

But let's see: if we try ""BARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.

But we have two more guesses after this, so it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at the end to test? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BARED"".

So I'll go with ""BARED"".

But let me confirm: ""BARED"" is a common word.

So the guess is ""BARED"".

But note: we are putting B at 1 and D at 5.

If the word is ""BARED"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But we have other options: ""PARED"", ""FARED"" (if accepted), etc.

But ""FARED"" is not common.

Another word: ""GARED"" is not common.

So the main options are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".

We can also consider ""WAVED"" but it doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""JARED"" is not common.

So I think ""BARED"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""BARED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M (excluded from the word).
- **Known present letters**: A, R, E (with positions locked).
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list (available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E ?`.
- Common candidates include:
  - **BARED**: B at 1, D at 5
  - **PARED**: P at 1, D at 5
  - **FARED**: F at 1, D at 5 (less common)
- ""BARED"" tests **B** and **D**, which are high-frequency letters. ""PARED"" tests **P** and **D**. 

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Prioritize **BARED** to test **B** and **D** efficiently. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if B or D is present and in the right position, narrowing to ""PARED"" or other candidates.

### Why ""BARED""?
- Tests **B** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both new and common letters.
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback will reveal:
  - If **B** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
  - If **D** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).
- This will pinpoint the solution to ""PARED"" or another candidate (e.g., ""FARED"" if valid).

<guess>bared</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)
Guess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)
Guess 4: bared -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)
  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""tares""
  T: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  S: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""harem""
  H: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  M: x (not in the word)

Guess 4: ""bared""
  B: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  D: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, from the feedback of guess 4, we see that D is correct at position 5. Also, B is absent. So the word is almost solved.

The feedback for ""bared"":
  B: x -> not in the word.
  A: ✓ -> correct at position 2.
  R: ✓ -> correct at position 3.
  E: ✓ -> correct at position 4.
  D: ✓ -> correct at position 5.

This means the secret word has the pattern: _ A R E D

We know the first letter is not B, and the word ends with D.

Now, we need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Excluded letters so far: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (from the x's in all guesses).

Also, we know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

So the word is: ? A R E D

We need to find the first letter, which must be a letter not in {C, N, T, S, H, M, B} and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, which we have no evidence for, so we'll assume no duplicates).

Possible letters for the first position: 
  We have 26 letters minus the excluded ones and the known letters? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we'll avoid.

Available letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note D is already at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it would be duplicate? But we don't know.

But we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider the possibility.

But let's list possible words:

- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but that would be two D's. Is ""dared"" a word? Yes, meaning dared or encouraged. And it has D at 1 and 5.

But we have D at 5 correct, so if we put D at 1, it might be duplicate? But we don't know if the word has two D's.

Similarly, we can have:
- ""FARED"": F at 1, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated. Not common.
- ""GARED"": not common.
- ""LARED"": not common.
- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5 -> ""pared"" means trimmed or dressed. Common word.
- ""WARED"": not common.
- ""YARED"": not common.

But ""PARED"" is a common word.

Also, ""DARED"" is a word.

But we have to check if they are valid.

We also have ""BARED"": but B is excluded, and ""bared"" is not common? Actually, ""bared"" might be a variant of barre, but not standard.

Another word: ""CARED"": C excluded.

So the main candidates are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can also consider ""JARED"": not common.

Or ""KARED"": not common.

So we have two strong candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We need to choose one.

We can try ""PARED"" first.

But note: we have to make sure that P is not excluded? It is not in the excluded list.

Similarly, for ""DARED"", D is already known to be at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it's duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we can try one.

We can try ""PARED"".

If we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know that the first letter is not P, and the word is likely ""DARED"".

But we have only one guess left after this? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after this? Total 6, so we have two more after this.

But if we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can guess ""DARED"" next.

But we can also consider: what if the word is ""FARED""? But ""FARED"" is not common.

Or ""LARED"": not common.

So the only common words are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can also check: ""WARED"" is not common.

So I think we should try ""PARED"".

But let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a 5-letter word: P-A-R-E-D.

Pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This matches the pattern.

Similarly, ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

But in ""DARED"", the first letter is D, which is the same as the last letter? So duplicate D.

We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback so far, we haven't seen a duplicate marked. However, we don't have evidence against duplicates.

But in the first guess, we had no duplicates. In the second and third guesses, no duplicates. In the fourth guess, we had no duplicates.

So it's possible that the word has duplicates? But we don't have any indication.

However, in the fourth guess, we had ""bared"" which has no duplicates, and D was correct at 5.

So if the word is ""dared"", then in ""bared"", the D at 5 was correct, but the D at 1 in ""dared"" would have been marked as present? But in ""bared"", we didn't have a D at 1? We had B at 1.

In ""bared"", we had:
  B: x (absent)
  A: ✓ (correct)
  R: ✓ (correct)
  E: ✓ (correct)
  D: ✓ (correct)

So the D at 5 is accounted for, but if the word is ""dared"", then there is another D at 1. But in ""bared"", we didn't test a D at 1, so we don't know.

But the feedback for ""bared"" doesn't show any duplicate marks, so if the word had a duplicate D, we would have seen a '-' for the D in ""bared""? Actually, no, because in ""bared"", we only have one D (at position 5). So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we got:
  B: absent (x)
  A: correct (✓)
  R: correct (✓)
  E: correct (✓)
  D: correct (✓)

But in ""dared"", the first letter is D, so when we guessed ""bared"", the D at 5 is correct, and the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn't guess a D at 1. So we don't get feedback for the D at 1.

So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, we have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"" to test P.

If we guess ""PARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can try ""DARED"" next.

But we have two guesses left after this (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after).

So we can try ""PARED"".

But let's see: if we guess ""PARED"", and the word is ""DARED"", then we get:
  P: x (absent)
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓ (because it matches the D at 5)

But we would know that the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D (so the word must be ""DARED"").

Similarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and it's wrong, then we know the first letter is not D (because we got D correct at 5, but if the first letter is D, then we would have gotten a duplicate mark? Actually, in ""bared"", when we had D at 5 correct, we don't know about the first letter D because we didn't guess it there.

In ""bared"", we didn't have a D at position 1. So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we should have:
  B: x
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓  -> because the D at 5 is matched, but the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn't guess a D at 1, so we don't get feedback for it. So we cannot tell from the feedback of ""bared"" that D is also at 1? Actually, we don't have any information about the first letter of ""dared"" because we didn't guess a D at position 1 in any guess? We guessed ""crane"" (no D), ""tares"" (no D), ""harem"" (no D), ""bared"" (no D at 1). So we have no feedback that D is at position 1? But we didn't test it.

So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, we have two possibilities: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"" as the next guess.

If it's not, then we try ""DARED"".

But we have two guesses left (this is guess 5, and we have two more after if needed).

So let's try ""PARED"".

But note: we are on the fifth guess. We can also try ""DARED"" now? But we want to use a guess to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests multiple letters? But we only have two positions: first and last. And we have two candidates. We can try one.

We can try ""PARED"".

So I'll go with ""PARED"".

But let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a valid word.

So the guess is ""PARED"".

But if the word is ""DARED"", then we get:
  P: x (absent)
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓  (because it matches the D at 5)

Then we would know the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D. So the word must be ""DARED"".

Similarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and the word is ""PARED"", then we get:
  D: x (absent) at position 1? But wait, in ""PARED"", the first letter is P, so D would be absent? And we would get:
  D: x (if the word is ""PARED"", then D is at 5, but not at 1) -> so D: x, and P: ? 
  But in ""PARED"", P is at 1, so if we guess ""DARED"", then:
    D at 1: if the word is ""PARED"", then D is absent? But we know D is present at 5, so if the word has only one D, then D at 1 would be absent. But if the word has two D's? Then D at 1 might be present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated.

But note: we have the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. So the word ends with D.

And we know the first letter is not B (from ""bared"" feedback: B x).

Now, if we guess ""DARED"", and the word is ""PARED"", then:
  D at 1: absent (x) because the first letter of ""PARED"" is P, not D.
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓ at 5.

So we get: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)

But then we know the first letter is not D, and we can try ""PARED"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""PARED"" and the word is ""DARED"", we get:
  P: x (absent) at position 1? 
  A: ✓
  R: ✓
  E: ✓
  D: ✓

So we know P is absent, and D is at 5. Then we try ""DARED"".

But we have two guesses left, so we can do this.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests the first position with a letter that is not D? But we don't have many options.

We can try ""PARED"" to test P.

But we can also try a word that has a different letter at 1 and a letter we haven't tried at 5? But we are constrained by the pattern.

We cannot change the fixed positions 2,3,4.

So we must have A, R, E at 2,3,4, and then a letter at 1 and 5.

We have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".

We can try ""PARED"".

But let's see if there are other words?

What about ""LARED""? Not common.

""FARED"": not common.

""GARED"": not common.

So only two possibilities.

We can also consider ""CARED"": but C is excluded.

""JARED"": not common.

So I think we should try ""PARED"".

Therefore, we guess ""PARED"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. P is not excluded, and D is at 5, which is correct.

So the guess is ""PARED"".

But if we are wrong, we have one more guess for ""DARED"" on the sixth guess.

So let's do that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: A, R, E, D).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (excluded from the word).
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

### Analysis:
- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E D`.
- Common candidates:
  - **PARED**: P at position 1, D at position 5.
  - **DARED**: D at position 1, D at position 5 (duplicate D).
- ""PARED"" tests **P** at position 1, a new letter. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if P is present (though unlikely at position 1) or absent, leaving ""DARED"" as the only common solution.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- Prioritize **PARED** to test **P**. If incorrect, the solution must be ""DARED"" (since it's the only other common word fitting the pattern and exclusions).

### Why ""PARED""?
- Tests **P** (position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present (though unlikely, as we have no evidence of duplicates).
- If correct, the word is solved. If not, we deduce the word is ""DARED"" and use Guess 6.

Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n E was in position 5 and that was wrong, so we can try E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for each.\n\n However, we don\'t know the correct positions yet.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have R, A, E and two other letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LATER"" -> but we have L, A, T, E, R -> but we don\'t know if L and T are in the word? And we haven\'t tested L and T.\n\n But note: we must avoid using C and N. ""LATER"" doesn\'t have C or N.\n\n However, let\'s check the positions in ""LATER"":\n   L at position 1, A at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n\n But we know that in the first guess, R was in position 2 and that was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5? That might be okay.\n\n But we also know that A was in position 3 and wrong, so if we put A at position 2, that might be a new position.\n\n However, we must consider the feedback: \n   In the first guess, R was in position 2 -> wrong, so the correct position of R is not 2.\n   In ""LATER"", R is at position 5 -> that might be acceptable.\n\n But wait: what about the feedback for A? In the first guess, A was at position 3 -> wrong. In ""LATER"", A is at position 2. That\'s a new position, so it\'s allowed.\n\n Similarly, E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong. In ""LATER"", E is at position 4 -> that\'s a new position, so allowed.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate marks, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""LATER"". But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R, A, E. We can try to put R in position 1? \n\n For example: ""RAISE"" -> but we have R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5. But E is at position 5 again? And we know E is not at position 5 (from first feedback). So we cannot put E at position 5.\n\n So we must avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Similarly, we cannot put A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n In ""RAISE"", E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STARE""? \n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3 -> but A was in position 3 and we know that was wrong? So we cannot put A at position 3.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""STARE"", A is at position 3 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROATE""? (which is a word? I think not common) \n\n Let me think of common words.\n\n Another word: ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E.\n   A is at position 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), S(4), E(5). \n   But E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ARISE""? \n   A at 1, R at 2 -> but R was in position 2 in the first guess and that was wrong? So we cannot put R at position 2 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there? Actually, the feedback said R is in the word but not at position 2, so we must avoid position 2 for R? Yes, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n In ""ARISE"": \n   A at 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A? But we don\'t know if A can be at 1? The feedback only said position 3 was wrong for A, so 1 is allowed).\n   R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, ""ARISE"" is invalid because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""RAZED""? \n   R at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n   A is at position 2 (which is not 3, so okay) -> but we don\'t know if position 2 is correct for A? It might be.\n   R is at position 1 (which is not 2, so okay for R? Actually, we don\'t know if position 1 is correct for R? We are allowed to try).\n\n But note: we also have to avoid E at position 5? Here E is at position 4 -> okay.\n\n However, we are introducing Z and D, which are less common. Maybe we can do better.\n\n Another word: ""LATER"" again? But we saw the positions: \n   L(1), A(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). \n   A is at 2 (not 3, okay), E at 4 (not 5, okay), R at 5 (not 2, okay). \n\n But we don\'t know if L and T are in the word. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STEAR"" (a type of leaf) but that might be too obscure.\n\n Another common word: ""EARLY"" -> E at 1, A at 2, R at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n   E at 1: we don\'t know if E can be at 1? (it wasn\'t at 5, so 1 is allowed)\n   A at 2: we don\'t know if A can be at 2? (it wasn\'t at 3, so 2 is allowed)\n   R at 3: we don\'t know if R can be at 3? (it wasn\'t at 2, so 3 is allowed)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 1. We don\'t have any information about position 1 for E? So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we are also testing L and Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" -> but we don\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n We must include R, A, E.\n\n So let\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n   Must include R, A, E (each at least once, and we assume no duplicates for now).\n   R cannot be at position 2.\n   A cannot be at position 3.\n   E cannot be at position 5.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Let me try to form a word that meets these constraints and uses common letters.\n\n Idea: ""HAREM"" -> H, A, R, E, M.\n   A at position 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at position 3 (not 2, okay)\n   E at position 4 (not 5, okay)\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. Also, we are testing H and M.\n\n However, we know that the word has R, A, E. We are using them all.\n\n But wait: the word ""HAREM"" has 5 letters: H, A, R, E, M.\n\n But is ""HAREM"" a valid word? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARSE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Another word: ""BREAD"" -> B, R, E, A, D.\n   R at position 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.\n\n How about ""DREAM"" -> D, R, E, A, M.\n   R at position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""REAMS"" -> S at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is not allowed.\n\n How about ""SERAI"" (a type of inn) -> but obscure.\n\n Let me think of words that end with a letter that is not E? So E is not at the end.\n\n Word: ""ALERT"" -> A at 1, L at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5.\n   A at 1 (not 3, okay)\n   E at 3 (not 5, okay)\n   R at 4 (not 2, okay)\n\n This seems acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 1 and E at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n However, we are also testing L and T.\n\n Another word: ""ALTER"" -> A at 1, L at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5.\n   A at 1 (okay)\n   E at 4 (okay, because not 5)\n   R at 5 (okay, because not 2)\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n But we have to avoid using C and N, which we are.\n\n Let me choose ""ALTER"". It uses A, L, T, E, R.\n\n However, note that in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was wrong. Now we are putting R at position 5. Similarly, A was at 3 and now we are putting it at 1, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""ALTER"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But wait: what about the position of A? We know A is in the word but not at position 3. We are putting A at position 1. That\'s a new position, so it\'s okay.\n\n Similarly, R is at position 5 (previously at 2, which was wrong).\n\n And E is at position 4 (previously at 5, which was wrong).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ALTER"".\n\n However, note: we are also testing L and T. If they are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more vowels? But we already have three vowels? We have A, E, and R (which is a consonant). We might want to test more consonants.\n\n But ""ALTER"" uses L and T, which are common.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""ROBES"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n Word: ""RODEO"" -> but no E? We must include E.\n\n We must include E.\n\n So let\'s stick with ""ALTER"".\n\n But wait: what about the position of E? In ""ALTER"", E is at position 4. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""EARLY"" as I thought earlier.\n\n However, ""EARLY"": \n   E at 1 (not 5, okay)\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   R at 3 (not 2, okay)\n   L at 4, Y at 5.\n\n This also tests L and Y.\n\n But we don\'t know if Y is common? \n\n Another common word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S.\n   A at 2 (okay)\n   R at 3 (okay, because not 2)\n   E at 4 (okay, not 5)\n   But T at 1, S at 5.\n\n This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we are putting A at 2 and R at 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""ALTER"" and ""TARES"".\n\n Let me choose ""TARES"" because it uses more common letters? T, S are very common.\n\n But we already know that the word has R, A, E. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t tried yet, to get more information.\n\n We have already eliminated C and N. We have tested: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 - 5 = 21, but we know 3 are in the word (R, A, E) and we are including them.\n\n But we are also testing two new letters in ""TARES"": T and S.\n\n In ""ALTER"": L and T.\n\n Both are good.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TARES"" because it has S which is a very common letter.\n\n So my second guess: ""TARES""\n\n But wait: what if the word has duplicate letters? We are not accounting for that. But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TARES"".\n\n However, note: we are putting A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put R in a position we haven\'t tried? In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now we are trying R at position 3? That\'s a new position.\n\n Similarly, A was at 3 and now at 2, and E was at 5 and now at 4.\n\n So ""TARES"" seems good.\n\n But let me check: \n   T at 1: we don\'t know if T is in the word.\n   A at 2: we know A is in the word, but we don\'t know about position 2.\n   R at 3: we know R is in the word, not at 2, so 3 is a new position.\n   E at 4: we know E is in the word, not at 5, so 4 is new.\n   S at 5: we don\'t know.\n\n This guess: ""TARES""\n\n<guess>tares</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R**, **A**, and **E** are present but in incorrect positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:\n  - R cannot be in position 2.\n  - A cannot be in position 3.\n  - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the second guess, I prioritized:\n1. Including the confirmed letters **R**, **A**, and **E**.\n2. Avoiding **C** and **N**.\n3. Testing new common letters (**T**, **S**) to gather more information.\n4. Placing **R**, **A**, and **E** in positions that respect the feedback constraints:\n   - R now in position 3 (not 2).\n   - A now in position 2 (not 3).\n   - E now in position 4 (not 5).\n\nThe word **""tares""** fits these criteria and tests two new letters (**T**, **S**) while leveraging the known letters.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n  A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, in position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letters A, R, E in positions 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n   So the word is: _ A R E _\n   We know the first and last letters are missing.\n\n2. We know that C, N, T, S are not in the word (from the x\'s).\n\n3. We also know that R, A, E are in the word, and we have placed them correctly in positions 2, 3, 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fifth letters.\n\nThe first letter cannot be C, N, T, S (and also not the letters we know are absent from the first guess, but we only have exclusions for C and N from the first guess, and T and S from the second). Also, note that the first letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a letter that hasn\'t been tried and is not excluded.\n\nWe know the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, so the word is: ? A R E ?\n\nWe need to fill in the first and fifth positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, N, T, S.\n\nFrom the first guess, we had E in the word (but not at position 5) and now we have E at position 4, which is consistent.\n\nNow, what about the first letter? It must be a letter that is not C, N, T, S, and also not A, R, E (because we already have them, and we assume no duplicates? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now). However, we must be cautious: the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we don\'t have information about duplicates. But since we have three letters already and two positions left, it\'s possible to have duplicates? But we don\'t have any indication. So we\'ll assume no duplicates for simplicity.\n\nSo the first letter must be a new letter, not in {C, N, T, S, A, R, E}.\n\nSimilarly, the last letter must be a new letter, not in the same set.\n\nWe need to think of 5-letter words that have the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nCommon words that fit:\n\n- LATER: L at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have R at 5? And we know R is in the word, but we already have R at 3. Also, we have an R at 5? But the feedback from the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. Now we have R at 3 and 5? That might be possible. However, we must check the last letter: R. But we don\'t have any exclusion for R? Actually, we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice? But we haven\'t been told about duplicates. However, note that in the first guess, we had only one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if the word had two R\'s, then in the first guess we would have seen two R\'s? But we only had one R in ""crane"", so it might not show duplicates. But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s look at the feedback: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one R in the word, but it could be that there is another R? However, in the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it\'s correct. So if there were a second R, we would have seen a \'-\' for the R in the second guess? But we didn\'t have another R in the second guess. So we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can consider words that have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence, so we might avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut let\'s check the word ""LATER"": \n  L at 1: we don\'t know if L is in the word? \n  But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, N, T, S.\n\n""LATER"" has L, A, T, E, R -> but T is excluded (from the second guess, T is absent). So ""LATER"" is invalid because it contains T.\n\nAnother word: ""PARER"" -> but that has two R\'s? And the pattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5. But we have E at 4? And R at 3 and 5. But the pattern requires A at 2, R at 3, E at 4. So ""PARER"" has E at 4? Actually: P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). Yes, that matches.\n\nBut we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: the word ""PARER"" is not a common word? It might be accepted? But let\'s think of more common words.\n\nAnother word: ""BARRE"" (a ballet term) -> B, A, R, R, E -> but that has two R\'s and E at 5? But we need E at 4? Actually, ""BARRE"" is B(1), A(2), R(3), R(4), E(5). But we need E at 4, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: _ A R E _\n\nSo the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word with the pattern ? A R E ?\n\nCommon words:\n- ""LARGE"" -> L, A, R, G, E -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. So no.\n- ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: \n  Position 1: ?\n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: R (fixed)\n  Position 4: E (fixed)\n  Position 5: ?\n\nThe word must be of the form: X A R E Y, where X and Y are letters.\n\nWe know that Y cannot be E? Because in the first guess, E was at position 5 and was marked as present but wrong position. But now we have E at position 4, which is correct. So if the word had E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have seen two E\'s? But we only had one E in ""crane"" and it was marked as present. So if the word has only one E, then E is at 4. If it has two E\'s, then E could be at 5? But the feedback for the first guess: when we put E at 5, it was marked as present but wrong position. That means that there is an E in the word, but it might be at a different position. However, we now know that E is at position 4. So if there were an E at position 5, then the word would have two E\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if R is duplicated. Also, the last letter is R, which is not excluded? But we have to check if it\'s valid. ""Parer"" is a word (meaning one who parers, or a verb form?).\n\nBut we can also think of other words without duplicates.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> again, two R\'s.\n\n- ""CARER"": but C is excluded.\n\n- ""FARER"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> two R\'s.\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> but we have E at 4? Yes. And M is not excluded. Also, H is not excluded.\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the E is at 4, which is correct. But we have to check the first letter H and the last letter M.\n\nBut we also have to check if H and M are allowed? We haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C, N, T, S.\n\nSo ""HAREM"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""WARER""? Not a common word.\n\n""AREAS"" -> but S is excluded and also A at 1? But we need A at 2.\n\nWe need A at 2, so the first letter can be any letter that is not excluded and not A, R, E (assuming no duplicates).\n\nExcluded letters: C, N, T, S.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, common words:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, M at 5 -> valid.\n\n- ""PARER"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""BARER"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> duplicate R.\n\n- ""CARDS"": but C is excluded and S is excluded.\n\n- ""DARES"": but S is excluded.\n\n- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but ""FARED"" is not a common word? It\'s the past tense of fare, but not very common. However, Wordle might accept it? But let\'s see.\n\n- ""GARED"": G at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> not a common word.\n\n- ""LARED"": not common.\n\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n\n- ""HAREM"" is the most common.\n\nBut we also have ""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> but that\'s B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARED"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> acceptable? It means to have fare (as in fare well) in the past tense? But it\'s not as common.\n\n""HAREM"" is more common.\n\nBut we also have ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> duplicate R and E at 5? But we need E at 4.\n\nSo the common words are ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nBut we must check if they meet the criteria.\n\n""HAREM"": H, A, R, E, M -> H is not excluded, M is not excluded.\n\n""BARED"": B, A, R, E, D -> B and D are not excluded.\n\nBut we need to see if they are valid words.\n\nWe can also consider ""PARER"" but it has duplicate R.\n\nAnother word: ""WARER"" -> W, A, R, E, R -> duplicate R.\n\n""BARER"" -> duplicate R.\n\nSo without duplicates, we have:\n\n- ""HAREM"" (common)\n- ""BARED"" (less common but valid)\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have ""FARCE"" -> but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": J, A, R, E, D -> valid? Jared is a name, but ""JARED"" as a word? It might be accepted? But let\'s see.\n\n""HAREM"" is definitely a common word.\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. We can try ""HAREM"".\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess: first and last. And we have two candidates: ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"" but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""PARED"" -> P, A, R, E, D -> valid? Pared means trimmed or dressed? It\'s a verb.\n\nBut ""PARED"" has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5). Yes.\n\nBut we have to choose between ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", ""PARED"", ""FARED"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider ""MARRED"": M, A, R, R, E -> but that has E at 5? No, we need E at 4. So not.\n\nSo the candidates are:\n\n- ""HAREM"": H at 1, M at 5\n- ""BARED"": B at 1, D at 5\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5\n\nWe need to test one of these.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can try one of them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to test multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions to fill. We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" to test H and M.\n\nBut note: if we guess ""HAREM"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""BARED"", we test B and D.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider if there are more words.\n\nWhat about ""WARED""? Not common.\n\n""YARED""? Not common.\n\n""ZARED""? Not common.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and perhaps ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is less common than ""HAREM"".\n\n""HAREM"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was present but wrong. Now we have E at 4, so if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", the last letter is D.\n\nWe can also consider ""JARED"", but it might not be in the word list.\n\nAnother word: ""FARER"" -> but that has E at 4? F(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5). But then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven\'t excluded R at 5? But we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was present, and in the second guess we have R at 3 and it\'s correct. So if we put R at 5, it might be another occurrence? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""FARER"" is a word (one who fares).\n\nBut we have to avoid T? T is excluded, and ""FARER"" has no T? F, A, R, E, R -> no T.\n\nBut it has two R\'s.\n\nSimilarly, ""PARER"" has two R\'s.\n\nSo if we want to avoid duplicates, we have ""HAREM"" and ""BARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""LARGE"", but that doesn\'t fit because E must be at 4, but ""LARGE"" has E at 5.\n\nAnother word: ""MARRY"" -> M, A, R, R, Y -> but we need E at 4? No, we need E at 4.\n\nSo the pattern is fixed: ? A R E ?\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""HAREM"", ""BARED"", and ""PARED"".\n\nBut ""PARED"" is not as common.\n\nWe can also consider ""GARED"": G, A, R, E, D -> valid? It means to have dressed? Not common.\n\n""HAREM"" is the best.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not necessarily the solution but tests more letters? But we only have two positions, so we must guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""HAREM"" as a guess.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. H and M are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""BARED""? Then we get it wrong, but we have more tries.\n\nWe have 4 more guesses? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we are on the third guess.\n\nBut we can also consider: in the first guess, we had E at 5 and it was present, but now we have E at 4. So if the word is ""HAREM"", then the last letter is M, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, for ""BARED"", last letter is D.\n\nWe can also test a word that uses a different set of letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has the same pattern but uses letters we haven\'t tried? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" to test P and D.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: ""HAREM"" is more common than ""PARED"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HAREM"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that H and M are not excluded. They are not.\n\nSo the guess is ""HAREM"".\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \n  H at 1: we don\'t know.\n  A at 2: correct (we know)\n  R at 3: correct (we know)\n  E at 4: correct (we know)\n  M at 5: we don\'t know.\n\nIf the word is ""HAREM"", then we get it right.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on H and M.\n\nBut we have other candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WARED"" but it\'s obscure.\n\nI think ""HAREM"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: \n  - C and N are absent (x).\n  - R, A, and E are present but in the wrong positions (-). Specifically: \n    - R cannot be in position 2.\n    - A cannot be in position 3.\n    - E cannot be in position 5.\n\n- **Guess 2 (""tares"")**:\n  - T and S are absent (x).\n  - A, R, and E are correct and in the right positions (✓). Specifically:\n    - A is in position 2 (correct).\n    - R is in position 3 (correct).\n    - E is in position 4 (correct).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).\n- The first and fifth letters are unknown.\n- Excluded letters (absent from the word): **C, N, T, S**.\n- We know the word contains **R, A, E** (with A at position 2, R at 3, E at 4) and two unknown letters (one at position 1 and one at position 5).\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 5.\n- The word must be a valid 5-letter English word fitting `_ A R E _`.\n- Common words without excluded letters (C, N, T, S) include:\n  - **HAREM** (H at 1, M at 5)\n  - **BARED** (B at 1, D at 5)\n  - **PARED** (P at 1, D at 5)\n- ""HAREM"" is a high-frequency word and tests new common letters (H and M). If incorrect, the feedback will reveal whether H or M is present and in the right position.\n\n### Why ""HAREM""?\n- It tests H at position 1 and M at position 5.\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on H and M will narrow down possibilities (e.g., if H is absent, ""BARED"" or ""PARED"" become top candidates).\n\n<guess>harem</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""harem""\n  H: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the pattern: _ A R E _ \n   - Position 2 is A, position 3 is R, position 4 is E.\n   - So the word is: ? A R E ?\n\n2. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, N, T, S, H, M.\n\n3. We also know that the letters R, A, E are in the word, and we have them in the correct positions.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fifth letters. The first letter must be a letter that is not in the excluded list, and the fifth letter must also not be in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word of the form ? A R E ?\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit this pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BARED"": B at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> B and D are available.\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> P and D are available.\n- ""LARED"": not a common word? (meaning? - to lard, or resembling lard. Not standard.)\n- ""WARED"": not common (meaning: to wane or decrease in amount or intensity).\n- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.\n- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but D is available, but ""DARED"" has two D\'s? Actually, it\'s D, A, R, E, D -> so the last letter is D. But ""DARED"" is a word (meaning dared or encouraged one to do something).\n- ""FARED"": F at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""fared"" is an archaic word for navigated, but not common. We should stick to common words.\n- ""GARED"": not a common word.\n- ""JARED"": not common.\n- ""KARED"": not a word.\n- ""LARED"": not standard.\n- ""PARED"": as above.\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n\nSo the most common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe also have ""BARRE"" but that has two R\'s and E at 5? No, pattern requires E at 4.\n\nAnother word: ""PARER"" but that has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> but then the last letter is R, which is duplicate. And we haven\'t excluded R? But we know R is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. Also, in ""PARER"", the last letter is R, which is the same as the R at position 3. But we don\'t have any feedback about duplicates. However, we can consider it.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""PARER"", then we have:\n  P at 1: we don\'t know.\n  A at 2: correct.\n  R at 3: correct.\n  E at 4: correct.\n  R at 5: if the word has two R\'s, then it might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So R is allowed? But we already have R in the word, and we are allowing a duplicate? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was marked as present (but wrong position). In the second guess, we have R at position 3 and it\'s correct. So if the word has only one R, then we cannot have R at position 5. But if it has two R\'s, then it might be okay.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates for simplicity? Or we can use it to test.\n\nBut we have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". They both end with D. \n\nWe can also consider ""BARON"" but that doesn\'t have E at position 4? It\'s B A R O N, which doesn\'t have E at position 4.\n\nWe must have E at position 4.\n\nSo the only common words are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""FARCE"" but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": not common.\n\nSo we have two strong candidates.\n\nWe need to choose one. We can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the letters are not excluded. B and D are not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, for ""PARED"": P and D are not excluded.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word. We have to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BARED"" to test B and D.\n\nIf we guess ""BARED"" and it\'s not the word, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D? Or if D is not in the word, then we know the last letter is not D.\n\nBut we have only two positions to guess, so we can test both at once? Not really, because we have to fill the entire word.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" for P and D.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nWe can also consider ""WAVED"": but that has V at 5? And we don\'t have E at 4? No, ""WAVED"" is W A V E D -> E is at 4? Actually: W(1), A(2), V(3)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 3 must be R.\n\nThe pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.\n\nSo the only words that fit are those with A, R, E in the middle and then a letter at the end.\n\nOther words? \n\n- ""BARRE"": B A R R E -> but that has E at position 5? Not at 4. So no.\n- ""PARER"": as above, has E at 4? No, it has E at 4? P(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) -> so it has E at 4? Yes, and R at 5. But we have two R\'s? And we are testing R at 5? But we know R is in the word, and we have it at 3 and 5? That might be possible.\n\nBut ""PARER"" is a word. And it uses P and R (duplicate) at positions 1 and 5.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates? Or we can use it to test.\n\nBut note: we have excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M. So P is allowed, and R is already in the word (so if we use R again, we can check if it\'s duplicated).\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. We can try ""PARER"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get:\n\nIf the secret word is ""PARER"", then:\n  P: ? \n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  R: ✓ (if the last letter is R) -> but we have two R\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the last letter is R.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BARED"" or ""PARED"".\n\nI think it\'s safer to try one of the non-duplicate words first.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""BARED"" and ""PARED"". Both end with D. \n\nWe can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. B and D are not excluded.\n\nSo let\'s guess ""BARED"".\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess. We can try one.\n\nIf we guess ""BARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess, so we have 2 more after this? Total 6, so we have 2 left after this.\n\nWe can also try a word that uses a different letter at the end to test multiple options? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""BARRE"" but it doesn\'t fit the pattern because E must be at 4, not 5.\n\nAnother idea: we can try ""BREAD"" but that has E at 4? B R E A D -> but that would be B(1), R(2)? But we need R at position 3? So no, because position 2 is R? But we need position 3 to be R? So the pattern is fixed: position 2 is A, 3 is R, 4 is E.\n\nSo we cannot change that.\n\nWe must have A at 2, R at 3, E at 4.\n\nSo the only flexibility is the first and last letters.\n\nWe can try ""BARED"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got so far: we have three guesses of ""crane"", ""tares"", ""harem"" which all had A, R, E in the correct positions. So the word must be one of the candidates we listed.\n\nWe can also consider ""PARED"" or ""BARED"".\n\nI think we should try ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious. What if the word is ""PARER""? Then we haven\'t considered duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we try ""BARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know that the first letter is not B, and the last letter is not D. Then we can try ""PARED"" next.\n\nBut we have two more guesses after this, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried at the end to test? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BARED"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BARED"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""BARED"" is a common word.\n\nSo the guess is ""BARED"".\n\nBut note: we are putting B at 1 and D at 5.\n\nIf the word is ""BARED"", then we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and D.\n\nBut we have other options: ""PARED"", ""FARED"" (if accepted), etc.\n\nBut ""FARED"" is not common.\n\nAnother word: ""GARED"" is not common.\n\nSo the main options are ""BARED"" and ""PARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""WAVED"" but it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nOr ""JARED"" is not common.\n\nSo I think ""BARED"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""BARED"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are fixed as A, R, E).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M (excluded from the word).\n- **Known present letters**: A, R, E (with positions locked).\n- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the excluded list (available: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E ?`.\n- Common candidates include:\n  - **BARED**: B at 1, D at 5\n  - **PARED**: P at 1, D at 5\n  - **FARED**: F at 1, D at 5 (less common)\n- ""BARED"" tests **B** and **D**, which are high-frequency letters. ""PARED"" tests **P** and **D**. \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Prioritize **BARED** to test **B** and **D** efficiently. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if B or D is present and in the right position, narrowing to ""PARED"" or other candidates.\n\n### Why ""BARED""?\n- Tests **B** (position 1) and **D** (position 5), both new and common letters.\n- If correct, the word is solved. If not, feedback will reveal:\n  - If **B** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).\n  - If **D** is present (✓ or -) (if absent, excluded).\n- This will pinpoint the solution to ""PARED"" or another candidate (e.g., ""FARED"" if valid).\n\n<guess>bared</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)\nGuess 4: bared -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word, but not at position 2)\n  A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""tares""\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 3: ""harem""\n  H: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  M: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 4: ""bared""\n  B: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  R: ✓ (correct, at position 3)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  D: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nNow, from the feedback of guess 4, we see that D is correct at position 5.

But note D is already at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it would be duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider the possibility.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.\n- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but that would be two D\'s. Is ""dared"" a word? Yes, meaning dared or encouraged. And it has D at 1 and 5.\n\nBut we have D at 5 correct, so if we put D at 1, it might be duplicate?

Not common.\n- ""GARED"": not common.\n- ""LARED"": not common.\n- ""PARED"": P at 1, D at 5 -> ""pared"" means trimmed or dressed. Common word.\n- ""WARED"": not common.\n- ""YARED"": not common.\n\nBut ""PARED"" is a common word.\n\nAlso, ""DARED"" is a word.\n\nBut we have to check if they are valid.\n\nWe also have ""BARED"": but B is excluded, and ""bared"" is not common? Actually, ""bared"" might be a variant of barre, but not standard.\n\nAnother word: ""CARED"": C excluded.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe can also consider ""JARED"": not common.\n\nOr ""KARED"": not common.\n\nSo we have two strong candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe need to choose one.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" first.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that P is not excluded? It is not in the excluded list.\n\nSimilarly, for ""DARED"", D is already known to be at position 5, so if we use D at 1, it\'s duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we can try one.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"".\n\nIf we guess ""PARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know that the first letter is not P, and the word is likely ""DARED"".\n\nBut we have only one guess left after this? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after this? Total 6, so we have two more after this.\n\nBut if we guess ""PARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can guess ""DARED"" next.\n\nBut we can also consider: what if the word is ""FARED""? But ""FARED"" is not common.\n\nOr ""LARED"": not common.\n\nSo the only common words are ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe can also check: ""WARED"" is not common.\n\nSo I think we should try ""PARED"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a 5-letter word: P-A-R-E-D.\n\nPattern: P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\nThis matches the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\nBut in ""DARED"", the first letter is D, which is the same as the last letter? So duplicate D.\n\nWe don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But in the feedback so far, we haven\'t seen a duplicate marked. However, we don\'t have evidence against duplicates.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had no duplicates. In the second and third guesses, no duplicates. In the fourth guess, we had no duplicates.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the word has duplicates? But we don\'t have any indication.\n\nHowever, in the fourth guess, we had ""bared"" which has no duplicates, and D was correct at 5.\n\nSo if the word is ""dared"", then in ""bared"", the D at 5 was correct, but the D at 1 in ""dared"" would have been marked as present? But in ""bared"", we didn\'t have a D at 1? We had B at 1.\n\nIn ""bared"", we had:\n  B: x (absent)\n  A: ✓ (correct)\n  R: ✓ (correct)\n  E: ✓ (correct)\n  D: ✓ (correct)\n\nSo the D at 5 is accounted for, but if the word is ""dared"", then there is another D at 1. But in ""bared"", we didn\'t test a D at 1, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback for ""bared"" doesn\'t show any duplicate marks, so if the word had a duplicate D, we would have seen a \'-\' for the D in ""bared""? Actually, no, because in ""bared"", we only have one D (at position 5). So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we got:\n  B: absent (x)\n  A: correct (✓)\n  R: correct (✓)\n  E: correct (✓)\n  D: correct (✓)\n\nBut in ""dared"", the first letter is D, so when we guessed ""bared"", the D at 5 is correct, and the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn\'t guess a D at 1. So we don\'t get feedback for the D at 1.\n\nSo we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.\n\nTherefore, we have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" to test P.\n\nIf we guess ""PARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know the first letter is not P, and we can try ""DARED"" next.\n\nBut we have two guesses left after this (since we are on the fifth guess, and we have two more after).\n\nSo we can try ""PARED"".\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""PARED"", and the word is ""DARED"", then we get:\n  P: x (absent)\n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  D: ✓ (because it matches the D at 5)\n\nBut we would know that the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D (so the word must be ""DARED"").\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and it\'s wrong, then we know the first letter is not D (because we got D correct at 5, but if the first letter is D, then we would have gotten a duplicate mark? Actually, in ""bared"", when we had D at 5 correct, we don\'t know about the first letter D because we didn\'t guess it there.\n\nIn ""bared"", we didn\'t have a D at position 1. So if the secret word is ""dared"", then when we guessed ""bared"", we should have:\n  B: x\n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  D: ✓  -> because the D at 5 is matched, but the D at 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess? But we didn\'t guess a D at 1, so we don\'t get feedback for it. So we cannot tell from the feedback of ""bared"" that D is also at 1? Actually, we don\'t have any information about the first letter of ""dared"" because we didn\'t guess a D at position 1 in any guess? We guessed ""crane"" (no D), ""tares"" (no D), ""harem"" (no D), ""bared"" (no D at 1). So we have no feedback that D is at position 1? But we didn\'t test it.\n\nSo we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" as the next guess.\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try ""DARED"".\n\nBut we have two guesses left (this is guess 5, and we have two more after if needed).\n\nSo let\'s try ""PARED"".\n\nBut note: we are on the fifth guess. We can also try ""DARED"" now? But we want to use a guess to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests multiple letters? But we only have two positions: first and last. And we have two candidates. We can try one.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PARED"".\n\nBut let me confirm: ""PARED"" is a valid word.\n\nSo the guess is ""PARED"".\n\nBut if the word is ""DARED"", then we get:\n  P: x (absent)\n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  D: ✓  (because it matches the D at 5)\n\nThen we would know the first letter is not P, and the last letter is D. So the word must be ""DARED"".\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DARED"" and the word is ""PARED"", then we get:\n  D: x (absent) at position 1? But wait, in ""PARED"", the first letter is P, so D would be absent? And we would get:\n  D: x (if the word is ""PARED"", then D is at 5, but not at 1) -> so D: x, and P: ? \n  But in ""PARED"", P is at 1, so if we guess ""DARED"", then:\n    D at 1: if the word is ""PARED"", then D is absent? But we know D is present at 5, so if the word has only one D, then D at 1 would be absent. But if the word has two D\'s? Then D at 1 might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nBut note: we have the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. So the word ends with D.\n\nAnd we know the first letter is not B (from ""bared"" feedback: B x).\n\nNow, if we guess ""DARED"", and the word is ""PARED"", then:\n  D at 1: absent (x) because the first letter of ""PARED"" is P, not D.\n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  D: ✓ at 5.\n\nSo we get: D(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\n\nBut then we know the first letter is not D, and we can try ""PARED"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""PARED"" and the word is ""DARED"", we get:\n  P: x (absent) at position 1? \n  A: ✓\n  R: ✓\n  E: ✓\n  D: ✓\n\nSo we know P is absent, and D is at 5. Then we try ""DARED"".\n\nBut we have two guesses left, so we can do this.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not one of these but tests the first position with a letter that is not D? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nWe can try ""PARED"" to test P.\n\nBut we can also try a word that has a different letter at 1 and a letter we haven\'t tried at 5? But we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe cannot change the fixed positions 2,3,4.\n\nSo we must have A, R, E at 2,3,4, and then a letter at 1 and 5.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""PARED"" and ""DARED"".\n\nWe can try ""PARED"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words?\n\nWhat about ""LARED""? Not common.\n\n""FARED"": not common.\n\n""GARED"": not common.\n\nSo only two possibilities.\n\nWe can also consider ""CARED"": but C is excluded.\n\n""JARED"": not common.\n\nSo I think we should try ""PARED"".\n\nTherefore, we guess ""PARED"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. P is not excluded, and D is at 5, which is correct.\n\nSo the guess is ""PARED"".\n\nBut if we are wrong, we have one more guess for ""DARED"" on the sixth guess.\n\nSo let\'s do that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed: A, R, E, D).\n- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B (excluded from the word).\n- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The word must be a valid English word of the form `? A R E D`.\n- Common candidates:\n  - **PARED**: P at position 1, D at position 5.\n  - **DARED**: D at position 1, D at position 5 (duplicate D).\n- ""PARED"" tests **P** at position 1, a new letter. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if P is present (though unlikely at position 1) or absent, leaving ""DARED"" as the only common solution.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 5:\n- Prioritize **PARED** to test **P**. If incorrect, the solution must be ""DARED"" (since it\'s the only other common word fitting the pattern and exclusions).\n\n### Why ""PARED""?\n- Tests **P** (position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present (though unlikely, as we have no evidence of duplicates).\n- If correct, the word is solved. If not, we deduce the word is ""DARED"" and use Guess 6.\n\n<guess>pared</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 3: harem -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) M(x)\nGuess 4: bared -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\nGuess 5: pared -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""pared"" -> P(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)
This tells us that:
- P is not in the word (x).
- A, R, E, D are all in the correct positions (✓). Specifically: 
  - A at position 2 (✓),
  - R at position 3 (✓),
  - E at position 4 (✓),
  - D at position 5 (✓).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: _ A R E D

We know the first letter is not P (and also not C, N, T, S, H, M, B, as per previous feedback).

We also know that the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

So the word is: ? A R E D

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M, B, P.

Available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words are there that end with ""ARED""? 

Common words:
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""LARED"": not a common word (might mean to lard or resemble lard).
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning waned or decreased).
- ""FARED"": not common (archaic for navigated).
- ""GARED"": not common.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not common.
- ""VARED"": not common.

But we have ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

But note: we have D at 5, and we are considering D at 1? So ""DARED"" is a candidate.

But are there other candidates? 

What about ""PARED""? We just tried and P is excluded.

Other words? 

- ""BARED"": not a word? ""Barred"" is a word but ends with D? No, ""barred"" is B,A,R,R,E,D? That's 6 letters. Not 5.

- ""SARED"": not a word, and S is excluded.

- ""TARED"": not a word, T excluded.

- ""HARED"": not a word, H excluded.

- ""MARED"": not a word, M excluded.

- ""CARED"": C excluded.

So the only common word that fits is ""DARED"".

But wait, what about ""FARED""? It's not common, but let's see: ""fared"" is an archaic word. We should consider only common words.

Another word: ""YARED""? Not a word.

""JARED"": not common.

So ""DARED"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""DARED"".

But let me confirm: 
  In ""DARED"": 
    D at 1: we don't know if D is allowed at position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 5. If the word has two D's, then D at 1 is also D? But we don't know.

But the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. If the word is ""dared"", then we would have D at 1 as well? But we didn't guess a D at 1 in any previous guess? So we have no information.

But in the feedback for ""bared"", we only got one D (at 5) marked correct. We didn't test a D at position 1. So it's possible.

Moreover, in ""dared"", the first letter is D, which is the same letter as the last. So when we guessed ""bared"", which has D at 5, that was correct. But the secret word ""dared"" has D at 1 and 5. When we guessed ""bared"", we only provided D at 5, so the feedback for D has only that one D matched. The D at position 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess, so we don't get feedback for it. So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, the word must be ""DARED"".

We can also check if there are other words. 

What about ""PARED""? We tried and P is absent. So no.

""BARED"" is not a word.

""WARED"" is not common.

""FARED"" is not common.

""GARED"" is not common.

""JARED"" is not common.

So ""DARED"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""DARED"".

But note: we are on the sixth guess. We can solve it now.

So the guess is ""DARED"".

But let me write it: D A R E D.

Pattern: D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This matches.

So we output ""dared"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, R, E, D).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B, P (excluded from the word).
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting `_ A R E D` and the exclusions is **DARED**:
  - D at position 1 (tests if D is also in position 1, which is possible since D is already confirmed at position 5).
  - A, R, E, D at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (confirmed correct).
- Other candidates (e.g., ""PARED"", ""FARED"") are invalid due to excluded letters (P and F are not excluded, but ""PARED"" was tested and P is absent, and ""FARED"" is obscure).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **DARED** tests the only remaining unknown letter (D at position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present. Since D is already confirmed at position 5, this guess will reveal if D appears twice.

### Why ""DARED""?
- If correct, the word is solved.
- If incorrect, feedback will show if D is present at position 1 (and whether duplicates are allowed).

<guess>dared</guess>",dared,"We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""pared"" -> P(x) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓)
This tells us that:
- P is not in the word (x).
- A, R, E, D are all in the correct positions (✓). Specifically: 
  - A at position 2 (✓),
  - R at position 3 (✓),
  - E at position 4 (✓),
  - D at position 5 (✓).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: _ A R E D

We know the first letter is not P (and also not C, N, T, S, H, M, B, as per previous feedback).

We also know that the word has A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

So the word is: ? A R E D

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter not excluded and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates).

Excluded letters: C, N, T, S, H, M, B, P.

Available letters: F, G, I, J, K, L, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words are there that end with ""ARED""? 

Common words:
- ""CARED"": but C is excluded.
- ""LARED"": not a common word (might mean to lard or resemble lard).
- ""WARED"": not common (meaning waned or decreased).
- ""FARED"": not common (archaic for navigated).
- ""GARED"": not common.
- ""JARED"": not common.
- ""KARED"": not common.
- ""VARED"": not common.

But we have ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5. This is a common word.

But note: we have D at 5, and we are considering D at 1? So ""DARED"" is a candidate.

But are there other candidates? 

What about ""PARED""? We just tried and P is excluded.

Other words? 

- ""BARED"": not a word? ""Barred"" is a word but ends with D? No, ""barred"" is B,A,R,R,E,D? That's 6 letters. Not 5.

- ""SARED"": not a word, and S is excluded.

- ""TARED"": not a word, T excluded.

- ""HARED"": not a word, H excluded.

- ""MARED"": not a word, M excluded.

- ""CARED"": C excluded.

So the only common word that fits is ""DARED"".

But wait, what about ""FARED""? It's not common, but let's see: ""fared"" is an archaic word. We should consider only common words.

Another word: ""YARED""? Not a word.

""JARED"": not common.

So ""DARED"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""DARED"".

But let me confirm: 
  In ""DARED"": 
    D at 1: we don't know if D is allowed at position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 5. If the word has two D's, then D at 1 is also D? But we don't know.

But the feedback from guess 4: ""bared"" had D at 5 correct. If the word is ""dared"", then we would have D at 1 as well? But we didn't guess a D at 1 in any previous guess? So we have no information.

But in the feedback for ""bared"", we only got one D (at 5) marked correct. We didn't test a D at position 1. So it's possible.

Moreover, in ""dared"", the first letter is D, which is the same letter as the last. So when we guessed ""bared"", which has D at 5, that was correct. But the secret word ""dared"" has D at 1 and 5. When we guessed ""bared"", we only provided D at 5, so the feedback for D has only that one D matched. The D at position 1 in the secret word is not covered by the guess, so we don't get feedback for it. So we cannot rule out that the first letter is D.

Therefore, the word must be ""DARED"".

We can also check if there are other words. 

What about ""PARED""? We tried and P is absent. So no.

""BARED"" is not a word.

""WARED"" is not common.

""FARED"" is not common.

""GARED"" is not common.

""JARED"" is not common.

So ""DARED"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""DARED"".

But note: we are on the sixth guess. We can solve it now.

So the guess is ""DARED"".

But let me write it: D A R E D.

Pattern: D at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This matches.

So we output ""dared"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is `_ A R E D` (positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, R, E, D).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, T, S, H, M, B, P (excluded from the word).
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains, which must be a letter not in the excluded list and not A, R, E, D (assuming no duplicates, as no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting `_ A R E D` and the exclusions is **DARED**:
  - D at position 1 (tests if D is also in position 1, which is possible since D is already confirmed at position 5).
  - A, R, E, D at positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (confirmed correct).
- Other candidates (e.g., ""PARED"", ""FARED"") are invalid due to excluded letters (P and F are not excluded, but ""PARED"" was tested and P is absent, and ""FARED"" is obscure).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- **DARED** tests the only remaining unknown letter (D at position 1) and confirms if duplicates are present. Since D is already confirmed at position 5, this guess will reveal if D appears twice.

### Why ""DARED""?
- If correct, the word is solved.
- If incorrect, feedback will show if D is present at position 1 (and whether duplicates are allowed).",Guess 6: dared -> FEEDBACK: D(-) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL
