We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and N as the 4th letter. So the word pattern is _ _ A N _
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th position because those are fixed as A and N. So E must be in the 1st or 2nd position.
- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word and uses the information we have.

Constraints for the new word:
- Must have A as the 3rd letter and N as the 4th letter: so pattern: _ _ A N _
- Must include the letter E (but not in the 5th position, and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd position) but note: E could also be in the 5th? No, because in the first guess E was in the 5th and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th. So E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Must not use C or R.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and include E in position 1 or 2:

Let's consider:
- If E is in the 1st position: E _ A N _ 
  - Examples: EATEN, EAGLE, EAGIN (but not a word?), EAKIN (not common?), EANES (not common?), 
  - Actually, common words: EATEN, EANED (not 5 letters?), 
  - EATEN is a word: E A T E N -> but wait, our pattern requires 3rd to be A and 4th to be N, so EATEN would be E (1st) A (2nd) T (3rd) E (4th) N (5th) -> but that doesn't match because the 3rd should be A and 4th N. So EATEN is E _ A N _ -> positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:A, 4:N, 5:?

Actually, in EATEN:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: A -> but we need position 3 to be A? No, in our pattern the 3rd is A and 4th is N. But in EATEN, the 3rd letter is T and 4th is E and 5th is N. So that doesn't match.

We need the word to have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]

And E must be in position 1 or 2.

So:
- If E is first: E _ A N _
- If E is second: _ E A N _

Now, let's think of words that fit:

For E _ A N _:
- Possible: 
  - ELAND (a word? meaning a type of antelope) -> E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D -> matches pattern? 
    But we don't know if L or D are in the word. Also, we haven't tested L or D.
  - Other words: EANES (not common), EATEN doesn't fit because that has A in position 2 and T in 3.

Actually, ELAND is a valid word. But let's check if it uses any forbidden letters: no C or R, so okay.

But we also have the E that is already known to be in the word. However, in ELAND, we are putting E in the 1st position and L in 2nd, then A in 3rd, N in 4th, and D in 5th.

But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once? The feedback only told us that E is present (at least one E). So it could appear again? But in this guess, we are only required to have one E? Actually, the word must have at least one E, but it might have more.

But in our pattern, we are only requiring one E because we are placing it in 1st or 2nd.

Alternatively, if E is in the 2nd position: _ E A N _
- Words: 
  - DEAN (but that's 4 letters) -> need 5 letters.
  - LEANT -> L E A N T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> matches pattern? 
    But we don't know if L or T are in the word. Also, note that in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced, so E is not in the 5th. But in LEANT, the 5th is T, which is okay.

But we must avoid using C and R.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let me list some candidate words:

For E in 1st position: E _ A N _
- ELAND (valid) -> letters: E, L, A, N, D -> we know A and N are fixed, so we are testing L and D, and E is already known.
- But note: we are allowed to reuse known letters? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we are not forced to include E, but if we don't, we might miss information. Since we know E is present, it would be wise to include it to figure out its position.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in the 2nd position.

But we also have the constraint that the 5th letter is unknown.

We also know that the word does not contain C or R.

Let me think of common words:

For E in 1st: 
- ELANS (5 letters? ELANS is 5 letters: E L A N S -> but S is new) -> but is ELANS a word? It might be less common. 
- Other words: 
  - EAGLE -> but E A G L E -> pattern: E (1st) A (2nd) G (3rd) L (4th) E (5th) -> but we need the 3rd to be A and 4th N? So no.

Wait, we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th. So:

E _ A N _ -> the second letter can be any letter except C and R, and we haven't ruled out others.

Possible words: 
- ELAND (as above) -> E L A N D
- EVADE -> E V A D E -> but then the 4th letter is D, not N -> doesn't match.
- EXAM -> only 4 letters.

Actually, let's think: 
- Words ending with N: but we have A in the 3rd and N in the 4th, so the last letter is the 5th. So pattern: ...A N ? 

So for E _ A N _:
- ELANS? (not common) 
- EANES (not common)
- EATEN -> but E A T E N: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:N -> doesn't match because we need 3rd: A, 4th: N -> here 3rd is T and 4th is E -> no.

Wait, we must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N. So the word must be: [1] [2] A N [5]

So for E in the 1st: E [2] A N [5]

Examples:
- ELAND: E L A N D -> valid word? Yes, meaning a type of antelope.
- Other words: 
  - EYING? -> no A in the 3rd.
  - EDGAN? -> not a word.

Actually, ELAND is a valid word.

But what about E in the 2nd position: _ E A N _

Examples:
- LEANT: L E A N T -> valid word, meaning to lean or slope.
- MEANS: M E A N S -> valid word.
- WEANS? not common.
- HEANS? not common.

Also, DEAN is 4 letters. 

So possible words: ELAND, LEANT, MEANS.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. Now, in these words:
- ELAND: E is in 1st, so the E in the first guess (which was in 5th) was a different E? But we don't know if there are multiple E's. The feedback only said E is present, but it might be only one.

We also have to consider that the 5th letter is unknown.

We want to maximize information. We can try to use a word that has new letters and tests the E position.

But note: we are not required to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word, so including it can help us locate it.

However, we are allowed to guess without E? But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in the 2nd position to test that possibility.

But we have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.

We can design a guess that covers both? Or we can choose one.

Let me list words that fit the pattern and include E in 1st or 2nd and avoid C and R.

Pattern: _ _ A N _

With E in 1st: 
- ELAND (E L A N D) -> tests L and D.
- EVADE -> doesn't have N in 4th.
- EXAM -> too short.

Actually, I can't think of many 5-letter words with pattern E _ A N _ and avoiding C and R.

E _ A N _ -> the second letter can be any letter except C and R. Let's call it X: so E X A N Y.

Words: 
- ELANS? (not common) 
- EYANS? not a word.
- EDANS? not a word.

Common words: 
- MEANS: M E A N S -> but note: in MEANS, the E is in the 2nd position? 
  MEANS: M (1st) E (2nd) A (3rd) N (4th) S (5th) -> matches the pattern? 
  But we have A in 3rd and N in 4th: yes. And E is in 2nd. 

But wait, in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. Now, if we put E in the 2nd, that might be the correct position.

Similarly, for E in 1st: ELAND.

But MEANS is a common word.

Now, for E in 2nd: 
- LEANT: L E A N T -> L(1st) E(2nd) A(3rd) N(4th) T(5th)
- MEANS: M E A N S -> M(1st) E(2nd) A(3rd) N(4th) S(5th)

Both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has E but not in the 5th. So if we put E in the 2nd, that might be the correct position.

We can choose either.

But we also want to test other common letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We can try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Let me consider:

Option 1: ELAND -> tests E (in 1st), L, D. But note: if the secret word has E in the 2nd, then ELAND would have E in the 1st which might be wrong. So we might get feedback that E is not in the 1st? Then we know E must be in the 2nd.

Option 2: MEANS -> tests E in the 2nd, and M and S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is present, so that might not be efficient.

Another idea: we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have two unknowns: the first letter and the fifth letter.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think MEANS is a good candidate because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position (if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then E must be in the 1st).
- It tests M and S, which are common.

Alternatively, LEANT tests L and T.

But MEANS has the advantage of having S at the end, which is common.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. So if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's not correct, then we know E must be in the 1st. So we can narrow down.

But we also want to cover the possibility of E in the 1st.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st and then other new letters.

But ELAND is less common. MEANS is more common.

Another word: DEANO? not a word.

Or PAINT? but that doesn't have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Wait, let me list words that fit the pattern:

- With E in 1st: 
  - ELAND (valid) -> E L A N D
  - ECHOS -> but no N in 4th.
  - EDANA? not a word.

Actually, ELAND is the only common word I can think of for E in 1st.

With E in 2nd:
- LEANT (valid) -> L E A N T
- MEANS (valid) -> M E A N S
- HEANS? not common -> HEANX? no.
- WEANS? not common.
- DEANS? not common.

Also, TEANS? not common.

So common words: LEANT, MEANS.

We can also consider: 
- BEANS? -> B E A N S -> but then the 3rd letter is A? Yes, and 4th is N? Yes. Pattern: B E A N S -> but note: the 3rd is A and 4th is N? 
  Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: S -> matches. And E is in 2nd. 
  But we don't know if B is in the word? 

But BEANS has B and S, which are new.

But note: we have two possibilities for E: 1st or 2nd. So we can try to cover both by choosing a word that has E in the 2nd? Then if we get a ✓ for E, we know it's in the 2nd. If we get a '-' then E is in the word but not in 2nd, so it must be in 1st. And if we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

But also, we are testing other letters.

I think MEANS is a good choice because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position.
- It tests M and S, which are common.
- And it avoids C and R.

Alternatively, LEANT tests L and T.

But MEANS has the advantage of having S at the end, which is a common ending letter.

We can also consider: 
- What about using a word that doesn't have E? But that might be inefficient because we know E is present and we need to find its position.

So I'll go with MEANS.

But wait: in MEANS, the E is in the 2nd position. If the secret word has E in the 1st, then in MEANS, the E in the 2nd would get a '-' (because the E is present but in the wrong position) and then we would know E is in the 1st? 

But note: MEANS has only one E? We don't know if it has more. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? Actually, the first guess had one E and it was marked as present but misplaced. So if the word has two E's, we don't know. But we can handle that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st to test that.

But let's choose MEANS because it's a common word and tests two new common letters (M and S).

So my second guess: MEANS

But note: we must avoid using C and R. MEANS does not contain C or R.

So let's go with MEANS.

<guess>means</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked with ""-""), so it must be in the 1st or 2nd position.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A N _

For the second guess:
- Must include E in either the 1st or 2nd position to test its location.
- Avoid using C and R.
- Use new common letters to gather more information.

""MEANS"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position (if correct, we get a ""✓""; if not, E must be in the 1st position).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and S) for additional feedback.
- It fits the pattern _ _ A N _ and avoids C and R.

<guess>means</guess>",means,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A as the 3rd letter and N as the 4th letter. So the word pattern is _ _ A N _
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th position because those are fixed as A and N. So E must be in the 1st or 2nd position.
- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter English word and uses the information we have.

Constraints for the new word:
- Must have A as the 3rd letter and N as the 4th letter: so pattern: _ _ A N _
- Must include the letter E (but not in the 5th position, and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd position) but note: E could also be in the 5th? No, because in the first guess E was in the 5th and got a '-', meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th. So E must be in position 1 or 2.
- Must not use C or R.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and include E in position 1 or 2:

Let's consider:
- If E is in the 1st position: E _ A N _ 
  - Examples: EATEN, EAGLE, EAGIN (but not a word?), EAKIN (not common?), EANES (not common?), 
  - Actually, common words: EATEN, EANED (not 5 letters?), 
  - EATEN is a word: E A T E N -> but wait, our pattern requires 3rd to be A and 4th to be N, so EATEN would be E (1st) A (2nd) T (3rd) E (4th) N (5th) -> but that doesn't match because the 3rd should be A and 4th N. So EATEN is E _ A N _ -> positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:A, 4:N, 5:?

Actually, in EATEN:
- Position 1: E
- Position 2: A -> but we need position 3 to be A? No, in our pattern the 3rd is A and 4th is N. But in EATEN, the 3rd letter is T and 4th is E and 5th is N. So that doesn't match.

We need the word to have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N. So the pattern is: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]

And E must be in position 1 or 2.

So:
- If E is first: E _ A N _
- If E is second: _ E A N _

Now, let's think of words that fit:

For E _ A N _:
- Possible: 
  - ELAND (a word? meaning a type of antelope) -> E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D -> matches pattern? 
    But we don't know if L or D are in the word. Also, we haven't tested L or D.
  - Other words: EANES (not common), EATEN doesn't fit because that has A in position 2 and T in 3.

Actually, ELAND is a valid word. But let's check if it uses any forbidden letters: no C or R, so okay.

But we also have the E that is already known to be in the word. However, in ELAND, we are putting E in the 1st position and L in 2nd, then A in 3rd, N in 4th, and D in 5th.

But note: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears more than once? The feedback only told us that E is present (at least one E). So it could appear again? But in this guess, we are only required to have one E? Actually, the word must have at least one E, but it might have more.

But in our pattern, we are only requiring one E because we are placing it in 1st or 2nd.

Alternatively, if E is in the 2nd position: _ E A N _
- Words: 
  - DEAN (but that's 4 letters) -> need 5 letters.
  - LEANT -> L E A N T -> positions: 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T -> matches pattern? 
    But we don't know if L or T are in the word. Also, note that in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced, so E is not in the 5th. But in LEANT, the 5th is T, which is okay.

But we must avoid using C and R.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let me list some candidate words:

For E in 1st position: E _ A N _
- ELAND (valid) -> letters: E, L, A, N, D -> we know A and N are fixed, so we are testing L and D, and E is already known.
- But note: we are allowed to reuse known letters? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we are not forced to include E, but if we don't, we might miss information. Since we know E is present, it would be wise to include it to figure out its position.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in the 2nd position.

But we also have the constraint that the 5th letter is unknown.

We also know that the word does not contain C or R.

Let me think of common words:

For E in 1st: 
- ELANS (5 letters? ELANS is 5 letters: E L A N S -> but S is new) -> but is ELANS a word? It might be less common. 
- Other words: 
  - EAGLE -> but E A G L E -> pattern: E (1st) A (2nd) G (3rd) L (4th) E (5th) -> but we need the 3rd to be A and 4th N? So no.

Wait, we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th. So:

E _ A N _ -> the second letter can be any letter except C and R, and we haven't ruled out others.

Possible words: 
- ELAND (as above) -> E L A N D
- EVADE -> E V A D E -> but then the 4th letter is D, not N -> doesn't match.
- EXAM -> only 4 letters.

Actually, let's think: 
- Words ending with N: but we have A in the 3rd and N in the 4th, so the last letter is the 5th. So pattern: ...A N ? 

So for E _ A N _:
- ELANS? (not common) 
- EANES (not common)
- EATEN -> but E A T E N: positions: 1:E, 2:A, 3:T, 4:E, 5:N -> doesn't match because we need 3rd: A, 4th: N -> here 3rd is T and 4th is E -> no.

Wait, we must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N. So the word must be: [1] [2] A N [5]

So for E in the 1st: E [2] A N [5]

Examples:
- ELAND: E L A N D -> valid word? Yes, meaning a type of antelope.
- Other words: 
  - EYING? -> no A in the 3rd.
  - EDGAN? -> not a word.

Actually, ELAND is a valid word.

But what about E in the 2nd position: _ E A N _

Examples:
- LEANT: L E A N T -> valid word, meaning to lean or slope.
- MEANS: M E A N S -> valid word.
- WEANS? not common.
- HEANS? not common.

Also, DEAN is 4 letters. 

So possible words: ELAND, LEANT, MEANS.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. Now, in these words:
- ELAND: E is in 1st, so the E in the first guess (which was in 5th) was a different E? But we don't know if there are multiple E's. The feedback only said E is present, but it might be only one.

We also have to consider that the 5th letter is unknown.

We want to maximize information. We can try to use a word that has new letters and tests the E position.

But note: we are not required to include E? Actually, we know E is in the word, so including it can help us locate it.

However, we are allowed to guess without E? But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has E in the 2nd position to test that possibility.

But we have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.

We can design a guess that covers both? Or we can choose one.

Let me list words that fit the pattern and include E in 1st or 2nd and avoid C and R.

Pattern: _ _ A N _

With E in 1st: 
- ELAND (E L A N D) -> tests L and D.
- EVADE -> doesn't have N in 4th.
- EXAM -> too short.

Actually, I can't think of many 5-letter words with pattern E _ A N _ and avoiding C and R.

E _ A N _ -> the second letter can be any letter except C and R. Let's call it X: so E X A N Y.

Words: 
- ELANS? (not common) 
- EYANS? not a word.
- EDANS? not a word.

Common words: 
- MEANS: M E A N S -> but note: in MEANS, the E is in the 2nd position? 
  MEANS: M (1st) E (2nd) A (3rd) N (4th) S (5th) -> matches the pattern? 
  But we have A in 3rd and N in 4th: yes. And E is in 2nd. 

But wait, in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. Now, if we put E in the 2nd, that might be the correct position.

Similarly, for E in 1st: ELAND.

But MEANS is a common word.

Now, for E in 2nd: 
- LEANT: L E A N T -> L(1st) E(2nd) A(3rd) N(4th) T(5th)
- MEANS: M E A N S -> M(1st) E(2nd) A(3rd) N(4th) S(5th)

Both are valid.

But note: in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. That means the secret word has E but not in the 5th. So if we put E in the 2nd, that might be the correct position.

We can choose either.

But we also want to test other common letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We can try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Let me consider:

Option 1: ELAND -> tests E (in 1st), L, D. But note: if the secret word has E in the 2nd, then ELAND would have E in the 1st which might be wrong. So we might get feedback that E is not in the 1st? Then we know E must be in the 2nd.

Option 2: MEANS -> tests E in the 2nd, and M and S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is present, so that might not be efficient.

Another idea: we can try a word that has E in the 2nd position and also tests other common letters.

But note: we have two unknowns: the first letter and the fifth letter.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

I think MEANS is a good candidate because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position (if it's correct, we get a check; if not, then E must be in the 1st).
- It tests M and S, which are common.

Alternatively, LEANT tests L and T.

But MEANS has the advantage of having S at the end, which is common.

However, note that in the first guess, we had E in the 5th and it was misplaced. So if we put E in the 2nd, and if it's not correct, then we know E must be in the 1st. So we can narrow down.

But we also want to cover the possibility of E in the 1st.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st and then other new letters.

But ELAND is less common. MEANS is more common.

Another word: DEANO? not a word.

Or PAINT? but that doesn't have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Wait, let me list words that fit the pattern:

- With E in 1st: 
  - ELAND (valid) -> E L A N D
  - ECHOS -> but no N in 4th.
  - EDANA? not a word.

Actually, ELAND is the only common word I can think of for E in 1st.

With E in 2nd:
- LEANT (valid) -> L E A N T
- MEANS (valid) -> M E A N S
- HEANS? not common -> HEANX? no.
- WEANS? not common.
- DEANS? not common.

Also, TEANS? not common.

So common words: LEANT, MEANS.

We can also consider: 
- BEANS? -> B E A N S -> but then the 3rd letter is A? Yes, and 4th is N? Yes. Pattern: B E A N S -> but note: the 3rd is A and 4th is N? 
  Position 1: B, 2: E, 3: A, 4: N, 5: S -> matches. And E is in 2nd. 
  But we don't know if B is in the word? 

But BEANS has B and S, which are new.

But note: we have two possibilities for E: 1st or 2nd. So we can try to cover both by choosing a word that has E in the 2nd? Then if we get a ✓ for E, we know it's in the 2nd. If we get a '-' then E is in the word but not in 2nd, so it must be in 1st. And if we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we expect either ✓ or '-'.

But also, we are testing other letters.

I think MEANS is a good choice because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position.
- It tests M and S, which are common.
- And it avoids C and R.

Alternatively, LEANT tests L and T.

But MEANS has the advantage of having S at the end, which is a common ending letter.

We can also consider: 
- What about using a word that doesn't have E? But that might be inefficient because we know E is present and we need to find its position.

So I'll go with MEANS.

But wait: in MEANS, the E is in the 2nd position. If the secret word has E in the 1st, then in MEANS, the E in the 2nd would get a '-' (because the E is present but in the wrong position) and then we would know E is in the 1st? 

But note: MEANS has only one E? We don't know if it has more. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one E? Actually, the first guess had one E and it was marked as present but misplaced. So if the word has two E's, we don't know. But we can handle that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st to test that.

But let's choose MEANS because it's a common word and tests two new common letters (M and S).

So my second guess: MEANS

But note: we must avoid using C and R. MEANS does not contain C or R.

So let's go with MEANS.

<guess>means</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").
- N is in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked with ""-""), so it must be in the 1st or 2nd position.

The secret word pattern is: _ _ A N _

For the second guess:
- Must include E in either the 1st or 2nd position to test its location.
- Avoid using C and R.
- Use new common letters to gather more information.

""MEANS"" is a strong choice because:
- It tests E in the 2nd position (if correct, we get a ""✓""; if not, E must be in the 1st position).
- It introduces two new common letters (M and S) for additional feedback.
- It fits the pattern _ _ A N _ and avoids C and R.",Guess 2: means -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
