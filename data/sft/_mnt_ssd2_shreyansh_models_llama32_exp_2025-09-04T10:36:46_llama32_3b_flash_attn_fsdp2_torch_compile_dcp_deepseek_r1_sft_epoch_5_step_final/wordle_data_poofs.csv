We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Some good starting letters (besides the ones we already tried and failed) might include: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""sight"" -> uses S, I, G, H, T -> none of the forbidden letters.
   ""could"" -> but has C and we know C is out -> not allowed.
   ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> not allowed.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of a word: 
   ""slimy"" -> S, L, I, M, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
        S: allowed, L: allowed, I: allowed, M: allowed, Y: allowed.

 But is ""slimy"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ghost"" -> G, H, O, S, T -> no forbidden letters? 
        G, H, O, S, T are all allowed.

 ""ghost"" is a common word and might be a good choice.

 Another option: ""built"" -> but we need 5 letters, so ""build"" -> but has U, I, L, D -> but D is allowed? 
        But ""build"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""build"" is 5 letters: B,U,I,L,D.

 However, we have to avoid E and we are not using any forbidden. But let's check: 
        B: allowed, U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, D: allowed.

 But we might want to cover more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U.

 We haven't tested O or U yet. So maybe a word with O and U would be good.

 Example: ""pouty"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> all allowed.

 However, I think ""ghost"" is a solid choice because it has common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O).

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> all allowed.

 But note: we have already tried S and T? Actually, we haven't tried them in the context of the secret word, but we know that in the first guess, S, T, O, M, P were not tried because we used ""crane"". Wait, no: the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so the secret word does not contain any of C, R, A, N, E. But we haven't tested S, T, O, M, P, etc.

 So, let's choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 I think ""ghost"" is a good candidate.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""shtik"" but that is not very common. 

 Alternatively, ""moult"" -> M, O, U, L, T -> all allowed.

 But I think ""ghost"" is more common.

 Let me go with ""ghost"".

 So, the next guess is ""ghost"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

For the second guess, I selected ""ghost"" because:
- It uses common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O) not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It provides broad coverage of new letters to gather more information.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""ghost"" -> 
   G: absent (x)
   H: absent (x)
   O: correct (✓) and in the right position? The feedback says O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the third letter in ""ghost"", that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
   S: present but wrong position (-)
   T: absent (x)

So, from ""ghost"":
- The third letter is O (position 3).
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- G, H, T are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the third position: _ _ O _ _
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position. Since the fourth position in ""ghost"" is S, but it's marked as wrong position, S must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's clarify:

In ""ghost"":
Position 1: G
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (correct)
Position 4: S (wrong position)
Position 5: T

So S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

And we have confirmed that O is in position 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in the third position.
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position (and not in the third because that's O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Available letters: We can use any letters except the forbidden ones: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

But we must include S and O (O is fixed at position 3).

Structure: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1, 2, or 5.

We also need to choose a word that tests other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the third position.
- Must include S (but not at position 4).
- Must not use C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Possible letters for the other positions: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that match the pattern _ _ O _ _ and contain S.

Options:
- If S is at position 1: S _ O _ _
  - Examples: ""scowp"" (not a word), ""scoop"" (but has O again? and we don't know if O is duplicated, but we only have one O so far). Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we can avoid for now to be safe.
  - ""sowce"" -> invalid.
  - ""sowls"" -> valid? S O W L S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""solo"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words: 
- ""sowce"" is not valid.
- ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W, not O. We need O at position 3.

So for S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a letter for position 2, then two more letters. And the word must have S at the end? Not necessarily, because S is already used at position 1, and we don't know if S appears twice, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one S, but if the word had two S's, we might have seen two marks? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one S in ""ghost"", and it was marked as present, but if the word has two S's, we wouldn't know. However, we can only use one S in our guess? Actually, we can use more, but we know at least one S is present.

But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

So, for S at position 1: S ? O ? ?
We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5.

Possible words: 
- ""solo"" -> too short.
- ""scold"" -> but has C and L? C is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""sold"" -> too short.
- ""solves"" -> S O L V E -> but E is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""solves"" has E -> invalid.

Another: ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""sophs"" -> S O P H S -> but H is forbidden -> invalid.

This is tricky.

Perhaps S at position 2: _ S O _ _
Then the word has S in the second position.

Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> but E and T are forbidden -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern is _ S O _ _ -> so position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, then two more.

Words: 
- ""islet"" is invalid because of E and T.
- ""psalm"" -> P S A L M -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""dossy"" -> D O S S Y -> but position 3 is S -> not O. We need O at position 3.

So: _ S O _ _ 
Possible: 
- ""usnea"" -> not a common word.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Now, S at position 5: _ _ O _ S
Then the word ends with S.

Examples:
- ""prows"" -> P R O W S -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""crowns"" -> 6 letters.
- ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern: _ _ O _ S -> so position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, then position 4: ?, position 5: S.

Words:
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S? And position 5 is S. But we have S at position 5, and also at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4 from the feedback? Wait, no: the feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4. But it can be at other positions. In ""floss"", if we put S at position 4 and 5, but we know S is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for ""ghost"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, S cannot be at position 4. So if we try a word with S at position 4, it would be incorrect. But in ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. However, we know S is not at position 4, so ""floss"" would have S at position 4 which is invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. It doesn't prevent us from guessing a word with S at position 4? But we know it's not correct, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting S at position 4.

But in our guess, we can put S anywhere, but we know that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Actually, no: if we put S at position 4, and the secret word has S but not at position 4, then the feedback will show S as present but wrong position? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting S at position 4 to conserve a slot.

So for the pattern _ _ O _ S:
We need a word with O at 3 and S at 5, and without the forbidden letters.

Example: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> but position 3 is U? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have O at position 3 and S at position 5.

Words:
- ""boughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""doughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S, which we know is not allowed? Actually, we are considering the secret word, not our guess. In the secret word, S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. But we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so the S at position 4 in our guess would be marked as absent? Because the secret word doesn't have S at position 4. But we also have S at position 5, which might be correct or not.

But we are looking for a word that fits the pattern. However, we are struggling to find a word.

Another idea: perhaps S is not at position 5? Let's list possible words.

We know the word has O at position 3 and S somewhere (not position 4). Also, the word must have exactly the letters we know? No, we don't know, there might be more letters.

We also have to consider that we have only one S so far? The feedback for ""ghost"" had only one S and it was marked as present, so likely there is only one S.

But let's think of common words.

Perhaps S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a word: S ? O ? ?

Possible: 
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 2 is O? We have O at position 3, so position 2 cannot be O? Actually, we don't know if there is another O. The feedback for ""ghost"" had O at position 3 correct, but that doesn't say anything about other O's. However, we haven't tested other O's.

But in ""sowls"", we have O at position 2 and 3? That might be acceptable, but we are avoiding forbidden letters. Also, ""sowls"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's avoid rare words.

Another: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No, we need O at position 3.

So: S ? O ? ? 

Possible: 
- ""scoot"" -> has C -> invalid.
- ""sproof"" -> too long.
- ""stool"" -> has T -> invalid.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another common word: ""mossy"" -> M O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me search for words with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""found"" -> F O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""mound"" -> M O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""round"" -> R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""sound"" -> S O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""wound"" -> W O U N D -> has N -> invalid.

All these have forbidden letters.

What about ""boughs""? 6 letters.

""crowns"" -> 6 letters.

""doughs"" -> 6 letters.

""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

""blossoms"" -> 6 letters.

This is problematic.

Perhaps ""floss"" but that has S at position 4 and 5, and we know S is not at position 4, so we cannot use that.

But wait, we can use ""floss"" as a guess? But we know S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, it would be correct? But we don't know. We only know S is in the word and not at position 4.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can guess a word that has S in a different position and tests new letters.

We know the third letter is O, and S is present (but not at position 4). So S must be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we are struggling to find a word that fits.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""sowce"" but that's invalid.

Or ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have the third letter O.

Let me think of words ending with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pooch"" -> P O O C H -> has C and H -> invalid.
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O? Yes: P(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), S(5). But we have O at position 2 and 3? That's possible. And the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in our guess, we can use ""pools"". But let's check the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

Forbidden letters: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T. P, O, L, S are allowed? O is already known, and we are using it again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's.

But we can try.

However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""pools"" has P, O, L, S -> no forbidden letters? P, O, L, S are not in the forbidden list. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So P, O, L, S are allowed.

But position 3 is O, which is correct. And we are putting S at position 5.

But we also have O at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if there is a second O.

But the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one O (at position 3) and the rest were absent. But if the secret word has two O's, then when we guessed ""ghost"" (which had one O at position 3) and the secret word has an O at position 2, then we wouldn't have known.

So ""pools"" is a candidate? But we are guessing, not the secret.

We can use ""pools"" as a guess.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""browl"" -> B R O W L -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""droll"" -> D R O L L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""fjord"" -> F J O R D -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6 letters.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me list 5-letter words with O as the third letter.

Pattern: ??O??

But we also have to include S.

So the word must have O at position 3 and S in position 1,2, or 5 (but not 4).

So:
- Position 1: S -> then word: S ? O ? ?
- Position 2: S -> then word: ? S O ? ?
- Position 5: S -> then word: ? ? O ? S

And the word must not contain forbidden letters.

Let me try to find words for each case.

Case 1: S at position 1 -> S ? O ? ?
We need a letter for position 2, and then two more. And the word must not have forbidden letters.

Possible: 
- ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No.
- ""slyly"" -> S Y L Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So: S ? O ? ?

Examples:
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think I'm missing something.

Another: ""soggy"" -> S O G G Y -> but G is forbidden -> invalid.

""sooty"" -> S O O T Y -> has T -> invalid.

""soppy"" -> S O P P Y -> position 3 is P -> not O.

This is not working.

Case 2: S at position 2 -> ? S O ? ?
Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> has E and T -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""usnea"" -> not common.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

Case 3: S at position 5 -> ? ? O ? S
Examples:
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O (good), position 5 is S (good). But we have O at position 2 as well. And letters: P, O, O, L, S -> forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. P, O, L, S are allowed. But we have two O's? That's acceptable.

Is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

But we are not sure if the secret word has two O's.

Another word: ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""floss"" -> F L O S S -> position 3 is O (good), position 4 is S (bad, because we know S is not at position 4). So we cannot use ""floss"" because it has S at position 4, which we know is wrong.

But we can use a word that has S at position 5 and O at position 3.

Other words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> has S at position 4 -> invalid for our purpose.

""pools"" seems a candidate.

Another: ""prowl"" -> P R O W L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""troll"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

""vowel"" -> V O V E L -> has E -> invalid.

""wolves"" -> W O L V E S -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

So ""pools"" is a possibility.

But let's check if there are other words.

Another: ""mowls"" -> M O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""dowly"" -> D O W L Y -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""bowls"" -> B O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" is one.

""brooks"" -> 6 letters.

""brooks"" is 6.

""brook"" -> 5 letters? B R O O K -> has R -> invalid.

""crook"" -> C and R -> invalid.

""froze"" -> F R O Z E -> has R and E -> invalid.

""globe"" -> G forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M -> not O.

""kopos"" -> K O P O S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""losos"" -> L O S O S -> position 3 is S -> not O.

""moses"" -> M O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""noses"" -> N and E -> invalid.

""posse"" -> P O S S E -> has E -> invalid.

""roses"" -> R and E -> invalid.

""soses"" -> S O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""tosses"" -> T and E -> invalid.

""voss"" -> too short.

""woss"" -> too short.

""yoss"" -> too short.

""yowza"" -> not a word.

So ""pools"" might be a good guess.

But ""pools"" has two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's. But that's okay, we can guess it.

Another word: ""dowle"" -> not a word.

""howfs"" -> not common.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> K O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other letters.

We know the secret word has S and O (at position 3). And we are going to guess ""pools"".

But let's see the pattern: P O O L S

We are testing:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O (we don't know if O is duplicated)
- Position 3: O (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for O at position 3? But we will get feedback per letter.)

But we are also testing L and the S at position 5.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then we might get feedback on that.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, O, O, L, S -> none of C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So it's okay.

But is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""dowly"" -> not a word.

""fjord"" -> has R -> invalid.

""jordy"" -> J O R D Y -> has R -> invalid.

""kiosks"" -> 6 letters.

""losars"" -> 6 letters.

""mosaics"" -> 6 letters.

So ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sulky"" -> S U L K Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sumac"" -> has C -> invalid.

""sumpt"" -> not a word.

""sunk"" -> too short.

""sulks"" -> not O at position 3.

I think ""pools"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with S at position 1.

For example, ""sowls"" is not standard. ""sow"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""sowce"" invalid.

""sooty"" invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""soot"" -> too short.

""soots"" -> S O O T S -> has T -> invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""sooee"" -> not a word.

""sojus"" -> S O J U S -> position 3 is J -> not O.

So it seems difficult to find a word with S at position 1 and O at position 3.

Perhaps S at position 2: ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""islet"" invalid.
- ""psalm"" invalid because of A.
- ""psst"" too short.

""ussurp"" -> U S S U R P -> has R -> invalid.

""busby"" -> B U S B Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Examples:
- ""aspen"" -> A and E -> invalid.
- ""besom"" -> B E S O M -> has E -> invalid.
- ""disco"" -> D I S C O -> has C -> invalid.
- ""fusil"" -> F U S I L -> position 3 is S -> not O.

This is not working.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have S at position 1 and then use a different letter at position 2.

For example, ""sowle"" -> not a word.

""sooty"" invalid.

I think we have to go with ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> position 3 is U -> not O.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word with S at position 5 and O at position 3.

For example, ""bogus"" -> B O G U S -> has G -> invalid.

""focus"" -> F O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""jocus"" -> J O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""locus"" -> L O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""mucus"" -> M U C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""pupus"" -> P U P U S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""pools"" is one of the few options.

""yowza"" not a word.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have S at position 5 and O at position 3, and the word might be ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""dowle"" not a word.

""howfs"" not standard.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> same.

""pools"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""bloss"" but it's not a word.

Or ""closs"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""pools"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""pools"", then we would get:
- P: ? 
- O: correct at position 3 (we know that)
- O: at position 2? If the secret word has O at position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know. We are testing.
- L: ?
- S: at position 5? If the secret word has S at position 5, then correct, else if S is at position 1 or 2, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But we are putting S at position 5.

But we know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we would get S as present but wrong position? Because the secret word has S at position 1, so our S at position 5 is wrong position.

Similarly, if the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 5 would be wrong position.

So we can get information about S's position.

Also, we test P, O (at position 2), L, and S (at position 5).

But we already know O is at position 3, so we are testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 1 or 2 to test directly.

But we are struggling to find a word.

Another word: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""swath"" -> S W A T H -> has A, T, H -> invalid.

""swell"" -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me check if there is a word like ""sowce"" but it's invalid.

Or ""sowls"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""sow"" is not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""pooch"" invalid.

I think we have to use ""pools"".

So the next guess is ""pools"".

But note: we are also testing the letter L. If L is in the word, we get feedback.

And we are testing P at position 1.

So let's do that.

<guess>pools</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- ""ghost"" showed that O is in the correct position (3rd), S is present but not in the 4th position, and G, H, T are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word has O as the 3rd letter: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Forbidden letters (absent in previous feedback): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.
- The next guess must include S (in position 1, 2, or 5) and avoid forbidden letters, while testing new common letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""pools"" fits:
- Pools has O in the 3rd position (as required).
- Pools places S in the 5th position (testing if S is at the end).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (P, O, L, S) to gather more information.

<guess>pools</guess>",pools,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""ghost"" -> 
   G: absent (x)
   H: absent (x)
   O: correct (✓) and in the right position? The feedback says O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the third letter in ""ghost"", that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
   S: present but wrong position (-)
   T: absent (x)

So, from ""ghost"":
- The third letter is O (position 3).
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- G, H, T are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the third position: _ _ O _ _
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position. Since the fourth position in ""ghost"" is S, but it's marked as wrong position, S must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's clarify:

In ""ghost"":
Position 1: G
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (correct)
Position 4: S (wrong position)
Position 5: T

So S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

And we have confirmed that O is in position 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in the third position.
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position (and not in the third because that's O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Available letters: We can use any letters except the forbidden ones: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

But we must include S and O (O is fixed at position 3).

Structure: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1, 2, or 5.

We also need to choose a word that tests other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the third position.
- Must include S (but not at position 4).
- Must not use C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Possible letters for the other positions: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that match the pattern _ _ O _ _ and contain S.

Options:
- If S is at position 1: S _ O _ _
  - Examples: ""scowp"" (not a word), ""scoop"" (but has O again? and we don't know if O is duplicated, but we only have one O so far). Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we can avoid for now to be safe.
  - ""sowce"" -> invalid.
  - ""sowls"" -> valid? S O W L S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""solo"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words: 
- ""sowce"" is not valid.
- ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W, not O. We need O at position 3.

So for S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a letter for position 2, then two more letters. And the word must have S at the end? Not necessarily, because S is already used at position 1, and we don't know if S appears twice, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one S, but if the word had two S's, we might have seen two marks? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one S in ""ghost"", and it was marked as present, but if the word has two S's, we wouldn't know. However, we can only use one S in our guess? Actually, we can use more, but we know at least one S is present.

But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

So, for S at position 1: S ? O ? ?
We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5.

Possible words: 
- ""solo"" -> too short.
- ""scold"" -> but has C and L? C is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""sold"" -> too short.
- ""solves"" -> S O L V E -> but E is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""solves"" has E -> invalid.

Another: ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""sophs"" -> S O P H S -> but H is forbidden -> invalid.

This is tricky.

Perhaps S at position 2: _ S O _ _
Then the word has S in the second position.

Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> but E and T are forbidden -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern is _ S O _ _ -> so position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, then two more.

Words: 
- ""islet"" is invalid because of E and T.
- ""psalm"" -> P S A L M -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""dossy"" -> D O S S Y -> but position 3 is S -> not O. We need O at position 3.

So: _ S O _ _ 
Possible: 
- ""usnea"" -> not a common word.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Now, S at position 5: _ _ O _ S
Then the word ends with S.

Examples:
- ""prows"" -> P R O W S -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""crowns"" -> 6 letters.
- ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern: _ _ O _ S -> so position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, then position 4: ?, position 5: S.

Words:
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S? And position 5 is S. But we have S at position 5, and also at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4 from the feedback? Wait, no: the feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4. But it can be at other positions. In ""floss"", if we put S at position 4 and 5, but we know S is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for ""ghost"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, S cannot be at position 4. So if we try a word with S at position 4, it would be incorrect. But in ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. However, we know S is not at position 4, so ""floss"" would have S at position 4 which is invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. It doesn't prevent us from guessing a word with S at position 4? But we know it's not correct, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting S at position 4.

But in our guess, we can put S anywhere, but we know that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Actually, no: if we put S at position 4, and the secret word has S but not at position 4, then the feedback will show S as present but wrong position? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting S at position 4 to conserve a slot.

So for the pattern _ _ O _ S:
We need a word with O at 3 and S at 5, and without the forbidden letters.

Example: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> but position 3 is U? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have O at position 3 and S at position 5.

Words:
- ""boughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""doughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S, which we know is not allowed? Actually, we are considering the secret word, not our guess. In the secret word, S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. But we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so the S at position 4 in our guess would be marked as absent? Because the secret word doesn't have S at position 4. But we also have S at position 5, which might be correct or not.

But we are looking for a word that fits the pattern. However, we are struggling to find a word.

Another idea: perhaps S is not at position 5? Let's list possible words.

We know the word has O at position 3 and S somewhere (not position 4). Also, the word must have exactly the letters we know? No, we don't know, there might be more letters.

We also have to consider that we have only one S so far? The feedback for ""ghost"" had only one S and it was marked as present, so likely there is only one S.

But let's think of common words.

Perhaps S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a word: S ? O ? ?

Possible: 
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 2 is O? We have O at position 3, so position 2 cannot be O? Actually, we don't know if there is another O. The feedback for ""ghost"" had O at position 3 correct, but that doesn't say anything about other O's. However, we haven't tested other O's.

But in ""sowls"", we have O at position 2 and 3? That might be acceptable, but we are avoiding forbidden letters. Also, ""sowls"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's avoid rare words.

Another: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No, we need O at position 3.

So: S ? O ? ? 

Possible: 
- ""scoot"" -> has C -> invalid.
- ""sproof"" -> too long.
- ""stool"" -> has T -> invalid.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another common word: ""mossy"" -> M O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me search for words with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""found"" -> F O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""mound"" -> M O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""round"" -> R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""sound"" -> S O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""wound"" -> W O U N D -> has N -> invalid.

All these have forbidden letters.

What about ""boughs""? 6 letters.

""crowns"" -> 6 letters.

""doughs"" -> 6 letters.

""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

""blossoms"" -> 6 letters.

This is problematic.

Perhaps ""floss"" but that has S at position 4 and 5, and we know S is not at position 4, so we cannot use that.

But wait, we can use ""floss"" as a guess? But we know S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, it would be correct? But we don't know. We only know S is in the word and not at position 4.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can guess a word that has S in a different position and tests new letters.

We know the third letter is O, and S is present (but not at position 4). So S must be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we are struggling to find a word that fits.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""sowce"" but that's invalid.

Or ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have the third letter O.

Let me think of words ending with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pooch"" -> P O O C H -> has C and H -> invalid.
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O? Yes: P(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), S(5). But we have O at position 2 and 3? That's possible. And the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in our guess, we can use ""pools"". But let's check the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

Forbidden letters: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T. P, O, L, S are allowed? O is already known, and we are using it again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's.

But we can try.

However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""pools"" has P, O, L, S -> no forbidden letters? P, O, L, S are not in the forbidden list. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So P, O, L, S are allowed.

But position 3 is O, which is correct. And we are putting S at position 5.

But we also have O at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if there is a second O.

But the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one O (at position 3) and the rest were absent. But if the secret word has two O's, then when we guessed ""ghost"" (which had one O at position 3) and the secret word has an O at position 2, then we wouldn't have known.

So ""pools"" is a candidate? But we are guessing, not the secret.

We can use ""pools"" as a guess.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""browl"" -> B R O W L -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""droll"" -> D R O L L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""fjord"" -> F J O R D -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6 letters.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me list 5-letter words with O as the third letter.

Pattern: ??O??

But we also have to include S.

So the word must have O at position 3 and S in position 1,2, or 5 (but not 4).

So:
- Position 1: S -> then word: S ? O ? ?
- Position 2: S -> then word: ? S O ? ?
- Position 5: S -> then word: ? ? O ? S

And the word must not contain forbidden letters.

Let me try to find words for each case.

Case 1: S at position 1 -> S ? O ? ?
We need a letter for position 2, and then two more. And the word must not have forbidden letters.

Possible: 
- ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No.
- ""slyly"" -> S Y L Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So: S ? O ? ?

Examples:
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think I'm missing something.

Another: ""soggy"" -> S O G G Y -> but G is forbidden -> invalid.

""sooty"" -> S O O T Y -> has T -> invalid.

""soppy"" -> S O P P Y -> position 3 is P -> not O.

This is not working.

Case 2: S at position 2 -> ? S O ? ?
Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> has E and T -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""usnea"" -> not common.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

Case 3: S at position 5 -> ? ? O ? S
Examples:
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O (good), position 5 is S (good). But we have O at position 2 as well. And letters: P, O, O, L, S -> forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. P, O, L, S are allowed. But we have two O's? That's acceptable.

Is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

But we are not sure if the secret word has two O's.

Another word: ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""floss"" -> F L O S S -> position 3 is O (good), position 4 is S (bad, because we know S is not at position 4). So we cannot use ""floss"" because it has S at position 4, which we know is wrong.

But we can use a word that has S at position 5 and O at position 3.

Other words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> has S at position 4 -> invalid for our purpose.

""pools"" seems a candidate.

Another: ""prowl"" -> P R O W L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""troll"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

""vowel"" -> V O V E L -> has E -> invalid.

""wolves"" -> W O L V E S -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

So ""pools"" is a possibility.

But let's check if there are other words.

Another: ""mowls"" -> M O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""dowly"" -> D O W L Y -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""bowls"" -> B O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" is one.

""brooks"" -> 6 letters.

""brooks"" is 6.

""brook"" -> 5 letters? B R O O K -> has R -> invalid.

""crook"" -> C and R -> invalid.

""froze"" -> F R O Z E -> has R and E -> invalid.

""globe"" -> G forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M -> not O.

""kopos"" -> K O P O S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""losos"" -> L O S O S -> position 3 is S -> not O.

""moses"" -> M O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""noses"" -> N and E -> invalid.

""posse"" -> P O S S E -> has E -> invalid.

""roses"" -> R and E -> invalid.

""soses"" -> S O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""tosses"" -> T and E -> invalid.

""voss"" -> too short.

""woss"" -> too short.

""yoss"" -> too short.

""yowza"" -> not a word.

So ""pools"" might be a good guess.

But ""pools"" has two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's. But that's okay, we can guess it.

Another word: ""dowle"" -> not a word.

""howfs"" -> not common.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> K O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other letters.

We know the secret word has S and O (at position 3). And we are going to guess ""pools"".

But let's see the pattern: P O O L S

We are testing:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O (we don't know if O is duplicated)
- Position 3: O (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for O at position 3? But we will get feedback per letter.)

But we are also testing L and the S at position 5.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then we might get feedback on that.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, O, O, L, S -> none of C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So it's okay.

But is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""dowly"" -> not a word.

""fjord"" -> has R -> invalid.

""jordy"" -> J O R D Y -> has R -> invalid.

""kiosks"" -> 6 letters.

""losars"" -> 6 letters.

""mosaics"" -> 6 letters.

So ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sulky"" -> S U L K Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sumac"" -> has C -> invalid.

""sumpt"" -> not a word.

""sunk"" -> too short.

""sulks"" -> not O at position 3.

I think ""pools"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with S at position 1.

For example, ""sowls"" is not standard. ""sow"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""sowce"" invalid.

""sooty"" invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""soot"" -> too short.

""soots"" -> S O O T S -> has T -> invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""sooee"" -> not a word.

""sojus"" -> S O J U S -> position 3 is J -> not O.

So it seems difficult to find a word with S at position 1 and O at position 3.

Perhaps S at position 2: ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""islet"" invalid.
- ""psalm"" invalid because of A.
- ""psst"" too short.

""ussurp"" -> U S S U R P -> has R -> invalid.

""busby"" -> B U S B Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Examples:
- ""aspen"" -> A and E -> invalid.
- ""besom"" -> B E S O M -> has E -> invalid.
- ""disco"" -> D I S C O -> has C -> invalid.
- ""fusil"" -> F U S I L -> position 3 is S -> not O.

This is not working.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have S at position 1 and then use a different letter at position 2.

For example, ""sowle"" -> not a word.

""sooty"" invalid.

I think we have to go with ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> position 3 is U -> not O.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word with S at position 5 and O at position 3.

For example, ""bogus"" -> B O G U S -> has G -> invalid.

""focus"" -> F O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""jocus"" -> J O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""locus"" -> L O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""mucus"" -> M U C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""pupus"" -> P U P U S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""pools"" is one of the few options.

""yowza"" not a word.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have S at position 5 and O at position 3, and the word might be ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""dowle"" not a word.

""howfs"" not standard.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> same.

""pools"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""bloss"" but it's not a word.

Or ""closs"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""pools"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""pools"", then we would get:
- P: ? 
- O: correct at position 3 (we know that)
- O: at position 2? If the secret word has O at position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know. We are testing.
- L: ?
- S: at position 5? If the secret word has S at position 5, then correct, else if S is at position 1 or 2, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But we are putting S at position 5.

But we know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we would get S as present but wrong position? Because the secret word has S at position 1, so our S at position 5 is wrong position.

Similarly, if the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 5 would be wrong position.

So we can get information about S's position.

Also, we test P, O (at position 2), L, and S (at position 5).

But we already know O is at position 3, so we are testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 1 or 2 to test directly.

But we are struggling to find a word.

Another word: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""swath"" -> S W A T H -> has A, T, H -> invalid.

""swell"" -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me check if there is a word like ""sowce"" but it's invalid.

Or ""sowls"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""sow"" is not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""pooch"" invalid.

I think we have to use ""pools"".

So the next guess is ""pools"".

But note: we are also testing the letter L. If L is in the word, we get feedback.

And we are testing P at position 1.

So let's do that.

<guess>pools</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- ""ghost"" showed that O is in the correct position (3rd), S is present but not in the 4th position, and G, H, T are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word has O as the 3rd letter: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Forbidden letters (absent in previous feedback): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.
- The next guess must include S (in position 1, 2, or 5) and avoid forbidden letters, while testing new common letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""pools"" fits:
- Pools has O in the 3rd position (as required).
- Pools places S in the 5th position (testing if S is at the end).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (P, O, L, S) to gather more information.",Guess 3: pools -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) O(✓) L(x) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should aim for a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the secret word.

 Some good starting letters (besides the ones we already tried and failed) might include: S, T, L, O, P, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word without the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

 Example words: 
   ""sight"" -> uses S, I, G, H, T -> none of the forbidden letters.
   ""could"" -> but has C and we know C is out -> not allowed.
   ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> not allowed.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me think of a word: 
   ""slimy"" -> S, L, I, M, Y -> no forbidden letters? 
        S: allowed, L: allowed, I: allowed, M: allowed, Y: allowed.

 But is ""slimy"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""ghost"" -> G, H, O, S, T -> no forbidden letters? 
        G, H, O, S, T are all allowed.

 ""ghost"" is a common word and might be a good choice.

 Another option: ""built"" -> but we need 5 letters, so ""build"" -> but has U, I, L, D -> but D is allowed? 
        But ""build"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""build"" is 5 letters: B,U,I,L,D.

 However, we have to avoid E and we are not using any forbidden. But let's check: 
        B: allowed, U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, D: allowed.

 But we might want to cover more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U.

 We haven't tested O or U yet. So maybe a word with O and U would be good.

 Example: ""pouty"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> all allowed.

 However, I think ""ghost"" is a solid choice because it has common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O).

 Alternatively, ""stomp"" -> S, T, O, M, P -> all allowed.

 But note: we have already tried S and T? Actually, we haven't tried them in the context of the secret word, but we know that in the first guess, S, T, O, M, P were not tried because we used ""crane"". Wait, no: the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x's, so the secret word does not contain any of C, R, A, N, E. But we haven't tested S, T, O, M, P, etc.

 So, let's choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 I think ""ghost"" is a good candidate.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""shtik"" but that is not very common. 

 Alternatively, ""moult"" -> M, O, U, L, T -> all allowed.

 But I think ""ghost"" is more common.

 Let me go with ""ghost"".

 So, the next guess is ""ghost"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.

For the second guess, I selected ""ghost"" because:
- It uses common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O) not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It provides broad coverage of new letters to gather more information.

<guess>ghost</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ghost -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(x) O(✓) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""ghost"" -> 
   G: absent (x)
   H: absent (x)
   O: correct (✓) and in the right position? The feedback says O(✓), which means O is in the word and in the correct position. Since it was the third letter in ""ghost"", that means the third letter of the secret word is O.
   S: present but wrong position (-)
   T: absent (x)

So, from ""ghost"":
- The third letter is O (position 3).
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it's marked as wrong position).
- G, H, T are absent.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter O in the third position: _ _ O _ _
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position. Since the fourth position in ""ghost"" is S, but it's marked as wrong position, S must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let's clarify:

In ""ghost"":
Position 1: G
Position 2: H
Position 3: O (correct)
Position 4: S (wrong position)
Position 5: T

So S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

And we have confirmed that O is in position 3.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in the third position.
- Includes the letter S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the fourth position (and not in the third because that's O).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Available letters: We can use any letters except the forbidden ones: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

But we must include S and O (O is fixed at position 3).

Structure: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1, 2, or 5.

We also need to choose a word that tests other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Let's think of words that fit:
- Must have O in the third position.
- Must include S (but not at position 4).
- Must not use C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.

Possible letters for the other positions: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Let me try to think of words that match the pattern _ _ O _ _ and contain S.

Options:
- If S is at position 1: S _ O _ _
  - Examples: ""scowp"" (not a word), ""scoop"" (but has O again? and we don't know if O is duplicated, but we only have one O so far). Actually, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we can avoid for now to be safe.
  - ""sowce"" -> invalid.
  - ""sowls"" -> valid? S O W L S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""solo"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words: 
- ""sowce"" is not valid.
- ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W, not O. We need O at position 3.

So for S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a letter for position 2, then two more letters. And the word must have S at the end? Not necessarily, because S is already used at position 1, and we don't know if S appears twice, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

But note: the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one S, but if the word had two S's, we might have seen two marks? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one S in ""ghost"", and it was marked as present, but if the word has two S's, we wouldn't know. However, we can only use one S in our guess? Actually, we can use more, but we know at least one S is present.

But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.

So, for S at position 1: S ? O ? ?
We need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5.

Possible words: 
- ""solo"" -> too short.
- ""scold"" -> but has C and L? C is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""sold"" -> too short.
- ""solves"" -> S O L V E -> but E is forbidden -> not allowed.
- ""solves"" has E -> invalid.

Another: ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""sophs"" -> S O P H S -> but H is forbidden -> invalid.

This is tricky.

Perhaps S at position 2: _ S O _ _
Then the word has S in the second position.

Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> but E and T are forbidden -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern is _ S O _ _ -> so position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, then two more.

Words: 
- ""islet"" is invalid because of E and T.
- ""psalm"" -> P S A L M -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""dossy"" -> D O S S Y -> but position 3 is S -> not O. We need O at position 3.

So: _ S O _ _ 
Possible: 
- ""usnea"" -> not a common word.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Now, S at position 5: _ _ O _ S
Then the word ends with S.

Examples:
- ""prows"" -> P R O W S -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""crowns"" -> 6 letters.
- ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern: _ _ O _ S -> so position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, then position 4: ?, position 5: S.

Words:
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S? And position 5 is S. But we have S at position 5, and also at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4 from the feedback? Wait, no: the feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4. But it can be at other positions. In ""floss"", if we put S at position 4 and 5, but we know S is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for ""ghost"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, S cannot be at position 4. So if we try a word with S at position 4, it would be incorrect. But in ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. However, we know S is not at position 4, so ""floss"" would have S at position 4 which is invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. It doesn't prevent us from guessing a word with S at position 4? But we know it's not correct, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting S at position 4.

But in our guess, we can put S anywhere, but we know that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Actually, no: if we put S at position 4, and the secret word has S but not at position 4, then the feedback will show S as present but wrong position? But we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid putting S at position 4 to conserve a slot.

So for the pattern _ _ O _ S:
We need a word with O at 3 and S at 5, and without the forbidden letters.

Example: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> but position 3 is U? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have O at position 3 and S at position 5.

Words:
- ""boughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""doughs"" -> 6 letters.
- ""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S, which we know is not allowed? Actually, we are considering the secret word, not our guess. In the secret word, S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. But we know the secret word doesn't have S at position 4, so the S at position 4 in our guess would be marked as absent? Because the secret word doesn't have S at position 4. But we also have S at position 5, which might be correct or not.

But we are looking for a word that fits the pattern. However, we are struggling to find a word.

Another idea: perhaps S is not at position 5? Let's list possible words.

We know the word has O at position 3 and S somewhere (not position 4). Also, the word must have exactly the letters we know? No, we don't know, there might be more letters.

We also have to consider that we have only one S so far? The feedback for ""ghost"" had only one S and it was marked as present, so likely there is only one S.

But let's think of common words.

Perhaps S at position 1: S _ O _ _
We need a word: S ? O ? ?

Possible: 
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 2 is O? We have O at position 3, so position 2 cannot be O? Actually, we don't know if there is another O. The feedback for ""ghost"" had O at position 3 correct, but that doesn't say anything about other O's. However, we haven't tested other O's.

But in ""sowls"", we have O at position 2 and 3? That might be acceptable, but we are avoiding forbidden letters. Also, ""sowls"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.

But let's avoid rare words.

Another: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No, we need O at position 3.

So: S ? O ? ? 

Possible: 
- ""scoot"" -> has C -> invalid.
- ""sproof"" -> too long.
- ""stool"" -> has T -> invalid.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another common word: ""mossy"" -> M O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me search for words with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""found"" -> F O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""mound"" -> M O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""round"" -> R is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""sound"" -> S O U N D -> has N -> invalid.
- ""wound"" -> W O U N D -> has N -> invalid.

All these have forbidden letters.

What about ""boughs""? 6 letters.

""crowns"" -> 6 letters.

""doughs"" -> 6 letters.

""toughs"" -> 6 letters.

""blossoms"" -> 6 letters.

This is problematic.

Perhaps ""floss"" but that has S at position 4 and 5, and we know S is not at position 4, so we cannot use that.

But wait, we can use ""floss"" as a guess? But we know S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, it would be correct? But we don't know. We only know S is in the word and not at position 4.

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can guess a word that has S in a different position and tests new letters.

We know the third letter is O, and S is present (but not at position 4). So S must be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we are struggling to find a word that fits.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""sowce"" but that's invalid.

Or ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have the third letter O.

Let me think of words ending with O in the third position.

For example:
- ""pooch"" -> P O O C H -> has C and H -> invalid.
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O? Yes: P(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), S(5). But we have O at position 2 and 3? That's possible. And the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in our guess, we can use ""pools"". But let's check the letters: P, O, O, L, S.

Forbidden letters: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T. P, O, L, S are allowed? O is already known, and we are using it again. But we don't know if the secret word has two O's.

But we can try.

However, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""pools"" has P, O, L, S -> no forbidden letters? P, O, L, S are not in the forbidden list. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So P, O, L, S are allowed.

But position 3 is O, which is correct. And we are putting S at position 5.

But we also have O at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know if there is a second O.

But the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one O (at position 3) and the rest were absent. But if the secret word has two O's, then when we guessed ""ghost"" (which had one O at position 3) and the secret word has an O at position 2, then we wouldn't have known.

So ""pools"" is a candidate? But we are guessing, not the secret.

We can use ""pools"" as a guess.

But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: ""browl"" -> B R O W L -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""droll"" -> D R O L L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""fjord"" -> F J O R D -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6 letters.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M? No, we need O at position 3.

We need the third letter to be O.

Let me list 5-letter words with O as the third letter.

Pattern: ??O??

But we also have to include S.

So the word must have O at position 3 and S in position 1,2, or 5 (but not 4).

So:
- Position 1: S -> then word: S ? O ? ?
- Position 2: S -> then word: ? S O ? ?
- Position 5: S -> then word: ? ? O ? S

And the word must not contain forbidden letters.

Let me try to find words for each case.

Case 1: S at position 1 -> S ? O ? ?
We need a letter for position 2, and then two more. And the word must not have forbidden letters.

Possible: 
- ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No.
- ""slyly"" -> S Y L Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So: S ? O ? ?

Examples:
- ""sowce"" -> invalid.
- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think I'm missing something.

Another: ""soggy"" -> S O G G Y -> but G is forbidden -> invalid.

""sooty"" -> S O O T Y -> has T -> invalid.

""soppy"" -> S O P P Y -> position 3 is P -> not O.

This is not working.

Case 2: S at position 2 -> ? S O ? ?
Examples:
- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> has E and T -> invalid.
- ""psst"" -> too short.
- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""usnea"" -> not common.
- ""loswa"" -> not a word.

Case 3: S at position 5 -> ? ? O ? S
Examples:
- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O (good), position 5 is S (good). But we have O at position 2 as well. And letters: P, O, O, L, S -> forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. P, O, L, S are allowed. But we have two O's? That's acceptable.

Is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

But we are not sure if the secret word has two O's.

Another word: ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""floss"" -> F L O S S -> position 3 is O (good), position 4 is S (bad, because we know S is not at position 4). So we cannot use ""floss"" because it has S at position 4, which we know is wrong.

But we can use a word that has S at position 5 and O at position 3.

Other words: 
- ""bloss"" -> not a word.
- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.
- ""floss"" -> has S at position 4 -> invalid for our purpose.

""pools"" seems a candidate.

Another: ""prowl"" -> P R O W L -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""troll"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

""vowel"" -> V O V E L -> has E -> invalid.

""wolves"" -> W O L V E S -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

So ""pools"" is a possibility.

But let's check if there are other words.

Another: ""mowls"" -> M O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""dowly"" -> D O W L Y -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""bowls"" -> B O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" is one.

""brooks"" -> 6 letters.

""brooks"" is 6.

""brook"" -> 5 letters? B R O O K -> has R -> invalid.

""crook"" -> C and R -> invalid.

""froze"" -> F R O Z E -> has R and E -> invalid.

""globe"" -> G forbidden -> invalid.

""gloomy"" -> 6.

""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M -> not O.

""kopos"" -> K O P O S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""losos"" -> L O S O S -> position 3 is S -> not O.

""moses"" -> M O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""noses"" -> N and E -> invalid.

""posse"" -> P O S S E -> has E -> invalid.

""roses"" -> R and E -> invalid.

""soses"" -> S O S E S -> has E -> invalid.

""tosses"" -> T and E -> invalid.

""voss"" -> too short.

""woss"" -> too short.

""yoss"" -> too short.

""yowza"" -> not a word.

So ""pools"" might be a good guess.

But ""pools"" has two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's. But that's okay, we can guess it.

Another word: ""dowle"" -> not a word.

""howfs"" -> not common.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> K O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""pools"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider that we are also testing other letters.

We know the secret word has S and O (at position 3). And we are going to guess ""pools"".

But let's see the pattern: P O O L S

We are testing:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O (we don't know if O is duplicated)
- Position 3: O (we know it's correct, so we expect a check for O at position 3? But we will get feedback per letter.)

But we are also testing L and the S at position 5.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then we might get feedback on that.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, O, O, L, S -> none of C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So it's okay.

But is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.

Another candidate: ""dowly"" -> not a word.

""fjord"" -> has R -> invalid.

""jordy"" -> J O R D Y -> has R -> invalid.

""kiosks"" -> 6 letters.

""losars"" -> 6 letters.

""mosaics"" -> 6 letters.

So ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have another option: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sulky"" -> S U L K Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""sumac"" -> has C -> invalid.

""sumpt"" -> not a word.

""sunk"" -> too short.

""sulks"" -> not O at position 3.

I think ""pools"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there is a word with S at position 1.

For example, ""sowls"" is not standard. ""sow"" is 4 letters.

Another: ""sowce"" invalid.

""sooty"" invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""soot"" -> too short.

""soots"" -> S O O T S -> has T -> invalid.

""sooty"" has T -> invalid.

""sooee"" -> not a word.

""sojus"" -> S O J U S -> position 3 is J -> not O.

So it seems difficult to find a word with S at position 1 and O at position 3.

Perhaps S at position 2: ? S O ? ?

Words:
- ""islet"" invalid.
- ""psalm"" invalid because of A.
- ""psst"" too short.

""ussurp"" -> U S S U R P -> has R -> invalid.

""busby"" -> B U S B Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.

We need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?

Examples:
- ""aspen"" -> A and E -> invalid.
- ""besom"" -> B E S O M -> has E -> invalid.
- ""disco"" -> D I S C O -> has C -> invalid.
- ""fusil"" -> F U S I L -> position 3 is S -> not O.

This is not working.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have S at position 1 and then use a different letter at position 2.

For example, ""sowle"" -> not a word.

""sooty"" invalid.

I think we have to go with ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> position 3 is U -> not O.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But let me see if there is a word with S at position 5 and O at position 3.

For example, ""bogus"" -> B O G U S -> has G -> invalid.

""focus"" -> F O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""jocus"" -> J O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""locus"" -> L O C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""mucus"" -> M U C U S -> has C -> invalid.

""pupus"" -> P U P U S -> position 3 is P -> not O.

""pools"" is one of the few options.

""yowza"" not a word.

So I think ""pools"" is a good guess.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have S at position 5 and O at position 3, and the word might be ""pools"" or similar.

Another word: ""dowle"" not a word.

""howfs"" not standard.

""jowls"" -> J O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

""kowls"" -> same.

""pools"" is acceptable.

We can also consider ""bloss"" but it's not a word.

Or ""closs"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""pools"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the secret word is ""pools"", then we would get:
- P: ? 
- O: correct at position 3 (we know that)
- O: at position 2? If the secret word has O at position 2, then it would be correct? But we don't know. We are testing.
- L: ?
- S: at position 5? If the secret word has S at position 5, then correct, else if S is at position 1 or 2, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But we are putting S at position 5.

But we know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we would get S as present but wrong position? Because the secret word has S at position 1, so our S at position 5 is wrong position.

Similarly, if the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 5 would be wrong position.

So we can get information about S's position.

Also, we test P, O (at position 2), L, and S (at position 5).

But we already know O is at position 3, so we are testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 1 or 2 to test directly.

But we are struggling to find a word.

Another word: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.

""swath"" -> S W A T H -> has A, T, H -> invalid.

""swell"" -> has E -> invalid.

""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.

I think ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me check if there is a word like ""sowce"" but it's invalid.

Or ""sowls"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""sow"" is not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""pooch"" invalid.

I think we have to use ""pools"".

So the next guess is ""pools"".

But note: we are also testing the letter L. If L is in the word, we get feedback.

And we are testing P at position 1.

So let's do that.

<guess>pools</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- ""ghost"" showed that O is in the correct position (3rd), S is present but not in the 4th position, and G, H, T are absent.

Key insights:
- The secret word has O as the 3rd letter: _ _ O _ _
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Forbidden letters (absent in previous feedback): C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.
- The next guess must include S (in position 1, 2, or 5) and avoid forbidden letters, while testing new common letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""pools"" fits:
- Pools has O in the 3rd position (as required).
- Pools places S in the 5th position (testing if S is at the end).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (P, O, L, S) to gather more information.

But let\'s check: \n        B: allowed, U: allowed, I: allowed, L: allowed, D: allowed.\n\n But we might want to cover more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U.\n\n We haven\'t tested O or U yet.

Actually, we haven\'t tried them in the context of the secret word, but we know that in the first guess, S, T, O, M, P were not tried because we used ""crane"". Wait, no: the first guess was ""crane"" and we got all x\'s, so the secret word does not contain any of C, R, A, N, E. But we haven\'t tested S, T, O, M, P, etc.\n\n So, let\'s choose a word that uses as many new common letters as possible.\n\n I think ""ghost"" is a good candidate.\n\n However, let me check if there is a word that uses more common letters. Another common starting word that avoids these letters is ""shtik"" but that is not very common. \n\n Alternatively, ""moult"" -> M, O, U, L, T -> all allowed.\n\n But I think ""ghost"" is more common.\n\n Let me go with ""ghost"".\n\n So, the next guess is ""ghost"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), the secret word contains none of these letters. Therefore, the next guess must avoid these 5 letters entirely.\n\nFor the second guess, I selected ""ghost"" because:\n- It uses common consonants (G, H, S, T) and a vowel (O) not yet tested.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It provides broad coverage of new letters to gather more information.\n\n<guess>ghost</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ghost -> FEEDBACK: G(x) H(x) O(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

Since it was the third letter in ""ghost"", that means the third letter of the secret word is O.\n   S: present but wrong position (-)\n   T: absent (x)\n\nSo, from ""ghost"":\n- The third letter is O (position 3).\n- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we guessed it there and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n- G, H, T are absent.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word has the letter O in the third position: _ _ O _ _\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the fourth position. Since the fourth position in ""ghost"" is S, but it\'s marked as wrong position, S must be in one of the other positions: 1, 2, or 5. But note: positions are 1-indexed? Let\'s clarify:\n\nIn ""ghost"":\nPosition 1: G\nPosition 2: H\nPosition 3: O (correct)\nPosition 4: S (wrong position)\nPosition 5: T\n\nSo S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.\n\nAnd we have confirmed that O is in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that:\n- Has O in the third position.\n- Includes the letter S (since we know it\'s in the word) but not in the fourth position (and not in the third because that\'s O).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letters except the forbidden ones: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.\n\nBut we must include S and O (O is fixed at position 3).\n\nStructure: _ _ O _ _\n\nWe know S is in the word but not at position 4. So S can be at position 1, 2, or 5.\n\nWe also need to choose a word that tests other common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- Must have O in the third position.\n- Must include S (but not at position 4).\n- Must not use C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T.\n\nPossible letters for the other positions: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nLet me try to think of words that match the pattern _ _ O _ _ and contain S.\n\nOptions:\n- If S is at position 1: S _ O _ _\n  - Examples: ""scowp"" (not a word), ""scoop"" (but has O again? and we don\'t know if O is duplicated, but we only have one O so far). Actually, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but we can avoid for now to be safe.\n  - ""sowce"" -> invalid.\n  - ""sowls"" -> valid? S O W L S -> but position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""solo"" is 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nActually, 5-letter words: \n- ""sowce"" is not valid.\n- ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W, not O. We need O at position 3.\n\nSo for S at position 1: S _ O _ _\nWe need a letter for position 2, then two more letters. And the word must have S at the end? Not necessarily, because S is already used at position 1, and we don\'t know if S appears twice, but we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one S, but if the word had two S\'s, we might have seen two marks? Actually, the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only had one S in ""ghost"", and it was marked as present, but if the word has two S\'s, we wouldn\'t know. However, we can only use one S in our guess? Actually, we can use more, but we know at least one S is present.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s avoid assuming duplicates until we have evidence.\n\nSo, for S at position 1: S ? O ? ?\nWe need to fill positions 2, 4, and 5.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""solo"" -> too short.\n- ""scold"" -> but has C and L? C is forbidden -> not allowed.\n- ""sold"" -> too short.\n- ""solves"" -> S O L V E -> but E is forbidden -> not allowed.\n- ""solves"" has E -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So S _ O _ _ -> for example, ""sophs"" -> S O P H S -> but H is forbidden -> invalid.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps S at position 2: _ S O _ _\nThen the word has S in the second position.\n\nExamples:\n- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> but E and T are forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""psst"" -> too short.\n- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern is _ S O _ _ -> so position 1: ?, position 2: S, position 3: O, then two more.\n\nWords: \n- ""islet"" is invalid because of E and T.\n- ""psalm"" -> P S A L M -> but A is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""dossy"" -> D O S S Y -> but position 3 is S -> not O. We need O at position 3.\n\nSo: _ S O _ _ \nPossible: \n- ""usnea"" -> not a common word.\n- ""loswa"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nNow, S at position 5: _ _ O _ S\nThen the word ends with S.\n\nExamples:\n- ""prows"" -> P R O W S -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""crowns"" -> 6 letters.\n- ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the pattern: _ _ O _ S -> so position 1: ?, position 2: ?, position 3: O, then position 4: ?, position 5: S.\n\nWords:\n- ""bloss"" -> not a word.\n- ""closs"" -> C is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S? And position 5 is S. But we have S at position 5, and also at position 4? But we know S is not at position 4 from the feedback? Wait, no: the feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4. So S cannot be at position 4. But it can be at other positions. In ""floss"", if we put S at position 4 and 5, but we know S is not at position 4? Actually, the feedback for ""ghost"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning that S is in the word but not at position 4. Therefore, in the secret word, S cannot be at position 4. So if we try a word with S at position 4, it would be incorrect. But in ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. However, we know S is not at position 4, so ""floss"" would have S at position 4 which is invalid? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. It doesn\'t prevent us from guessing a word with S at position 4? But we know it\'s not correct, so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting S at position 4.\n\nBut in our guess, we can put S anywhere, but we know that in the secret word, S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4 in a guess, we know it will be marked as absent? Actually, no: if we put S at position 4, and the secret word has S but not at position 4, then the feedback will show S as present but wrong position? But we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid putting S at position 4 to conserve a slot.\n\nSo for the pattern _ _ O _ S:\nWe need a word with O at 3 and S at 5, and without the forbidden letters.\n\nExample: ""pouls"" -> P O U L S -> but position 3 is U? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have O at position 3 and S at position 5.\n\nWords:\n- ""boughs"" -> 6 letters.\n- ""doughs"" -> 6 letters.\n- ""toughs"" -> 6 letters.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""bloss"" -> not a word.\n- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.\n- ""floss"" -> F L O S S -> but then position 4 is S, which we know is not allowed? Actually, we are considering the secret word, not our guess. In the secret word, S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", we have S at position 4 and 5. But we know the secret word doesn\'t have S at position 4, so the S at position 4 in our guess would be marked as absent? Because the secret word doesn\'t have S at position 4. But we also have S at position 5, which might be correct or not.\n\nBut we are looking for a word that fits the pattern. However, we are struggling to find a word.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps S is not at position 5? Let\'s list possible words.\n\nWe know the word has O at position 3 and S somewhere (not position 4). Also, the word must have exactly the letters we know? No, we don\'t know, there might be more letters.\n\nWe also have to consider that we have only one S so far? The feedback for ""ghost"" had only one S and it was marked as present, so likely there is only one S.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words.\n\nPerhaps S at position 1: S _ O _ _\nWe need a word: S ? O ? ?\n\nPossible: \n- ""sowce"" -> invalid.\n- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> but then position 2 is O? We have O at position 3, so position 2 cannot be O? Actually, we don\'t know if there is another O. The feedback for ""ghost"" had O at position 3 correct, but that doesn\'t say anything about other O\'s. However, we haven\'t tested other O\'s.\n\nBut in ""sowls"", we have O at position 2 and 3? That might be acceptable, but we are avoiding forbidden letters. Also, ""sowls"" is a word? It means a type of hawk, I think.\n\nBut let\'s avoid rare words.\n\nAnother: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No, we need O at position 3.\n\nSo: S ? O ? ? \n\nPossible: \n- ""scoot"" -> has C -> invalid.\n- ""sproof"" -> too long.\n- ""stool"" -> has T -> invalid.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother common word: ""mossy"" -> M O S S Y -> but position 3 is S? No, we need O at position 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be O.\n\nLet me search for words with O in the third position.\n\nFor example:\n- ""pound"" -> has U, O, N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""found"" -> F O U N D -> has N -> invalid.\n- ""mound"" -> M O U N D -> has N -> invalid.\n- ""round"" -> R is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""sound"" -> S O U N D -> has N -> invalid.\n- ""wound"" -> W O U N D -> has N -> invalid.\n\nAll these have forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about ""boughs""? 6 letters.\n\n""crowns"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""doughs"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""toughs"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""blossoms"" -> 6 letters.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps ""floss"" but that has S at position 4 and 5, and we know S is not at position 4, so we cannot use that.\n\nBut wait, we can use ""floss"" as a guess? But we know S is not at position 4, so if we guess ""floss"", then:\n- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, it would be correct? But we don\'t know. We only know S is in the word and not at position 4.\n\nBut we are trying to find the secret word, so we can guess a word that has S in a different position and tests new letters.\n\nWe know the third letter is O, and S is present (but not at position 4). So S must be at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut we are struggling to find a word that fits.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""sowce"" but that\'s invalid.\n\nOr ""sowls"": S O W L S -> but then position 3 is W? No, we need O at position 3. So the word must have the third letter O.\n\nLet me think of words ending with O in the third position.\n\nFor example:\n- ""pooch"" -> P O O C H -> has C and H -> invalid.\n- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O? Yes: P(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), S(5). But we have O at position 2 and 3? That\'s possible. And the letters: P, O, O, L, S.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? The secret word might have two O\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our guess, we can use ""pools"". But let\'s check the letters: P, O, O, L, S.\n\nForbidden letters: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T. P, O, L, S are allowed? O is already known, and we are using it again. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two O\'s.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""pools"" has P, O, L, S -> no forbidden letters? P, O, L, S are not in the forbidden list. Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So P, O, L, S are allowed.\n\nBut position 3 is O, which is correct. And we are putting S at position 5.\n\nBut we also have O at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t know if there is a second O.\n\nBut the feedback for ""ghost"" only showed one O (at position 3) and the rest were absent. But if the secret word has two O\'s, then when we guessed ""ghost"" (which had one O at position 3) and the secret word has an O at position 2, then we wouldn\'t have known.\n\nSo ""pools"" is a candidate? But we are guessing, not the secret.\n\nWe can use ""pools"" as a guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are better words.\n\nAnother word: ""browl"" -> B R O W L -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""droll"" -> D R O L L -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""fjord"" -> F J O R D -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""gloomy"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M? No, we need O at position 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be O.\n\nLet me list 5-letter words with O as the third letter.\n\nPattern: ??O??\n\nBut we also have to include S.\n\nSo the word must have O at position 3 and S in position 1,2, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: S -> then word: S ? O ? ?\n- Position 2: S -> then word: ? S O ? ?\n- Position 5: S -> then word: ? ? O ? S\n\nAnd the word must not contain forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to find words for each case.\n\nCase 1: S at position 1 -> S ? O ? ?\nWe need a letter for position 2, and then two more. And the word must not have forbidden letters.\n\nPossible: \n- ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L? No.\n- ""slyly"" -> S Y L Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O.\n\nSo: S ? O ? ?\n\nExamples:\n- ""sowce"" -> invalid.\n- ""sowls"" -> S O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\nI think I\'m missing something.\n\nAnother: ""soggy"" -> S O G G Y -> but G is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""sooty"" -> S O O T Y -> has T -> invalid.\n\n""soppy"" -> S O P P Y -> position 3 is P -> not O.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nCase 2: S at position 2 -> ? S O ? ?\nExamples:\n- ""islet"" -> I S L E T -> has E and T -> invalid.\n- ""psst"" -> too short.\n- ""bossy"" -> B O S S Y -> position 3 is S -> not O.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O, so position 2 is S and position 3 is O: so ? S O ? ?\n\nWords:\n- ""usnea"" -> not common.\n- ""loswa"" -> not a word.\n\nCase 3: S at position 5 -> ? ? O ? S\nExamples:\n- ""pools"" -> P O O L S -> position 3 is O (good), position 5 is S (good). But we have O at position 2 as well. And letters: P, O, O, L, S -> forbidden letters: no C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. P, O, L, S are allowed. But we have two O\'s? That\'s acceptable.\n\nIs ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we are not sure if the secret word has two O\'s.\n\nAnother word: ""dowls"" -> D O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\n""floss"" -> F L O S S -> position 3 is O (good), position 4 is S (bad, because we know S is not at position 4). So we cannot use ""floss"" because it has S at position 4, which we know is wrong.\n\nBut we can use a word that has S at position 5 and O at position 3.\n\nOther words: \n- ""bloss"" -> not a word.\n- ""closs"" -> C forbidden.\n- ""floss"" -> has S at position 4 -> invalid for our purpose.\n\n""pools"" seems a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""prowl"" -> P R O W L -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""troll"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""vowel"" -> V O V E L -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""wolves"" -> W O L V E S -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\nSo ""pools"" is a possibility.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\nAnother: ""mowls"" -> M O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\n""dowly"" -> D O W L Y -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\n""bowls"" -> B O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\n""pools"" is one.\n\n""brooks"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""brooks"" is 6.\n\n""brook"" -> 5 letters? B R O O K -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""crook"" -> C and R -> invalid.\n\n""froze"" -> F R O Z E -> has R and E -> invalid.\n\n""globe"" -> G forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""gloomy"" -> 6.\n\n""jumbo"" -> J U M B O -> position 3 is M -> not O.\n\n""kopos"" -> K O P O S -> position 3 is P -> not O.\n\n""losos"" -> L O S O S -> position 3 is S -> not O.\n\n""moses"" -> M O S E S -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""noses"" -> N and E -> invalid.\n\n""posse"" -> P O S S E -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""roses"" -> R and E -> invalid.\n\n""soses"" -> S O S E S -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""tosses"" -> T and E -> invalid.\n\n""voss"" -> too short.\n\n""woss"" -> too short.\n\n""yoss"" -> too short.\n\n""yowza"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""pools"" might be a good guess.\n\nBut ""pools"" has two O\'s.

But we will get feedback per letter.)\n\nBut we are also testing L and the S at position 5.\n\nIf the secret word has O at position 2, then we might get feedback on that.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, O, O, L, S -> none of C,R,A,N,E,G,H,T. So it\'s okay.\n\nBut is ""pools"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""dowly"" -> not a word.\n\n""fjord"" -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""jordy"" -> J O R D Y -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""kiosks"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""losars"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""mosaics"" -> 6 letters.\n\nSo ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we have another option: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.\n\n""sulky"" -> S U L K Y -> position 3 is L -> not O.\n\n""sumac"" -> has C -> invalid.\n\n""sumpt"" -> not a word.\n\n""sunk"" -> too short.\n\n""sulks"" -> not O at position 3.\n\nI think ""pools"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with S at position 1.\n\nFor example, ""sowls"" is not standard.

If the secret word has O at position 2, then it would be correct? But we don\'t know. We are testing.\n- L: ?\n- S: at position 5? If the secret word has S at position 5, then correct, else if S is at position 1 or 2, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But we are putting S at position 5.\n\nBut we know S is in the word, so if we put S at position 5 and the secret word has S at position 1, then we would get S as present but wrong position? Because the secret word has S at position 1, so our S at position 5 is wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, if the secret word has S at position 2, then S at position 5 would be wrong position.\n\nSo we can get information about S\'s position.\n\nAlso, we test P, O (at position 2), L, and S (at position 5).\n\nBut we already know O is at position 3, so we are testing the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has S at position 1 or 2 to test directly.\n\nBut we are struggling to find a word.\n\nAnother word: ""sulks"" -> S U L K S -> position 3 is L -> not O.\n\n""swath"" -> S W A T H -> has A, T, H -> invalid.\n\n""swell"" -> has E -> invalid.\n\n""yowls"" -> Y O W L S -> position 3 is W -> not O.\n\nI think ""pools"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word like ""sowce"" but it\'s invalid.\n\nOr ""sowls"" is not standard.\n\nPerhaps ""sow"" is not 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""pooch"" invalid.\n\nI think we have to use ""pools"".\n\nSo the next guess is ""pools"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing the letter L.

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""ghost"" -> 
   G: absent
   H: absent
   O: correct at position 3 (so the secret word has O as the third letter: _ _ O _ _)
   S: present but not at position 4 (so S is in the word, but not at position 4; and since position 3 is O, S must be at position 1, 2, or 5)
   T: absent
3. ""pools"" ->
   P: correct at position 1 (so the secret word has P as the first letter: P _ O _ _)
   O: correct at position 2 and 3 (so O is at position 2 and 3? But we already knew position 3 is O, now we know position 2 is also O? The feedback shows O(✓) for the second position? Let's clarify the feedback for ""pools"":

   Pools: 
      Position 1: P -> ✓ (correct)
      Position 2: O -> ✓ (correct) -> so the second letter is O?
      Position 3: O -> ✓ (correct) -> we already knew this
      Position 4: L -> x (not in the word)
      Position 5: S -> ✓ (correct) -> so the fifth letter is S?

   But wait, the feedback for ""pools"":
      P(✓) O(✓) O(✓) L(x) S(✓)

   This means:
      Position 1: P is correct -> so the first letter is P.
      Position 2: O is correct -> so the second letter is O.
      Position 3: O is correct -> we knew this.
      Position 4: L is absent -> so L is not in the word.
      Position 5: S is correct -> so the fifth letter is S.

   Therefore, the secret word is: P O O _ S

   But we have four letters: P, O, O, S, and one missing letter at position 4.

   And we know that the fourth letter cannot be L (because L is absent) and also cannot be any of the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L (now we know L is absent).

   Also, we know the secret word has no duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but in this case, we have two O's and two letters: P and S. But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

   So the word is ""POO?S"", and the fourth letter is missing.

   But wait, we have feedback that L is absent, so the fourth letter is not L.

   Now, what are the possible words? We need a 5-letter word of the form POO?S.

   Common words: 
      ""POOPS"" -> but that has P at position 1, O at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5? But we have two P's? And we know P is at position 1, so if we put P at position 4, that would be a duplicate. But is ""poops"" a word? It's informal, but let's see.

   More common: ""POUSY"" -> but that ends with Y, not S.

   We need to end with S.

   ""POOTS"" -> P O O T S -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is absent). So invalid.

   ""POOFS"" -> P O O F S -> F is allowed? We haven't tested F. And F is not forbidden. So ""poofs"" is a word.

   ""POOPS"" -> P O O P S -> but we have two P's. Is that possible? We don't know. But we haven't ruled out duplicates.

   ""POOCH"" -> has C -> invalid.

   ""POODS"" -> P O O D S -> D is allowed. ""poods"" is a word? It means something in biology, but it's rare.

   ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are options.

   But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had no P, and now we have P at position 1. But in the first guess, we didn't test P.

   However, we know that the secret word has no C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L (from the absent letters).

   So for the fourth position, it cannot be any of these.

   Now, we have two possibilities: ""poofs"" and ""poods"". But we need to choose one.

   Alternatively, we can guess one of them to solve the word.

   But we are in the fourth guess, and we have two options. We can guess one.

   However, we also have to consider that we might have missed something.

   Let me list all 5-letter words with P O O _ S.

   Common ones:
      ""POOFS"" (meaning a foolish act)
      ""POODS"" (plural of pod, in biology)
      ""POOTS"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
      ""POOCH"" -> C forbidden -> invalid.
      ""POOBA"" -> not a word.

   So only ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" seem plausible.

   But we also have to check if they avoid forbidden letters.

   ""POOFS"": F is allowed, and no forbidden letters.
   ""POODS"": D is allowed, and no forbidden letters.

   But we don't have any information about F or D.

   However, we can use one of them.

   But note: we have to make a guess. Since we have two options, we can choose one.

   Alternatively, we can think if there is another word.

   What about ""POOIS""? Not a word.

   ""POOUB"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are the main options.

   But we also have to consider that in the feedback for ""ghost"", we had S marked as present but not at position 4. In ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"", S is at position 5, which is correct. And in ""POOFS"", the fourth letter is F, and in ""POODS"", it's D.

   We don't have any information about F or D.

   So we need to choose one.

   But note: we have not tested F or D in previous guesses. So we don't know.

   However, we can use a guess that includes both F and D? But we have to fit the pattern.

   But we are forced to choose one of the two.

   Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions: position 4 and the missing letter. Actually, we don't know the fourth letter, and we don't know if there are other letters.

   But we have to guess a word that is 5 letters and fits the pattern.

   Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one.

   But let's see the feedback we would get.

   If we guess ""POOFS"":
      P: correct (position 1)
      O: correct (position 2) and (position 3)
      O: correct (position 3) -> expected
      F: ? 
      S: correct (position 5)

   If the secret word is ""POOFS"", then F would be correct? But we don't know.

   Similarly, if we guess ""POODS"", then D would be tested.

   But we don't have to guess one of them. We can guess a word that tests other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

   However, we have two unknowns: the fourth letter and the fact that we don't know if there is a duplicate P? But we have P at position 1, and if the word has two P's, then in ""pools"" we had P at position 1 and no other P, so we don't know.

   But in ""pools"", we had P at position 1 and it was correct, but if the secret word has P at position 4, then in ""pools"" we didn't have a P at position 4, so we wouldn't know.

   But we can try to test with a word that has F or D.

   However, we are limited by the pattern P O O _ S.

   We can try ""POOFS"" or ""POODS"".

   But we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""POOFS"" because it's more common.

   However, we must avoid forbidden letters. ""POOFS"" has F, which is allowed.

   But if we guess ""POOFS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that F is absent? Then we know it must be ""POODS"".

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But we are almost there.

   However, we have only two possibilities, so we can guess one.

   But note: we have not tested F or D in previous guesses. So we don't have information.

   We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F or D.

   So I think we should guess ""POOFS"".

   But let me confirm the pattern: P O O _ S

   We are going to guess ""POOFS"": P O O F S

   If the secret word is ""POOFS"", then we win.

   If not, then it must be ""POODS"".

   But we have to make a guess. So I'll go with ""POOFS"".

   However, we must be cautious: is there a third possibility? For example, ""POOKS"" -> but K is allowed? But ""POOKS"" is a word? It's not common, but let's see. But we have O at position 3, and S at position 5. But ""POOKS"" has O at position 3? P O O K S -> position 3 is O? Yes. And K is allowed. So ""POOKS"" is a possibility? But we haven't tested K.

   But in the pattern, we have position 4: we can have K.

   So possible words: ""POOFS"", ""POODS"", ""POOKS"", and maybe others.

   But ""POOKS"" is not very common.

   ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are the main ones.

   Also, ""POUSY"" is not ending with S.

   ""POXES"" -> has E and X -> E is forbidden -> invalid.

   So I think we have two strong candidates.

   But we can also consider ""POMPS"" -> P O M P S -> but then position 4 is M and P? But we have two P's? And S at position 5. But ""POMPS"" is a word? It means something, but not common.

   ""PODOS"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are the two.

   Now, we can guess ""POOFS"".

   But let's see the feedback we would get if the secret word is ""POODS"":

      P: correct
      O: correct (position 2 and 3)
      O: correct (position 3)
      F: absent (because ""POODS"" has D at position 4, not F)
      S: correct

   Then we would know it's ""POODS"" for the next guess.

   Similarly, if we guess ""POODS"" and the secret word is ""POOFS"", then:
      P: correct
      O: correct
      O: correct
      D: absent (because ""POOFS"" has F at position 4)
      S: correct

   Then we know it's ""POOFS"".

   So we can use either guess to distinguish.

   But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 4, and we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.

   I think ""POOFS"" is more common.

   So I'll guess ""POOFS"".

   But note: we are also testing the letter F. If F is not in the word, then we know it must be ""POODS"".

   So let's do that.

   However, we must avoid forbidden letters. ""POOFS"" has F, which is allowed.

   So the guess is ""POOFS"".

   But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

   Is there a word like ""POOHS""? Not a word.

   ""POOKS"" is a word: P O O K S -> but then position 4 is K. And K is allowed.

   So ""POOKS"" is another candidate.

   But ""POOKS"" is less common.

   ""POOFS"" is more common.

   So I think ""POOFS"" is a good guess.

   But let me see if there is a word that tests more letters? For example, we could guess a word that has F and D? But we are constrained by the pattern P O O _ S. We cannot change the known letters.

   So we have to guess one of the candidates.

   I think ""POOFS"" is a good choice.

   So the next guess is ""POOFS"".

   But note: we are not sure if the secret word is ""POOFS"" or ""POODS"". But we are testing ""POOFS"".

   If it's not, then we know it must be ""POODS"" for the next guess.

   So let's do that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ghost** → 
   - O is correct and in position 3 (✓), so the word has O as the third letter: `_ _ O _ _`.
   - S is present but not in position 4 (-), so S is in the word but must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - G, H, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 3: pools** → 
   - P is correct and in position 1 (✓), so the word has P as the first letter: `P _ O _ _`.
   - The second O is correct (✓) at position 2, confirming O is also in position 2.
   - L is absent (x), so L is not in the word.
   - S is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the word ends with S.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is `P O O _ S`.
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L.
- S is confirmed at position 5, and O at positions 2 and 3.
- The missing letter (position 4) must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, O, S (since no duplicates are indicated yet).

### Analysis for Position 4:
- The only common 5-letter words fitting `P O O _ S` are:
  - **POOFS** (meaning a foolish act) → Fourth letter: F.
  - **POODS** (biological term for pods) → Fourth letter: D.
- Both avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L). F and D are untested letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Since there are only two likely candidates (`POOFS` and `POODS`), I'll guess **POOFS** to test F in position 4:
  - If correct, we solve the word.
  - If incorrect, we know it must be `POODS` for Guess 5.

   Alternatively, we can think of a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions: position 4 and the missing letter. Actually, we don't know the fourth letter, and we don't know if there are other letters.

   But we have to guess a word that is 5 letters and fits the pattern.

   Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one.

   But let's see the feedback we would get.

   If we guess ""POOFS"":
      P: correct (position 1)
      O: correct (position 2) and (position 3)
      O: correct (position 3) -> expected
      F: ? 
      S: correct (position 5)

   If the secret word is ""POOFS"", then F would be correct? But we don't know.

   Similarly, if we guess ""POODS"", then D would be tested.

   But we don't have to guess one of them. We can guess a word that tests other letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

   However, we have two unknowns: the fourth letter and the fact that we don't know if there is a duplicate P? But we have P at position 1, and if the word has two P's, then in ""pools"" we had P at position 1 and no other P, so we don't know.

   But in ""pools"", we had P at position 1 and it was correct, but if the secret word has P at position 4, then in ""pools"" we didn't have a P at position 4, so we wouldn't know.

   But we can try to test with a word that has F or D.

   However, we are limited by the pattern P O O _ S.

   We can try ""POOFS"" or ""POODS"".

   But we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""POOFS"" because it's more common.

   However, we must avoid forbidden letters. ""POOFS"" has F, which is allowed.

   But if we guess ""POOFS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback that F is absent? Then we know it must be ""POODS"".

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily a candidate but tests more letters? But we are almost there.

   However, we have only two possibilities, so we can guess one.

   But note: we have not tested F or D in previous guesses. So we don't have information.

   We can also consider that in the first guess, we had no F or D.

   So I think we should guess ""POOFS"".

   But let me confirm the pattern: P O O _ S

   We are going to guess ""POOFS"": P O O F S

   If the secret word is ""POOFS"", then we win.

   If not, then it must be ""POODS"".

   But we have to make a guess. So I'll go with ""POOFS"".

   However, we must be cautious: is there a third possibility? For example, ""POOKS"" -> but K is allowed? But ""POOKS"" is a word? It's not common, but let's see. But we have O at position 3, and S at position 5. But ""POOKS"" has O at position 3? P O O K S -> position 3 is O? Yes. And K is allowed. So ""POOKS"" is a possibility? But we haven't tested K.

   But in the pattern, we have position 4: we can have K.

   So possible words: ""POOFS"", ""POODS"", ""POOKS"", and maybe others.

   But ""POOKS"" is not very common.

   ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are the main ones.

   Also, ""POUSY"" is not ending with S.

   ""POXES"" -> has E and X -> E is forbidden -> invalid.

   So I think we have two strong candidates.

   But we can also consider ""POMPS"" -> P O M P S -> but then position 4 is M and P? But we have two P's? And S at position 5. But ""POMPS"" is a word? It means something, but not common.

   ""PODOS"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""POOFS"" and ""POODS"" are the two.

   Now, we can guess ""POOFS"".

   But let's see the feedback we would get if the secret word is ""POODS"":

      P: correct
      O: correct (position 2 and 3)
      O: correct (position 3)
      F: absent (because ""POODS"" has D at position 4, not F)
      S: correct

   Then we would know it's ""POODS"" for the next guess.

   Similarly, if we guess ""POODS"" and the secret word is ""POOFS"", then:
      P: correct
      O: correct
      O: correct
      D: absent (because ""POOFS"" has F at position 4)
      S: correct

   Then we know it's ""POOFS"".

   So we can use either guess to distinguish.

   But we have two guesses left? We are on guess 4, and we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one of them.

   I think ""POOFS"" is more common.

   So I'll guess ""POOFS"".

   But note: we are also testing the letter F. If F is not in the word, then we know it must be ""POODS"".

   So let's do that.

   However, we must avoid forbidden letters. ""POOFS"" has F, which is allowed.

   So the guess is ""POOFS"".

   But wait, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

   Is there a word like ""POOHS""? Not a word.

   ""POOKS"" is a word: P O O K S -> but then position 4 is K. And K is allowed.

   So ""POOKS"" is another candidate.

   But ""POOKS"" is less common.

   ""POOFS"" is more common.

   So I think ""POOFS"" is a good guess.

   But let me see if there is a word that tests more letters? For example, we could guess a word that has F and D? But we are constrained by the pattern P O O _ S. We cannot change the known letters.

   So we have to guess one of the candidates.

   I think ""POOFS"" is a good choice.

   So the next guess is ""POOFS"".

   But note: we are not sure if the secret word is ""POOFS"" or ""POODS"". But we are testing ""POOFS"".

   If it's not, then we know it must be ""POODS"" for the next guess.

   So let's do that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 2: ghost** → 
   - O is correct and in position 3 (✓), so the word has O as the third letter: `_ _ O _ _`.
   - S is present but not in position 4 (-), so S is in the word but must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
   - G, H, T are absent (x), so they are not in the word.
- **Guess 3: pools** → 
   - P is correct and in position 1 (✓), so the word has P as the first letter: `P _ O _ _`.
   - The second O is correct (✓) at position 2, confirming O is also in position 2.
   - L is absent (x), so L is not in the word.
   - S is correct and in position 5 (✓), so the word ends with S.

### Deductions:
- The secret word pattern is `P O O _ S`.
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L.
- S is confirmed at position 5, and O at positions 2 and 3.
- The missing letter (position 4) must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, O, S (since no duplicates are indicated yet).

### Analysis for Position 4:
- The only common 5-letter words fitting `P O O _ S` are:
  - **POOFS** (meaning a foolish act) → Fourth letter: F.
  - **POODS** (biological term for pods) → Fourth letter: D.
- Both avoid forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, G, H, T, L). F and D are untested letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Since there are only two likely candidates (`POOFS` and `POODS`), I'll guess **POOFS** to test F in position 4:
  - If correct, we solve the word.
  - If incorrect, we know it must be `POODS` for Guess 5.",Guess 4: poofs -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) O(✓) F(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
