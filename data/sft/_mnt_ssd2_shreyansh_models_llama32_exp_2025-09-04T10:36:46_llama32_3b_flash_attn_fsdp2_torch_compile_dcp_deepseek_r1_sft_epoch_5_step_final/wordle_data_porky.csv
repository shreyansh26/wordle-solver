We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word must have R. Let's try to put R in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that we don't know if R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried yet.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and some of these new letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. Or ""ROUST"" (which is a word: to drive out or to disturb).

 But note: we must use valid English words.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" (a sprit is a small sail) but that has S, P, R, I, T. However, we don't know if S, P, I, T are in the word.

 But we have to avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROUST"" (R in position 1) -> R, O, U, S, T. This is a valid word.
 - ""TRIOS"" (T in position 1, R in position 3) -> T, R, I, O, S. But note that we don't know if T, I, O, S are in the word.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but that has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

 But wait: in ""crane"", we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R in position 4 or 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""ROUST"": R (position 1), O, U, S, T -> tests O, U, S, T (and R in a new position)
 - ""TRIPS"": T, R (position 2), I, P, S -> but position 2 was already tried for R and it was wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: 
   R _ _ _ _

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

 Examples: 
   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don't know about B and T. But note: we have two O's? We don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but let's see if we can get more common letters.

   ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S -> tests O, I, L, S.

   ""ROUST"" as I thought earlier: R, O, U, S, T.

   ""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> tests O, W, D, Y.

   ""RUSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And we don't know if S is in the word.

   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.

   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.

 So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don't know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.

 But we also want to test R in a position that we haven't tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don't have much to go on.

 Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it's correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.

 But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.

 How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.

 So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That's good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don't know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).

 But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is in the word. We are testing P.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.

 So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.

 I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).

 So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.

 After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).

 So let's go with ""ROUST"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.
- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **""ROUST""** because:
- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word must have R. Let's try to put R in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that we don't know if R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried yet.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and some of these new letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. Or ""ROUST"" (which is a word: to drive out or to disturb).

 But note: we must use valid English words.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" (a sprit is a small sail) but that has S, P, R, I, T. However, we don't know if S, P, I, T are in the word.

 But we have to avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROUST"" (R in position 1) -> R, O, U, S, T. This is a valid word.
 - ""TRIOS"" (T in position 1, R in position 3) -> T, R, I, O, S. But note that we don't know if T, I, O, S are in the word.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but that has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

 But wait: in ""crane"", we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R in position 4 or 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""ROUST"": R (position 1), O, U, S, T -> tests O, U, S, T (and R in a new position)
 - ""TRIPS"": T, R (position 2), I, P, S -> but position 2 was already tried for R and it was wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: 
   R _ _ _ _

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

 Examples: 
   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don't know about B and T. But note: we have two O's? We don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but let's see if we can get more common letters.

   ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S -> tests O, I, L, S.

   ""ROUST"" as I thought earlier: R, O, U, S, T.

   ""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> tests O, W, D, Y.

   ""RUSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And we don't know if S is in the word.

   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.

   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.

 So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don't know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.

 But we also want to test R in a position that we haven't tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don't have much to go on.

 Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it's correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.

 But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.

 How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.

 So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That's good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don't know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).

 But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is in the word. We are testing P.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.

 So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.

 I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).

 So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.

 After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).

 So let's go with ""ROUST"".

<guess>roust</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.
- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **""ROUST""** because:
- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T

We also know that R is in the word, but it's not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the following constraints:
- Position 2 is O.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 (since we know it's correct).
- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).
- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.
- If we put R in position 4, we test that.
- If we put R in position 5, we test that.

But note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We also know that position 1 is open and we haven't tested many letters for position 1.

Let's think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.

For example:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _
- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.
  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.
  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: 
  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.
  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.
  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.

We need to avoid E. So words with E are out.

What about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: 
- D: not tested
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.

But we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _

For example: 
  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.
  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.

What about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R
- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.
- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

Also hard.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. 

What about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Let me think of words: 
- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.
- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.

But we also want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.

Another candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Actually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.

We need the second letter to be O.

Let me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)

Common words:
- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.
- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.
- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.
- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.
- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

Another: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.

We must avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.

But note: we are also testing M, P, H.

Another word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

But ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

Another: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

But we don't know if F, B, Y are in the word.

We can also consider R in position 4: 
- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)
- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.
- ""GORED"" -> E absent.
- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.

It's difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.

""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

We need O in position 2.

Another idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.

""DOZEN"" -> invalid.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit R.

We must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.

So, let's focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words:
- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.

""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.

""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""JOKER"" same.

""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

So, let's try ""MORPH"": 
- M: new
- O: correct (we know)
- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)
- P: new
- H: new

This tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M.

Another option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.

We can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.

For example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.

""COMER"" invalid.

""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.

""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.

""HOYER"" -> not common.

""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> invalid.

""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.

So, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""MORPH"" for now.

But note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven't tested position 4.

Another word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.

""GORMY"" -> not common.

""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.

""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.

So, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

But wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

Similarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

We can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.

""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.

""BORED"" invalid.

So, let's choose ""MORPH"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.

We are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.

If we get feedback that R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in 4 or 5.

So, I'll go with ""MORPH"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??.

""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching.

We need the second letter to be O.

So, ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: not tested -> good.
- O: correct -> we know.
- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.
- P: not tested -> good.
- H: not tested -> good.

And no absent letters.

So, I'll guess ""MORPH"".

But wait, what about ""FORBY""? It's also valid and tests F, B, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are trying to test R's position.

""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

So, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

Similarly, P and H.

So, let's do it.

<guess>morph</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct and in position 2. U, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **O is fixed in position 2**.
- **R is in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T. We must avoid these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R/O are confirmed present).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include O in position 2** and **R in position 3, 4, or 5** (to test its location).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., M, P, H) to gather more information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions that are already ruled out for R.

I chose **""MORPH""** because:
- It places O in position 2 (correct, as confirmed).
- It tests R in position 3 (a new position to check).
- It introduces three new common letters: M (position 1), P (position 4), and H (position 5).
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if R is in position 3 (if ✓, we lock in position 3; if -, we know R is in 4/5).
- Reveal if M, P, or H are in the word and their positions.

<guess>morph</guess>",morph,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T

We also know that R is in the word, but it's not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the following constraints:
- Position 2 is O.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 (since we know it's correct).
- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).
- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.
- If we put R in position 4, we test that.
- If we put R in position 5, we test that.

But note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We also know that position 1 is open and we haven't tested many letters for position 1.

Let's think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.

For example:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _
- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.
  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.
  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: 
  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.
  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.
  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.

We need to avoid E. So words with E are out.

What about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: 
- D: not tested
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.

But we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _

For example: 
  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.
  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.

What about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R
- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.
- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

Also hard.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. 

What about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Let me think of words: 
- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.
- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.

But we also want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.

Another candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Actually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.

We need the second letter to be O.

Let me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)

Common words:
- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.
- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.
- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.
- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.
- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

Another: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.

We must avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.

But note: we are also testing M, P, H.

Another word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

But ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

Another: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

But we don't know if F, B, Y are in the word.

We can also consider R in position 4: 
- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)
- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.
- ""GORED"" -> E absent.
- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.

It's difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.

""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

We need O in position 2.

Another idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.

""DOZEN"" -> invalid.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit R.

We must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.

So, let's focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words:
- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.

""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.

""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""JOKER"" same.

""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

So, let's try ""MORPH"": 
- M: new
- O: correct (we know)
- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)
- P: new
- H: new

This tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M.

Another option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.

We can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.

For example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.

""COMER"" invalid.

""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.

""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.

""HOYER"" -> not common.

""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> invalid.

""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.

So, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""MORPH"" for now.

But note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven't tested position 4.

Another word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.

""GORMY"" -> not common.

""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.

""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.

So, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

But wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

Similarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

We can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.

""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.

""BORED"" invalid.

So, let's choose ""MORPH"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.

We are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: not tested -> good.
- O: correct -> we know.
- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.
- P: not tested -> good.
- H: not tested -> good.

And no absent letters.

So, I'll guess ""MORPH"".

But wait, what about ""FORBY""? It's also valid and tests F, B, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are trying to test R's position.

""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

So, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word must have R. Let's try to put R in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that we don't know if R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried yet.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and some of these new letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. Or ""ROUST"" (which is a word: to drive out or to disturb).

 But note: we must use valid English words.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" (a sprit is a small sail) but that has S, P, R, I, T. However, we don't know if S, P, I, T are in the word.

 But we have to avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROUST"" (R in position 1) -> R, O, U, S, T. This is a valid word.
 - ""TRIOS"" (T in position 1, R in position 3) -> T, R, I, O, S. But note that we don't know if T, I, O, S are in the word.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but that has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

 But wait: in ""crane"", we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R in position 4 or 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""ROUST"": R (position 1), O, U, S, T -> tests O, U, S, T (and R in a new position)
 - ""TRIPS"": T, R (position 2), I, P, S -> but position 2 was already tried for R and it was wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: 
   R _ _ _ _

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

 Examples: 
   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don't know about B and T. But note: we have two O's? We don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but let's see if we can get more common letters.

   ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S -> tests O, I, L, S.

   ""ROUST"" as I thought earlier: R, O, U, S, T.

   ""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> tests O, W, D, Y.

   ""RUSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And we don't know if S is in the word.

   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.

   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.

 So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don't know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.

 But we also want to test R in a position that we haven't tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don't have much to go on.

 Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it's correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.

 But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.

 How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.

 So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That's good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don't know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).

 But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is in the word. We are testing P.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.

 So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.

 I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).

 So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.

 After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).

 So let's go with ""ROUST"".

<guess>roust</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.
- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **""ROUST""** because:
- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.

<guess>roust</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T

We also know that R is in the word, but it's not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the following constraints:
- Position 2 is O.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 (since we know it's correct).
- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).
- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.
- If we put R in position 4, we test that.
- If we put R in position 5, we test that.

But note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We also know that position 1 is open and we haven't tested many letters for position 1.

Let's think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.

For example:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _
- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.
  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.
  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: 
  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.
  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.
  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.

We need to avoid E. So words with E are out.

What about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: 
- D: not tested
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.

But we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _

For example: 
  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.
  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.

What about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R
- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.
- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

Also hard.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. 

What about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Let me think of words: 
- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.
- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.

But we also want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.

Another candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Actually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.

We need the second letter to be O.

Let me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)

Common words:
- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.
- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.
- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.
- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.
- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

Another: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.

We must avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.

But note: we are also testing M, P, H.

Another word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

But ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

Another: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

But we don't know if F, B, Y are in the word.

We can also consider R in position 4: 
- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)
- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.
- ""GORED"" -> E absent.
- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.

It's difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.

""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

We need O in position 2.

Another idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.

""DOZEN"" -> invalid.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit R.

We must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.

So, let's focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words:
- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.

""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.

""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""JOKER"" same.

""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

So, let's try ""MORPH"": 
- M: new
- O: correct (we know)
- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)
- P: new
- H: new

This tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M.

Another option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.

We can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.

For example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.

""COMER"" invalid.

""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.

""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.

""HOYER"" -> not common.

""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> invalid.

""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.

So, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""MORPH"" for now.

But note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven't tested position 4.

Another word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.

""GORMY"" -> not common.

""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.

""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.

So, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

But wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

Similarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

We can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.

""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.

""BORED"" invalid.

So, let's choose ""MORPH"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.

We are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.

If we get feedback that R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in 4 or 5.

So, I'll go with ""MORPH"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??.

""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching.

We need the second letter to be O.

So, ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: not tested -> good.
- O: correct -> we know.
- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.
- P: not tested -> good.
- H: not tested -> good.

And no absent letters.

So, I'll guess ""MORPH"".

But wait, what about ""FORBY""? It's also valid and tests F, B, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are trying to test R's position.

""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

So, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

Similarly, P and H.

So, let's do it.

<guess>morph</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct and in position 2. U, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **O is fixed in position 2**.
- **R is in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T. We must avoid these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R/O are confirmed present).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include O in position 2** and **R in position 3, 4, or 5** (to test its location).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., M, P, H) to gather more information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions that are already ruled out for R.

I chose **""MORPH""** because:
- It places O in position 2 (correct, as confirmed).
- It tests R in position 3 (a new position to check).
- It introduces three new common letters: M (position 1), P (position 4), and H (position 5).
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if R is in position 3 (if ✓, we lock in position 3; if -, we know R is in 4/5).
- Reveal if M, P, or H are in the word and their positions.

Choose a word that includes R (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).\n 2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.\n\n Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We know the word must have R. Let\'s try to put R in a different position.\n\n Since in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, note that we don\'t know if R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried yet.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes R and some of these new letters.\n\n Example: We could try ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. Or ""ROUST"" (which is a word: to drive out or to disturb).\n\n But note: we must use valid English words.\n\n Another idea: ""SPRIT"" (a sprit is a small sail) but that has S, P, R, I, T. However, we don\'t know if S, P, I, T are in the word.\n\n But we have to avoid A, C, N, E.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and use common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters.\n\n Possibilities: \n - ""ROUST"" (R in position 1) -> R, O, U, S, T. This is a valid word.\n - ""TRIOS"" (T in position 1, R in position 3) -> T, R, I, O, S. But note that we don\'t know if T, I, O, S are in the word.\n\n However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but that has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn\'t have any of those.\n\n But wait: in ""crane"", we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R in position 4 or 5? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\n Let me list some words:\n - ""ROUST"": R (position 1), O, U, S, T -> tests O, U, S, T (and R in a new position)\n - ""TRIPS"": T, R (position 2), I, P, S -> but position 2 was already tried for R and it was wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it\'s not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: \n   R _ _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.\n\n Examples: \n   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don\'t know about B and T. But note: we have two O\'s? We don\'t know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it\'s valid, but let\'s see if we can get more common letters.\n\n   ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S -> tests O, I, L, S.\n\n   ""ROUST"" as I thought earlier: R, O, U, S, T.\n\n   ""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> tests O, W, D, Y.\n\n   ""RUSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.\n\n   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.\n\n So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don\'t know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.\n\n But we also want to test R in a position that we haven\'t tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don\'t have much to go on.\n\n Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it\'s correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.\n\n But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.\n\n Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.\n\n How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.\n\n So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That\'s good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don\'t know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).\n\n But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.\n\n But we don\'t know if P is in the word. We are testing P.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.\n\n How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.\n\n So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, I, L, S are in the word.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).\n\n So I\'ll go with ""ROUST"".\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.\n\n But we don\'t know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.\n\n After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ROUST"".\n\n<guess>roust</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.\n- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **""ROUST""** because:\n- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.\n\n<guess>roust</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""roust""\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got \'-\' for R in position 1]\n- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T\n\nWe also know that R is in the word, but it\'s not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, the secret word has the following constraints:\n- Position 2 is O.\n- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.\n- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Has O in position 2 (since we know it\'s correct).\n- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).\n- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R:\n- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.\n- If we put R in position 4, we test that.\n- If we put R in position 5, we test that.\n\nBut note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nWe also know that position 1 is open and we haven\'t tested many letters for position 1.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _\n- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _\n- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.\n  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: \n  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.\n  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.\n  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.\n  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid E. So words with E are out.\n\nWhat about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: \n- D: not tested\n- O: in position 2 (correct)\n- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.\n\nBut we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _\n\nFor example: \n  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.\n  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.\n  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R\n- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.\n- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.\n- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\nAlso hard.\n\nAlternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. \n\nWhat about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.\n\nWe must have O in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.\n\n""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.\n- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.\n\nBut we also want to test other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??\n\nActually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.\n\nWe need the second letter to be O.\n\nLet me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)\n\nCommon words:\n- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.\n- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.\n- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.\n- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.\n- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.\n\nAnother: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.\n\nWe must avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo, let\'s try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.\n\nBut note: we are also testing M, P, H.\n\nAnother word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.\n\nAnother: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if F, B, Y are in the word.\n\nWe can also consider R in position 4: \n- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)\n- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.\n- ""GORED"" -> E absent.\n- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.\n\nIt\'s difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.\n\n""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.\n\nWe need O in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> invalid.\n\n""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit R.\n\nWe must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.\n\nSo, let\'s focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon words:\n- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.\n\n""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.\n\n""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.\n\n""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""JOKER"" same.\n\n""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""MORPH"": \n- M: new\n- O: correct (we know)\n- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)\n- P: new\n- H: new\n\nThis tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.\n\nBut note: we are also testing position 1 with M.\n\nAnother option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.\n\nWe can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.\n\nFor example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""COMER"" invalid.\n\n""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""HOYER"" -> not common.\n\n""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POKER"" -> invalid.\n\n""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.\n\nSo, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""MORPH"" for now.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven\'t tested position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.\n\n""GORMY"" -> not common.\n\n""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.\n\n""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.\n\nSo, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.\n\nWe can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.\n\n""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.\n\n""BORED"" invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""MORPH"".\n\nBut note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""MORPH"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??.\n\n""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching.\n\nWe need the second letter to be O.\n\nSo, ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. \n- M: not tested -> good.\n- O: correct -> we know.\n- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.\n- P: not tested -> good.\n- H: not tested -> good.\n\nAnd no absent letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""MORPH"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""FORBY""? It\'s also valid and tests F, B, Y.\n\nBut ""MORPH"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.\n\n""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two O\'s? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.\n\nBut we are trying to test R\'s position.\n\n""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.\n\nWe must have O in position 2.\n\nSo, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, P and H.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>morph</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.\n- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct and in position 2. U, S, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **O is fixed in position 2**.\n- **R is in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T. We must avoid these.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R/O are confirmed present).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Must include O in position 2** and **R in position 3, 4, or 5** (to test its location).\n- **Test new common letters** (e.g., M, P, H) to gather more information.\n- **Avoid absent letters** and positions that are already ruled out for R.\n\nI chose **""MORPH""** because:\n- It places O in position 2 (correct, as confirmed).\n- It tests R in position 3 (a new position to check).\n- It introduces three new common letters: M (position 1), P (position 4), and H (position 5).\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T).\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if R is in position 3 (if ✓, we lock in position 3; if -, we know R is in 4/5).\n- Reveal if M, P, or H are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>morph</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: morph -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) R(✓) P(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

- R is in position 3 (from guess3: R✓ in position 3).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O R _ _

Also, we know:
- The first letter is unknown, but not C, A, N, E, M, U, S, T, H (from the x's).
- The fourth and fifth letters are unknown, but not P (since P is in the word but not in position 4) and also not the absent letters.

Present letters:
- R is in position 3 (fixed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- P is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""morph"" feedback: P- in position 4).

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H

We also know that from ""crane"", R was not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 3.

So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] [letter5]

We know P is in the word, but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1 or 5? But position 1 is open, and position 5 is open. However, P could also be in position 1 or 5? But we don't know yet. The feedback for ""morph"" says P is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by O and R).

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 2 is O and position 3 is R. So P must be in position 1 or 5? Or could it be in position 4? But the feedback says it's not in position 4, so only position 1 or 5.

Also, we have to consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't seen any.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 and R in position 3 (since they are confirmed).
- Includes P (because we know it's in the word) but not in position 4 (and not in position 3 because that's R). So P must be in position 1 or 5.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.

So the word pattern: [1] O R [4] [5]

And P is in one of the unknown positions: 1 or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are other letters that might be in the word.

We also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 4, and 5? Actually, three positions: 1, 4, and 5. But we know one of them must be P? Not necessarily, because P might be in one of them, but we also have to consider that there might be another letter.

But we know P is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

The other two positions (if P is in 1, then positions 4 and 5 are open; if P is in 5, then positions 1 and 4 are open) could be any letters from the available set.

Available letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O, R, P are in the word, but O and R are fixed).

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we must include it in the guess, but in a position that is not 4 (since it can't be in 4). So we must put P in position 1 or 5.

We also need to test the remaining positions.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: P is in position 1 -> then the word is P O R [4] [5]
Case 2: P is in position 5 -> then the word is [1] O R [4] P

We need to choose a word that can help distinguish between these cases and also test the fourth and fifth positions.

But note: we have to use a valid English word.

We can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has P in position 1 or 5 and tests new letters for the other positions.

However, we also need to test the fourth position.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and include P in position 1 or 5.

First, if P is in position 1: then the word is P O R ? ?

We need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not absent and form a word.

Possible words: 
- ""PORCH"" -> but C and H are absent.
- ""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.
- ""PORGY"" -> G and Y: P, O, R, G, Y -> avoids absent letters? G and Y are available. So ""PORGY"" is a word? It means fatty or related to pork, but might be accepted. However, let's see if there are better options.

But we don't know if G and Y are in the word.

Alternatively, ""PORGY"" has P in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.

But we are testing P in position 1. If we get a check for P, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then P must be in position 5.

But we also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

Another word: ""PORED"" -> P, O, R, E, D -> but E is absent (from guess1), invalid.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A absent.

""PORGY"" might be acceptable, but let's see if there's a better one.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2 and R in position 3. ""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching. We need O in 2 and R in 3.

So, for the pattern P O R ? ?, we need a word like ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is one.

Another: ""PORBS"" -> not a word? ""PORB"" is not 5 letters.

""PORGY"" is 5 letters and valid? Yes, meaning obese or related to pork. It's in the dictionary.

But we can also try without P in position 1? But we are considering that.

Alternatively, if P is in position 5: then the word is ? O R ? P

For example: ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> but we don't have P? We need to include P because we know it's in the word. So we must include P.

So, for the pattern ? O R ? P, we need a word with P at the end.

Examples: 
- ""FORUP"" -> not a word.
- ""JUMPS"" -> S absent and no P? We need P at the end.

""WORDY"" doesn't have P.

""FORGY"" -> F, O, R, G, Y -> but no P? We need to include P? Actually, we know P is in the word, so we must include it.

So, for the pattern with P in position 5: we need a word like [letter] O R [letter] P

What words are there? 
- ""TROP"" is 4 letters.
- ""CROPP"" -> C absent, and not 5 letters? ""CROP"" is 4.

5-letter words: 
- ""CROPP"" is 5 but C absent.
- ""WORPP"" -> not a word.

Actually, it's hard. Let me think.

""FORIPP"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""GORPP"" -> not a word.

This might be difficult. Maybe P is not in position 5? We have to consider both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 1 and then test other letters for the fourth and fifth.

But we also need to test if the fourth and fifth are filled with available letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.

But we need a valid word.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and include P.

First, with P in position 1: ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is the only common one I can think of. But let's check if there are others.

""PORCH"" -> C and H absent.

""PORKS"" -> S absent.

""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.

""PORGY"" is one.

Now, with P in position 5: 
- ""BORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""DORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""FURPP"" -> not a word.
- ""KORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""LORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""MORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""PORPP"" -> not a word.

What about ""FORP"" is 4 letters? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with P at the end and O in the middle and R at the beginning? The pattern is ? O R ? P.

For example, ""AORAP"" -> not a word and A absent.

""EORPP"" -> not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe P is in position 1.

So, let's assume P is in position 1 for now, and we can test ""PORGY"".

But we also need to test the fourth and fifth letters. In ""PORGY"", we are testing G in position 4 and Y in position 5.

If we guess ""PORGY"", then:
- If P is in position 1, we get a check for P.
- If not, then P must be in position 5, and we will get a '-' for P in position 1? But we know P is in the word, so if we put P in position 1 and it's actually in position 5, we get a '-' for P in position 1? And then we know P is in position 5.

But we also get feedback for G and Y.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.

But as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

Another word: ""FORUM"" -> but U is absent.

""GORGE"" -> E absent.

""YORKE"" -> Y, O, R, K, E -> E absent.

So, ""PORGY"" seems a reasonable choice, even if it's uncommon.

But let's see if there's a more common word.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No.

We must have O in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another word: ""PROBE"" -> P, R, O, B, E -> E absent.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMO"" -> P, R, O, M, O -> M absent (from guess3) and O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMY"" -> not a word.

""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3? Not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and includes P.

But let's confirm: ""PORGY"" is 5 letters: P-O-R-G-Y.

And it avoids the absent letters: no C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But note: we are also testing G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If P is in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know P must be in position 5.
- We also get feedback for G and Y.

But we have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two P's? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

But in ""PORGY"", we are using P only once.

We can also consider that the fourth and fifth positions might be filled with other letters.

But we have to include P in the guess because we know it's in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have P in position 1 or 5? But we must include P because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we can't avoid P.

Another word: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> but we don't have P? We must include P because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit P.

We must include P in the guess.

So, let's go with ""PORGY"".

But note: we are putting P in position 1. If P is actually in position 5, then we will get a '-' for P in position 1 and then we know P is in position 5.

We also test G in position 4 and Y in position 5.

If we get a check for P, then we know P is in position 1.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But is ""PORGY"" a valid word? It's in the dictionary as an adjective meaning having a pig-like appearance or features.

We can also consider ""PROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the best option.

But let's see if there's a word with P in position 5.

For example, ""BORPP"" not a word.

""WORDY"" no P.

""FORPY"" -> not a word.

""GORPY"" -> not a word.

""YORPP"" -> not a word.

So, I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""PORGY"".

But note: we are also testing G and Y. If they are in the word, we get feedback.

So, let's do it.

<guess>porgy</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2. 
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct in position 2. U, S, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""morph"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is present but not in position 4. H is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 2: **O**
  - Position 3: **R**
- **Present letters**: O, R, P (with P not in position 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.
- **Word structure**: `[1] O R [4] [5]`
- **P must be in position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test P in position 1 or 5** to resolve its location.
- **Test new common letters** for positions 4 and 5 (e.g., G, Y, L, D, F).
- **Avoid absent letters** and ruled-out positions for P.

I chose **""PORGY""** because:
- It places **O in position 2** and **R in position 3** (confirmed).
- It tests **P in position 1** (to check if P is in position 1 or 5).
- It introduces **G** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if P is in position 1 (if ✓, P is locked in position 1; if -, P must be in position 5).
- Reveal if G or Y are in the word and their positions.

<guess>porgy</guess>",porgy,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""morph""
- M: x (not in word)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [This is new! R is in position 3]
- P: - (in word, but not in position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in position 2 (from guess2 and guess3).
- R is in position 3 (from guess3: R✓ in position 3).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O R _ _

Also, we know:
- The first letter is unknown, but not C, A, N, E, M, U, S, T, H (from the x's).
- The fourth and fifth letters are unknown, but not P (since P is in the word but not in position 4) and also not the absent letters.

Present letters:
- R is in position 3 (fixed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- P is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""morph"" feedback: P- in position 4).

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H

We also know that from ""crane"", R was not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 3.

So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] [letter5]

We know P is in the word, but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1 or 5? But position 1 is open, and position 5 is open. However, P could also be in position 1 or 5? But we don't know yet. The feedback for ""morph"" says P is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by O and R).

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 2 is O and position 3 is R. So P must be in position 1 or 5? Or could it be in position 4? But the feedback says it's not in position 4, so only position 1 or 5.

Also, we have to consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't seen any.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 and R in position 3 (since they are confirmed).
- Includes P (because we know it's in the word) but not in position 4 (and not in position 3 because that's R). So P must be in position 1 or 5.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.

So the word pattern: [1] O R [4] [5]

And P is in one of the unknown positions: 1 or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are other letters that might be in the word.

We also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 4, and 5? Actually, three positions: 1, 4, and 5. But we know one of them must be P? Not necessarily, because P might be in one of them, but we also have to consider that there might be another letter.

But we know P is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

The other two positions (if P is in 1, then positions 4 and 5 are open; if P is in 5, then positions 1 and 4 are open) could be any letters from the available set.

Available letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O, R, P are in the word, but O and R are fixed).

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we must include it in the guess, but in a position that is not 4 (since it can't be in 4). So we must put P in position 1 or 5.

We also need to test the remaining positions.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: P is in position 1 -> then the word is P O R [4] [5]
Case 2: P is in position 5 -> then the word is [1] O R [4] P

We need to choose a word that can help distinguish between these cases and also test the fourth and fifth positions.

But note: we have to use a valid English word.

We can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has P in position 1 or 5 and tests new letters for the other positions.

But we are testing P in position 1. If we get a check for P, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then P must be in position 5.

But we also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

Another word: ""PORED"" -> P, O, R, E, D -> but E is absent (from guess1), invalid.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A absent.

""PORGY"" might be acceptable, but let's see if there's a better one.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2 and R in position 3. ""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching. We need O in 2 and R in 3.

So, for the pattern P O R ? ?, we need a word like ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is one.

Another: ""PORBS"" -> not a word? ""PORB"" is not 5 letters.

""PORGY"" is 5 letters and valid? Yes, meaning obese or related to pork. It's in the dictionary.

But we can also try without P in position 1? But we are considering that.

Alternatively, if P is in position 5: then the word is ? O R ? P

For example: ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> but we don't have P? We need to include P because we know it's in the word. So we must include P.

So, for the pattern ? O R ? P, we need a word with P at the end.

Examples: 
- ""FORUP"" -> not a word.
- ""JUMPS"" -> S absent and no P? We need P at the end.

""WORDY"" doesn't have P.

""FORGY"" -> F, O, R, G, Y -> but no P? We need to include P? Actually, we know P is in the word, so we must include it.

So, for the pattern with P in position 5: we need a word like [letter] O R [letter] P

What words are there? 
- ""TROP"" is 4 letters.
- ""CROPP"" -> C absent, and not 5 letters? ""CROP"" is 4.

5-letter words: 
- ""CROPP"" is 5 but C absent.
- ""WORPP"" -> not a word.

Actually, it's hard. Let me think.

""FORIPP"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""GORPP"" -> not a word.

This might be difficult. Maybe P is not in position 5? We have to consider both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 1 and then test other letters for the fourth and fifth.

But we also need to test if the fourth and fifth are filled with available letters.

- ""DORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""FURPP"" -> not a word.
- ""KORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""LORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""MORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""PORPP"" -> not a word.

What about ""FORP"" is 4 letters? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with P at the end and O in the middle and R at the beginning? The pattern is ? O R ? P.

For example, ""AORAP"" -> not a word and A absent.

""EORPP"" -> not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe P is in position 1.

So, let's assume P is in position 1 for now, and we can test ""PORGY"".

Another word: ""FORUM"" -> but U is absent.

""GORGE"" -> E absent.

""YORKE"" -> Y, O, R, K, E -> E absent.

So, ""PORGY"" seems a reasonable choice, even if it's uncommon.

But let's see if there's a more common word.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No.

We must have O in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another word: ""PROBE"" -> P, R, O, B, E -> E absent.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMO"" -> P, R, O, M, O -> M absent (from guess3) and O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMY"" -> not a word.

""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3? Not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and includes P.

But let's confirm: ""PORGY"" is 5 letters: P-O-R-G-Y.

And it avoids the absent letters: no C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But note: we are also testing G and Y.

We must include P in the guess.

But note: we are putting P in position 1. If P is actually in position 5, then we will get a '-' for P in position 1 and then we know P is in position 5.

We also test G in position 4 and Y in position 5.

If we get a check for P, then we know P is in position 1.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But is ""PORGY"" a valid word? It's in the dictionary as an adjective meaning having a pig-like appearance or features.

We can also consider ""PROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the best option.

- **Test P in position 1 or 5** to resolve its location.
- **Test new common letters** for positions 4 and 5 (e.g., G, Y, L, D, F).
- **Avoid absent letters** and ruled-out positions for P.

I chose **""PORGY""** because:
- It places **O in position 2** and **R in position 3** (confirmed).
- It tests **P in position 1** (to check if P is in position 1 or 5).
- It introduces **G** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if P is in position 1 (if ✓, P is locked in position 1; if -, P must be in position 5).
- Reveal if G or Y are in the word and their positions.",Guess 4: porgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
 2. Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.

 Also, we want to cover new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word must have R. Let's try to put R in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" R was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, note that we don't know if R can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. We should try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried yet.

 Also, we want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to form a word that includes R and some of these new letters.

 Example: We could try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. Or ""ROUST"" (which is a word: to drive out or to disturb).

 But note: we must use valid English words.

 Another idea: ""SPRIT"" (a sprit is a small sail) but that has S, P, R, I, T. However, we don't know if S, P, I, T are in the word.

 But we have to avoid A, C, N, E.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried.

 We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

 Possibilities: 
 - ""ROUST"" (R in position 1) -> R, O, U, S, T. This is a valid word.
 - ""TRIOS"" (T in position 1, R in position 3) -> T, R, I, O, S. But note that we don't know if T, I, O, S are in the word.

 However, we want to maximize information. We might want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another common starting word is ""SPORT"", but that has S, P, O, R, T. However, we know R is in the word, so we can try that? But note: we have to avoid A, C, N, E. ""SPORT"" doesn't have any of those.

 But wait: in ""crane"", we had R in position 2 and it was wrong. So if we put R in position 4 or 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Let me list some words:
 - ""ROUST"": R (position 1), O, U, S, T -> tests O, U, S, T (and R in a new position)
 - ""TRIPS"": T, R (position 2), I, P, S -> but position 2 was already tried for R and it was wrong? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it's not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: 
   R _ _ _ _

 We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.

 Examples: 
   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don't know about B and T. But note: we have two O's? We don't know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O? Actually, it's valid, but let's see if we can get more common letters.

   ""ROILS"" -> R, O, I, L, S -> tests O, I, L, S.

   ""ROUST"" as I thought earlier: R, O, U, S, T.

   ""ROWDY"" -> R, O, W, D, Y -> tests O, W, D, Y.

   ""RUSTS"" -> but has duplicate S? And we don't know if S is in the word.

   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.

   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.

 We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.

 So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don't know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.

 But we also want to test R in a position that we haven't tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don't have much to go on.

 Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it's correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.

 But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.

 How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.

 So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.

 How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That's good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don't know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).

 But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is in the word. We are testing P.

 Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.

 So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.

 I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

 Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).

 So I'll go with ""ROUST"".

 But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.

 But we don't know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.

 After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).

 So let's go with ""ROUST"".

<guess>roust</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.
- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.

I chose **""ROUST""** because:
- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.

<guess>roust</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got '-' for R in position 1]
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T

We also know that R is in the word, but it's not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Now, the secret word has the following constraints:
- Position 2 is O.
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 (since we know it's correct).
- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).
- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R:
- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.
- If we put R in position 4, we test that.
- If we put R in position 5, we test that.

But note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.

We also know that position 1 is open and we haven't tested many letters for position 1.

Let's think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.

For example:
- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _
- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _
- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R

We also need to avoid the absent letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.
  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.
  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.

Option 2: R in position 4: 
  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.
  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.
  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.

We need to avoid E. So words with E are out.

What about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: 
- D: not tested
- O: in position 2 (correct)
- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.

But we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _

For example: 
  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.
  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.
  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.

It's hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.

What about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R
- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.
- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.
- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

Also hard.

Alternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.

But note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.

Another word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. 

What about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

Another idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.

""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Let me think of words: 
- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.
- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.

But we also want to test other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.

Another candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??

Actually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.

We need the second letter to be O.

Let me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)

Common words:
- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.
- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.
- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.
- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.
- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

Another: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.

We must avoid position 1 for R.

So, let's try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.

But note: we are also testing M, P, H.

Another word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

But ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.

Another: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

But we don't know if F, B, Y are in the word.

We can also consider R in position 4: 
- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)
- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.
- ""GORED"" -> E absent.
- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.

It's difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.

""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

We need O in position 2.

Another idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.

""DOZEN"" -> invalid.

""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit R.

We must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.

So, let's focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words:
- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.

""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.

""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.

""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""JOKER"" same.

""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.

So, let's try ""MORPH"": 
- M: new
- O: correct (we know)
- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)
- P: new
- H: new

This tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M.

Another option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.

We can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.

For example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.

""COMER"" invalid.

""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.

""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.

""HOYER"" -> not common.

""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.

""POKER"" -> invalid.

""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.

So, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.

Therefore, let's go with ""MORPH"" for now.

But note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven't tested position 4.

Another word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.

""GORMY"" -> not common.

""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.

""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.

So, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

But wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.

Similarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.

We can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.

""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.

""BORED"" invalid.

So, let's choose ""MORPH"".

But note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.

We are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.

If we get feedback that R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in 4 or 5.

So, I'll go with ""MORPH"".

But let me check if there's a word that tests more common letters.

Another word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??.

""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching.

We need the second letter to be O.

So, ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. 
- M: not tested -> good.
- O: correct -> we know.
- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.
- P: not tested -> good.
- H: not tested -> good.

And no absent letters.

So, I'll guess ""MORPH"".

But wait, what about ""FORBY""? It's also valid and tests F, B, Y.

But ""MORPH"" is more common.

Alternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O's? But we don't know if the word has two O's? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.

But we are trying to test R's position.

""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.

We must have O in position 2.

So, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".

But note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.

Similarly, P and H.

So, let's do it.

<guess>morph</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct and in position 2. U, S, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- **O is fixed in position 2**.
- **R is in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T. We must avoid these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R/O are confirmed present).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Must include O in position 2** and **R in position 3, 4, or 5** (to test its location).
- **Test new common letters** (e.g., M, P, H) to gather more information.
- **Avoid absent letters** and positions that are already ruled out for R.

I chose **""MORPH""** because:
- It places O in position 2 (correct, as confirmed).
- It tests R in position 3 (a new position to check).
- It introduces three new common letters: M (position 1), P (position 4), and H (position 5).
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if R is in position 3 (if ✓, we lock in position 3; if -, we know R is in 4/5).
- Reveal if M, P, or H are in the word and their positions.

<guess>morph</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)
Guess 3: morph -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) R(✓) P(-) H(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""morph""
- M: x (not in word)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [This is new! R is in position 3]
- P: - (in word, but not in position 4)
- H: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback:

Confirmed letters:
- O is in position 2 (from guess2 and guess3).
- R is in position 3 (from guess3: R✓ in position 3).

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ O R _ _

Also, we know:
- The first letter is unknown, but not C, A, N, E, M, U, S, T, H (from the x's).
- The fourth and fifth letters are unknown, but not P (since P is in the word but not in position 4) and also not the absent letters.

Present letters:
- R is in position 3 (fixed).
- O is in position 2 (fixed).
- P is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""morph"" feedback: P- in position 4).

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H

We also know that from ""crane"", R was not in position 2, and now we know it's in position 3.

So the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] [letter5]

We know P is in the word, but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1 or 5? But position 1 is open, and position 5 is open. However, P could also be in position 1 or 5? But we don't know yet. The feedback for ""morph"" says P is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by O and R).

But note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 2 is O and position 3 is R. So P must be in position 1 or 5? Or could it be in position 4? But the feedback says it's not in position 4, so only position 1 or 5.

Also, we have to consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't seen any.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Has O in position 2 and R in position 3 (since they are confirmed).
- Includes P (because we know it's in the word) but not in position 4 (and not in position 3 because that's R). So P must be in position 1 or 5.
- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.

So the word pattern: [1] O R [4] [5]

And P is in one of the unknown positions: 1 or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are other letters that might be in the word.

We also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 4, and 5? Actually, three positions: 1, 4, and 5. But we know one of them must be P? Not necessarily, because P might be in one of them, but we also have to consider that there might be another letter.

But we know P is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.

The other two positions (if P is in 1, then positions 4 and 5 are open; if P is in 5, then positions 1 and 4 are open) could be any letters from the available set.

Available letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O, R, P are in the word, but O and R are fixed).

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we must include it in the guess, but in a position that is not 4 (since it can't be in 4). So we must put P in position 1 or 5.

We also need to test the remaining positions.

Let's consider the two cases:

Case 1: P is in position 1 -> then the word is P O R [4] [5]
Case 2: P is in position 5 -> then the word is [1] O R [4] P

We need to choose a word that can help distinguish between these cases and also test the fourth and fifth positions.

But note: we have to use a valid English word.

We can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has P in position 1 or 5 and tests new letters for the other positions.

However, we also need to test the fourth position.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and include P in position 1 or 5.

First, if P is in position 1: then the word is P O R ? ?

We need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not absent and form a word.

Possible words: 
- ""PORCH"" -> but C and H are absent.
- ""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.
- ""PORGY"" -> G and Y: P, O, R, G, Y -> avoids absent letters? G and Y are available. So ""PORGY"" is a word? It means fatty or related to pork, but might be accepted. However, let's see if there are better options.

But we don't know if G and Y are in the word.

Alternatively, ""PORGY"" has P in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.

But we are testing P in position 1. If we get a check for P, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then P must be in position 5.

But we also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.

Another word: ""PORED"" -> P, O, R, E, D -> but E is absent (from guess1), invalid.

""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.

""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A absent.

""PORGY"" might be acceptable, but let's see if there's a better one.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2 and R in position 3. ""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching. We need O in 2 and R in 3.

So, for the pattern P O R ? ?, we need a word like ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is one.

Another: ""PORBS"" -> not a word? ""PORB"" is not 5 letters.

""PORGY"" is 5 letters and valid? Yes, meaning obese or related to pork. It's in the dictionary.

But we can also try without P in position 1? But we are considering that.

Alternatively, if P is in position 5: then the word is ? O R ? P

For example: ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> but we don't have P? We need to include P because we know it's in the word. So we must include P.

So, for the pattern ? O R ? P, we need a word with P at the end.

Examples: 
- ""FORUP"" -> not a word.
- ""JUMPS"" -> S absent and no P? We need P at the end.

""WORDY"" doesn't have P.

""FORGY"" -> F, O, R, G, Y -> but no P? We need to include P? Actually, we know P is in the word, so we must include it.

So, for the pattern with P in position 5: we need a word like [letter] O R [letter] P

What words are there? 
- ""TROP"" is 4 letters.
- ""CROPP"" -> C absent, and not 5 letters? ""CROP"" is 4.

5-letter words: 
- ""CROPP"" is 5 but C absent.
- ""WORPP"" -> not a word.

Actually, it's hard. Let me think.

""FORIPP"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""GORPP"" -> not a word.

This might be difficult. Maybe P is not in position 5? We have to consider both possibilities.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 1 and then test other letters for the fourth and fifth.

But we also need to test if the fourth and fifth are filled with available letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.

But we need a valid word.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and include P.

First, with P in position 1: ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is the only common one I can think of. But let's check if there are others.

""PORCH"" -> C and H absent.

""PORKS"" -> S absent.

""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.

""PORGY"" is one.

Now, with P in position 5: 
- ""BORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""DORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""FURPP"" -> not a word.
- ""KORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""LORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""MORPP"" -> not a word.
- ""PORPP"" -> not a word.

What about ""FORP"" is 4 letters? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with P at the end and O in the middle and R at the beginning? The pattern is ? O R ? P.

For example, ""AORAP"" -> not a word and A absent.

""EORPP"" -> not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe P is in position 1.

So, let's assume P is in position 1 for now, and we can test ""PORGY"".

But we also need to test the fourth and fifth letters. In ""PORGY"", we are testing G in position 4 and Y in position 5.

If we guess ""PORGY"", then:
- If P is in position 1, we get a check for P.
- If not, then P must be in position 5, and we will get a '-' for P in position 1? But we know P is in the word, so if we put P in position 1 and it's actually in position 5, we get a '-' for P in position 1? And then we know P is in position 5.

But we also get feedback for G and Y.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.

But as we saw, it's hard to find such a word.

Another word: ""FORUM"" -> but U is absent.

""GORGE"" -> E absent.

""YORKE"" -> Y, O, R, K, E -> E absent.

So, ""PORGY"" seems a reasonable choice, even if it's uncommon.

But let's see if there's a more common word.

What about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No.

We must have O in position 2 and R in position 3.

Another word: ""PROBE"" -> P, R, O, B, E -> E absent.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMO"" -> P, R, O, M, O -> M absent (from guess3) and O in position 3? Not 2.

""PROMY"" -> not a word.

""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3? Not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and includes P.

But let's confirm: ""PORGY"" is 5 letters: P-O-R-G-Y.

And it avoids the absent letters: no C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But note: we are also testing G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If P is in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know P must be in position 5.
- We also get feedback for G and Y.

But we have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two P's? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice.

But in ""PORGY"", we are using P only once.

We can also consider that the fourth and fifth positions might be filled with other letters.

But we have to include P in the guess because we know it's in the word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have P in position 1 or 5? But we must include P because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

But we can't avoid P.

Another word: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> but we don't have P? We must include P because we know it's in the word. So we cannot omit P.

We must include P in the guess.

So, let's go with ""PORGY"".

But note: we are putting P in position 1. If P is actually in position 5, then we will get a '-' for P in position 1 and then we know P is in position 5.

We also test G in position 4 and Y in position 5.

If we get a check for P, then we know P is in position 1.

So, we can use ""PORGY"".

But is ""PORGY"" a valid word? It's in the dictionary as an adjective meaning having a pig-like appearance or features.

We can also consider ""PROWL"" but O is not in position 2.

Another word: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.

I think ""PORGY"" is the best option.

But let's see if there's a word with P in position 5.

For example, ""BORPP"" not a word.

""WORDY"" no P.

""FORPY"" -> not a word.

""GORPY"" -> not a word.

""YORPP"" -> not a word.

So, I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""PORGY"".

But note: we are also testing G and Y. If they are in the word, we get feedback.

So, let's do it.

<guess>porgy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2. 
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct in position 2. U, S, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""morph"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is present but not in position 4. H is absent.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 2: **O**
  - Position 3: **R**
- **Present letters**: O, R, P (with P not in position 4).
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.
- **Word structure**: `[1] O R [4] [5]`
- **P must be in position 1 or 5** (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test P in position 1 or 5** to resolve its location.
- **Test new common letters** for positions 4 and 5 (e.g., G, Y, L, D, F).
- **Avoid absent letters** and ruled-out positions for P.

I chose **""PORGY""** because:
- It places **O in position 2** and **R in position 3** (confirmed).
- It tests **P in position 1** (to check if P is in position 1 or 5).
- It introduces **G** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5), which are common letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if P is in position 1 (if ✓, P is locked in position 1; if -, P must be in position 5).
- Reveal if G or Y are in the word and their positions.

Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2, so we should avoid putting R in position 2 again because we already know it\'s not there. So ""TRIPS"" would put R in position 2 again, which we already know is wrong. So that would be a waste.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n We can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to form a word with R in position 1: \n   R _ _ _ _\n\n We need to fill the rest with letters that are not C, A, N, E, and we want to test new common letters.\n\n Examples: \n   ""ROBOT"" -> but has O, B, O, T. However, we don\'t know about B and T. But note: we have two O\'s? We don\'t know if O is in the word. Also, we are repeating O?

And we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\n   ""RIFTS"" -> R, I, F, T, S -> tests I, F, T, S.\n\n   ""RIGHT"" -> R, I, G, H, T -> tests I, G, H, T.\n\n We want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E, A, N are out. So we have T, O, I, S, H, R (we already know R is in), D, L, U.\n\n So a good candidate might be ""ROUST"" because it tests R (in position 1, which is new), and then O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPORT"" tests S, P, O, R, T. But note: we are putting R in position 4? In ""SPORT"", R is in position 4? Let me check: S P O R T -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So R is in position 4. We don\'t know if position 4 is correct for R? It might be.\n\n But we also want to test R in a position that we haven\'t tried. We tried position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Since we have no other information, we can try to put R in a position that is common. However, we don\'t have much to go on.\n\n Another idea: we know that R is in the word, so we can try to put R in position 1 to see if it\'s correct. If it is, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is in the word but not in position 1 either.\n\n But we have 5 more guesses, so we can afford to test.\n\n Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it tests four new vowels and consonants: O, U, S, T.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has O, U, S, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R and also includes other common consonants like T, S, L.\n\n How about ""TRULY""? But that has U, L, Y. And R in position 2? We must avoid position 2 for R? Actually, we can put R in position 2 again? But we already know that position 2 is not R, so it would be a waste. So we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use words that have R in position 2.\n\n So ""TRULY"" has R in position 2 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""STORM""? But we know that E is not in the word, so ""STORM"" has an E? No, ""STORM"" is S, T, O, R, M. That\'s good because we avoid A, C, N, E. But note: we don\'t know about M. However, we are putting R in position 4? In ""STORM"": S (1), T (2), O (3), R (4), M (5). So R is in position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""STORM"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we already know that R is in the word, so we are testing S, T, O, M, and R in a new position (4).\n\n But note: we are not sure if O is in the word. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" as I thought earlier: S, P, O, R, T -> R is in position 4.\n\n But we don\'t know if P is in the word. We are testing P.\n\n Another common word: ""ROAST"" -> but we know A is not in the word, so we cannot use A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.\n\n How about ""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S -> avoids A, C, N, E. And R is in position 1.\n\n So ""ROILS"" tests R (position 1), O, I, L, S.\n\n But we don\'t know if O, I, L, S are in the word.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" and ""ROILS"" are both good.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are also testing the positions. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n The most common letters left: T, O, I, S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\n Let me choose ""ROUST"" because it has U and O (two vowels) and S, T (common consonants).\n\n So I\'ll go with ""ROUST"".\n\n But note: we are putting R in position 1. If R is actually in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is not in position 1 and not in position 2 (from the first guess). Then we can try position 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" (S, P, O, R, T) -> R is in position 4. This tests S, P, O, T and R in position 4.\n\n But we don\'t know if P is common. Maybe we should avoid less common letters.\n\n After thinking, I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests four new letters (O, U, S, T) and R in a new position (1).\n\n So let\'s go with ""ROUST"".\n\n<guess>roust</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **not in position 2**.\n- Avoid **C, A, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, L, I) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **""ROUST""** because:\n- It places R in **position 1** (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: **O, U, S, T**.\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and position 2 for R.\n\n<guess>roust</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""roust""\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)  [since we got \'-\' for R in position 1]\n- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- O is in the word and in position 2. (from ""roust"" feedback: O✓)\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T\n\nWe also know that R is in the word, but it\'s not in position 1 (from ""roust"") and not in position 2 (from ""crane""). So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nNow, the secret word has the following constraints:\n- Position 2 is O.\n- R is in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 -> so in 3, 4, or 5.\n- The word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, S, T.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Has O in position 2 (since we know it\'s correct).\n- Includes R in one of the positions 3,4,5 (to test where it is).\n- Uses only letters that are not excluded. The available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and O are in, but O is fixed in position 2).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R:\n- If we put R in position 3, we can test that.\n- If we put R in position 4, we test that.\n- If we put R in position 5, we test that.\n\nBut note: we have to choose one word. We can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nWe also know that position 1 is open and we haven\'t tested many letters for position 1.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have O in the second position and R in either 3,4, or 5.\n\nFor example:\n- If R is in position 3: _ O R _ _\n- If R is in position 4: _ O _ R _\n- If R is in position 5: _ O _ _ R\n\nWe also need to avoid the absent letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nOption 1: R in position 3: e.g., ""BORIC"" -> but C is absent, so invalid.\n  - ""FOLIC"" -> F, O, L, I, C -> but C is absent.\n  - ""MORPH"" -> M, O, R, P, H -> avoids absent letters? M, O, R, P, H: none of C,A,N,E,U,S,T. So valid.\n\nOption 2: R in position 4: \n  - ""DOZER"" -> but E and R? We know E is absent, so no.\n  - ""HOVER"" -> H, O, V, E, R -> E is absent, invalid.\n  - ""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent, invalid.\n  - ""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent, invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid E. So words with E are out.\n\nWhat about ""DORKY""? But D, O, R, K, Y: \n- D: not tested\n- O: in position 2 (correct)\n- R: in position 3? We are considering R in position 4? This has R in position 3? Actually, D O R K Y -> R is in position 3.\n\nBut we are considering R in position 4: so the pattern is _ O _ R _\n\nFor example: \n  - ""BORED"" -> B, O, R, E, D -> E is absent, invalid.\n  - ""FORUM"" -> F, O, R, U, M -> U is absent (from guess2: Ux), invalid.\n  - ""GORGE"" -> G, O, R, G, E -> E absent, invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with R in position 4 without the forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about R in position 5: _ O _ _ R\n- ""COMER"" -> C and E absent, invalid.\n- ""DOPER"" -> D, O, P, E, R -> E absent.\n- ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\nAlso hard.\n\nAlternatively, we can try R in position 3: e.g., ""MORPH"" as I thought earlier: M, O, R, P, H -> positions: M(1), O(2), R(3), P(4), H(5). This uses M, P, H which are new.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we might get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""FORUM"" is invalid because of U. \n\nWhat about ""GROWL"": G, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? We need O in position 2. So not.\n\nWe must have O in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but U is absent (from guess2: Ux), so invalid.\n\n""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??\n\nLet me think of words: \n- ""DOZEN"" -> D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N absent, invalid.\n- ""DORKY"": D, O, R, K, Y -> R is in position 3? So if we use this, R is in position 3. But we are not testing position 4 or 5 for R. We can use this to test R in position 3.\n\nBut we also want to test other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R in a different position and also tests common letters for the other spots.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BROIL"" -> B, R, O, I, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??\n\nActually, ""BROIL"" is B(1), R(2), O(3), I(4), L(5) -> O is in position 3, not 2. So not.\n\nWe need the second letter to be O.\n\nLet me list words with O in the second position and without the absent letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R must be in 3,4,5)\n\nCommon words:\n- ""MORPH"": M, O, R, P, H -> R in position 3.\n- ""YORKS"": Y, O, R, K, S -> but S is absent (from guess2: Sx), invalid.\n- ""WORKS"": W, O, R, K, S -> S absent.\n- ""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.\n- ""GORGE"": G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.\n\nAnother: ""JOKER"" -> J, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""ROVER"": R, O, V, E, R -> E absent and also R in position 1? But we know R is not in position 1 (from guess2: R- when in position1). So we cannot put R in position 1.\n\nWe must avoid position 1 for R.\n\nSo, let\'s try R in position 3: ""MORPH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning to change form.\n\nBut note: we are also testing M, P, H.\n\nAnother word: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut ""DORKY"" is a word? Yes, meaning awkward or clumsy.\n\nAnother: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if F, B, Y are in the word.\n\nWe can also consider R in position 4: \n- ""BORED"" -> invalid (E absent)\n- ""CORED"" -> C absent, E absent.\n- ""GORED"" -> E absent.\n- ""YORES"" -> E absent and S absent.\n\nIt\'s difficult. What about ""FORMY""? Not a word.\n\n""PROsy"" -> but S absent and also O is in position 2? P R O S Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.\n\nWe need O in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOING"" -> D, O, I, N, G -> but N is absent (from guess1: Nx), invalid.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> invalid.\n\n""DOILY"": D, O, I, L, Y -> but no R? We must include R because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit R.\n\nWe must include R in the guess because we need to find its position.\n\nSo, let\'s focus on words with O in position 2 and R in 3,4, or 5, and using only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nCommon words:\n- R in position 3: ""MORPH"", ""DORKY"", ""FORBY"", ""GROWL"" but O not in 2? ""GROWL"" is G, R, O, W, L -> O is in position 3, not 2.\n\n""GORGE"" is G, O, R, G, E -> E absent.\n\n""FORUM"" is F, O, R, U, M -> U absent.\n\n""POKER"" is P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""JOKER"" same.\n\n""ROVER"" has R in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""MORPH"": \n- M: new\n- O: correct (we know)\n- R: in position 3 (we are testing if R is in position 3)\n- P: new\n- H: new\n\nThis tests M, P, H and confirms R in position 3 or not.\n\nBut note: we are also testing position 1 with M.\n\nAnother option: ""DORKY"" -> D, O, R, K, Y -> tests D, K, Y.\n\nBut ""MORPH"" is more common? Maybe.\n\nWe can also try R in position 5: but we need a word like _ O _ _ R.\n\nFor example: ""TOMOR"" -> not a word? ""TOMOR"" is not standard. ""TOMY"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""COMER"" invalid.\n\n""DOBER"" -> D, O, B, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""FOYER"" -> F, O, Y, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""HOYER"" -> not common.\n\n""LOVER"" -> L, O, V, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POKER"" -> invalid.\n\n""ROBBER"" -> R in position 1? Invalid.\n\nSo, it seems difficult to find a word with R in position 5 without forbidden letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""MORPH"" for now.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that R might be in position 4. We haven\'t tested position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""FORMY"" is not a word.\n\n""GORMY"" -> not common.\n\n""BORAX"" -> B, O, R, A, X -> but A is absent (from guess1: Ax), invalid.\n\n""JORAM"" -> J, O, R, A, M -> A absent.\n\nSo, ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut wait, we have ""FORBY"": F, O, R, B, Y -> R in position 3. Tests F, B, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""DORKY"": R in position 3. Tests D, K, Y.\n\nWe can also try ""HORDE"" -> H, O, R, D, E -> E absent.\n\n""HOIST"" -> H, O, I, S, T -> but S and T are absent (from guess2: Sx and Tx), invalid.\n\n""BORED"" invalid.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""MORPH"".\n\nBut note: we are putting R in position 3. If R is actually in position 3, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe are also testing M in position 1, P in position 4, H in position 5.\n\nIf we get feedback that R is not in position 3, then we know it must be in 4 or 5.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""MORPH"".\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> but O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2. So the word must be ?O??.\n\n""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching.\n\nWe need the second letter to be O.\n\nSo, ""MORPH"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""MORPH"" uses M, O, R, P, H. \n- M: not tested -> good.\n- O: correct -> we know.\n- R: we are testing position 3 -> good.\n- P: not tested -> good.\n- H: not tested -> good.\n\nAnd no absent letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""MORPH"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""FORBY""? It\'s also valid and tests F, B, Y.\n\nBut ""MORPH"" is more common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""GROWL"" but O is not in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWD"" -> C absent, invalid.\n\n""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> but O is in position 3 and 4? And we have two O\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two O\'s? It might. But we know O is in position 2, so if we put O in position 4, it might be present or not.\n\nBut we are trying to test R\'s position.\n\n""PROOF"" has O in position 3 and 4? P(1), R(2), O(3), O(4), F(5). But we need O in position 2. So not.\n\nWe must have O in position 2.\n\nSo, I think ""MORPH"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""MORPH"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing position 1 with M. If M is in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSimilarly, P and H.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>morph</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.\n- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1 (and not in position 2, from Guess 1). O is correct and in position 2. U, S, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **O is fixed in position 2**.\n- **R is in the word** but cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T. We must avoid these.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and R/O are confirmed present).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Must include O in position 2** and **R in position 3, 4, or 5** (to test its location).\n- **Test new common letters** (e.g., M, P, H) to gather more information.\n- **Avoid absent letters** and positions that are already ruled out for R.\n\nI chose **""MORPH""** because:\n- It places O in position 2 (correct, as confirmed).\n- It tests R in position 3 (a new position to check).\n- It introduces three new common letters: M (position 1), P (position 4), and H (position 5).\n- It avoids all absent letters (C, A, N, E, U, S, T).\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if R is in position 3 (if ✓, we lock in position 3; if -, we know R is in 4/5).\n- Reveal if M, P, or H are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>morph</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: roust -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) S(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: morph -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) R(✓) P(-) H(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 2)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""roust""\n- R: - (in word, but not in position 1)\n- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- U: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ""morph""\n- M: x (not in word)\n- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)  [This is new! R is in position 3]\n- P: - (in word, but not in position 4)\n- H: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback:\n\nConfirmed letters:\n- O is in position 2 (from guess2 and guess3).\n- R is in position 3 (from guess3: R✓ in position 3).\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ O R _ _\n\nAlso, we know:\n- The first letter is unknown, but not C, A, N, E, M, U, S, T, H (from the x\'s).\n- The fourth and fifth letters are unknown, but not P (since P is in the word but not in position 4) and also not the absent letters.\n\nPresent letters:\n- R is in position 3 (fixed).\n- O is in position 2 (fixed).\n- P is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""morph"" feedback: P- in position 4).\n\nAbsent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H\n\nWe also know that from ""crane"", R was not in position 2, and now we know it\'s in position 3.\n\nSo the word is: [letter1] O R [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWe know P is in the word, but not in position 4. So P must be in position 1 or 5? But position 1 is open, and position 5 is open. However, P could also be in position 1 or 5? But we don\'t know yet. The feedback for ""morph"" says P is in the word but not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by O and R).\n\nBut note: the word has 5 positions. We know position 2 is O and position 3 is R. So P must be in position 1 or 5? Or could it be in position 4? But the feedback says it\'s not in position 4, so only position 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, we have to consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven\'t seen any.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that:\n- Has O in position 2 and R in position 3 (since they are confirmed).\n- Includes P (because we know it\'s in the word) but not in position 4 (and not in position 3 because that\'s R). So P must be in position 1 or 5.\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H.\n\nSo the word pattern: [1] O R [4] [5]\n\nAnd P is in one of the unknown positions: 1 or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are other letters that might be in the word.\n\nWe also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.\n\nWe have two unknown positions: 1, 4, and 5? Actually, three positions: 1, 4, and 5. But we know one of them must be P? Not necessarily, because P might be in one of them, but we also have to consider that there might be another letter.\n\nBut we know P is in the word and not in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nThe other two positions (if P is in 1, then positions 4 and 5 are open; if P is in 5, then positions 1 and 4 are open) could be any letters from the available set.\n\nAvailable letters (excluding absent ones): B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know O, R, P are in the word, but O and R are fixed).\n\nBut note: P is already known to be in the word, so we must include it in the guess, but in a position that is not 4 (since it can\'t be in 4). So we must put P in position 1 or 5.\n\nWe also need to test the remaining positions.\n\nLet\'s consider the two cases:\n\nCase 1: P is in position 1 -> then the word is P O R [4] [5]\nCase 2: P is in position 5 -> then the word is [1] O R [4] P\n\nWe need to choose a word that can help distinguish between these cases and also test the fourth and fifth positions.\n\nBut note: we have to use a valid English word.\n\nWe can try to cover both possibilities by choosing a word that has P in position 1 or 5 and tests new letters for the other positions.\n\nHowever, we also need to test the fourth position.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern and include P in position 1 or 5.\n\nFirst, if P is in position 1: then the word is P O R ? ?\n\nWe need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not absent and form a word.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""PORCH"" -> but C and H are absent.\n- ""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.\n- ""PORGY"" -> G and Y: P, O, R, G, Y -> avoids absent letters? G and Y are available. So ""PORGY"" is a word? It means fatty or related to pork, but might be accepted. However, let\'s see if there are better options.\n\nBut we don\'t know if G and Y are in the word.\n\nAlternatively, ""PORGY"" has P in position 1, O in 2, R in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.\n\nBut we are testing P in position 1. If we get a check for P, then we know it\'s in position 1. If not, then P must be in position 5.\n\nBut we also need to test the fourth and fifth positions.\n\nAnother word: ""PORED"" -> P, O, R, E, D -> but E is absent (from guess1), invalid.\n\n""POKER"" -> P, O, K, E, R -> E absent.\n\n""POLAR"" -> P, O, L, A, R -> A absent.\n\n""PORGY"" might be acceptable, but let\'s see if there\'s a better one.\n\nWhat about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No, we need O in position 2 and R in position 3. ""PROWL"" is P, R, O, W, L -> positions: P(1), R(2), O(3) -> not matching. We need O in 2 and R in 3.\n\nSo, for the pattern P O R ? ?, we need a word like ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is one.\n\nAnother: ""PORBS"" -> not a word? ""PORB"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""PORGY"" is 5 letters and valid? Yes, meaning obese or related to pork. It\'s in the dictionary.\n\nBut we can also try without P in position 1? But we are considering that.\n\nAlternatively, if P is in position 5: then the word is ? O R ? P\n\nFor example: ""WORDY"" -> W, O, R, D, Y -> but we don\'t have P? We need to include P because we know it\'s in the word. So we must include P.\n\nSo, for the pattern ? O R ? P, we need a word with P at the end.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FORUP"" -> not a word.\n- ""JUMPS"" -> S absent and no P? We need P at the end.\n\n""WORDY"" doesn\'t have P.\n\n""FORGY"" -> F, O, R, G, Y -> but no P? We need to include P? Actually, we know P is in the word, so we must include it.\n\nSo, for the pattern with P in position 5: we need a word like [letter] O R [letter] P\n\nWhat words are there? \n- ""TROP"" is 4 letters.\n- ""CROPP"" -> C absent, and not 5 letters? ""CROP"" is 4.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""CROPP"" is 5 but C absent.\n- ""WORPP"" -> not a word.\n\nActually, it\'s hard. Let me think.\n\n""FORIPP"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""GORPP"" -> not a word.\n\nThis might be difficult. Maybe P is not in position 5? We have to consider both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 1 and then test other letters for the fourth and fifth.\n\nBut we also need to test if the fourth and fifth are filled with available letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.\n\nBut we need a valid word.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the pattern and include P.\n\nFirst, with P in position 1: ""PORGY"", ""PORGY"" is the only common one I can think of. But let\'s check if there are others.\n\n""PORCH"" -> C and H absent.\n\n""PORKS"" -> S absent.\n\n""PORNS"" -> N and S absent.\n\n""PORGY"" is one.\n\nNow, with P in position 5: \n- ""BORPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""DORPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""FURPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""KORPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""LORPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""MORPP"" -> not a word.\n- ""PORPP"" -> not a word.\n\nWhat about ""FORP"" is 4 letters? \n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with P at the end and O in the middle and R at the beginning? The pattern is ? O R ? P.\n\nFor example, ""AORAP"" -> not a word and A absent.\n\n""EORPP"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe P is in position 1.\n\nSo, let\'s assume P is in position 1 for now, and we can test ""PORGY"".\n\nBut we also need to test the fourth and fifth letters. In ""PORGY"", we are testing G in position 4 and Y in position 5.\n\nIf we guess ""PORGY"", then:\n- If P is in position 1, we get a check for P.\n- If not, then P must be in position 5, and we will get a \'-\' for P in position 1? But we know P is in the word, so if we put P in position 1 and it\'s actually in position 5, we get a \'-\' for P in position 1? And then we know P is in position 5.\n\nBut we also get feedback for G and Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has P in position 5 and tests two new letters for position 1 and 4.\n\nBut as we saw, it\'s hard to find such a word.\n\nAnother word: ""FORUM"" -> but U is absent.\n\n""GORGE"" -> E absent.\n\n""YORKE"" -> Y, O, R, K, E -> E absent.\n\nSo, ""PORGY"" seems a reasonable choice, even if it\'s uncommon.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a more common word.\n\nWhat about ""PROWL""? But O is in position 3? No.\n\nWe must have O in position 2 and R in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""PROBE"" -> P, R, O, B, E -> E absent.\n\n""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> O in position 3? Not 2.\n\n""PROMO"" -> P, R, O, M, O -> M absent (from guess3) and O in position 3? Not 2.\n\n""PROMY"" -> not a word.\n\n""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3? Not 2.\n\nI think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and includes P.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: ""PORGY"" is 5 letters: P-O-R-G-Y.\n\nAnd it avoids the absent letters: no C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H.\n\nSo, we can use ""PORGY"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing G and Y.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If P is in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know P must be in position 5.\n- We also get feedback for G and Y.\n\nBut we have to consider that there might be other words.\n\nAnother possibility: what if the word has duplicate letters? For example, could there be two P\'s? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nWe know P is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice.\n\nBut in ""PORGY"", we are using P only once.\n\nWe can also consider that the fourth and fifth positions might be filled with other letters.\n\nBut we have to include P in the guess because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have P in position 1 or 5? But we must include P because we know it\'s in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nBut we can\'t avoid P.\n\nAnother word: ""FORBY"" -> F, O, R, B, Y -> but we don\'t have P? We must include P because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot omit P.\n\nWe must include P in the guess.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PORGY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting P in position 1. If P is actually in position 5, then we will get a \'-\' for P in position 1 and then we know P is in position 5.\n\nWe also test G in position 4 and Y in position 5.\n\nIf we get a check for P, then we know P is in position 1.\n\nSo, we can use ""PORGY"".\n\nBut is ""PORGY"" a valid word? It\'s in the dictionary as an adjective meaning having a pig-like appearance or features.\n\nWe can also consider ""PROWL"" but O is not in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> O is in position 3, not 2.\n\nI think ""PORGY"" is the best option.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word with P in position 5.\n\nFor example, ""BORPP"" not a word.\n\n""WORDY"" no P.\n\n""FORPY"" -> not a word.\n\n""GORPY"" -> not a word.\n\n""YORPP"" -> not a word.\n\nSo, I think ""PORGY"" is the only common word that fits.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""PORGY"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing G and Y. If they are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>porgy</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent.

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present, but not in position 2)
- A: x (absent)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: ""roust""
- R: - (present, but not in position 1)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- U: x (absent)
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""morph""
- M: x (absent)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- P: - (present, but not in position 4)
- H: x (absent)

Guess 4: ""porgy""
- P: ✓ (correct, in position 1)
- O: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- R: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- G: x (absent)
- Y: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So, from all feedback, we know:

1. Position 1: P (from guess4: P✓)
2. Position 2: O (from guess2 and guess3, confirmed)
3. Position 3: R (from guess3: R✓)
4. Position 5: Y (from guess4: Y✓)

Therefore, the secret word is: P O R _ Y

We only need to find the fourth letter.

But note: we also know that the letter in position 4 must not be any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G (from guess4: Gx).

Additionally, we know that the letter in position 4 cannot be P, O, R, or Y (because they are already in the word, and we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far). However, we must be cautious.

From the feedback of ""porgy"":
- P, O, R, Y are all in their correct positions (except G which is absent).
- The only unknown is the fourth letter.

But note: in ""porgy"", the fourth letter is G, and it was absent. So the fourth letter is not G.

We also know from previous guesses that the following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G.

So the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G.

We need to find a letter for the fourth position that is not in the absent list and forms a valid English word.

The word is: P O R ? Y

What letters can we use? The available letters are: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any other not mentioned, but note that we have used: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H,P,O,R,Y,G).

But P, O, R, Y are in the word, so the fourth letter must be a new letter not in {C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H,G,P,O,R,Y}.

However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we have no indication so far. Since we have four letters already and one missing, it's possible but unlikely.

But to be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already in the word? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicates. But since we have no feedback suggesting duplicates, we can assume no duplicates for now.

So, the fourth letter must be a letter not in {P,O,R,Y} and not in the absent list.

Absent list: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G.

So available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, what words are there that fit ""P O R _ Y""?

We need a 5-letter word: P O R ? Y

Possible letters for the fourth position:

- B: ""PORBY""? Not a word.
- D: ""DORBY""? Not a word.
- F: ""FORBY""? Not a word.
- I: ""PORICY""? Not 5 letters? ""PORIC"" is 5 letters? P O R I C -> but C is absent (from guess1). Invalid.
- J: ""PORBY""? Not a word.
- K: ""PORKY""? Not a word.
- L: ""PORLY""? Not a word.
- Q: ""POR Quincy""? Not 5 letters.
- V: ""PORVY""? Not a word.
- W: ""PORWY""? Not a word.
- X: ""PORXY""? Not a word.
- Z: ""PORZY""? Not a word.

None of these are words. 

What about ""PORFY""? Not a word.

""PORHY""? H is absent.

""PORBY"" - not a word.

This is surprising. Maybe we missed a word.

Another idea: ""PORPY""? Not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? But we don't have any duplicate in the guess so far.

But note: in ""porgy"", we had P, O, R, Y, and G was absent. So the fourth letter is not G.

What about ""PORED""? But E is absent.

""POKER""? E absent.

""POLL Y""? Not a word.

""PURDY""? U absent.

I think we have a problem. Maybe we made a mistake.

Let me double-check the feedback for ""porgy"":

- P: ✓ (position 1)
- O: ✓ (position 2)
- R: ✓ (position 3)
- G: x (absent)
- Y: ✓ (position 5)

So the word is P O R ? Y, and G is absent, so the fourth letter is not G.

But what about ""PORNY""? But N is absent (from guess1) and S absent.

""PORCY""? C absent.

""PORFY""? Not a word.

""PORHY""? H absent.

""PORIV""? Not a word.

""PORL Y""? ""PORLY"" is not standard. ""PORL"" is not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""PORBY"" is not a word, but ""PORGY"" is a word? We already used ""porgy"" in guess4? Actually, in guess4 we guessed ""porgy"", but now we are guessing again.

But note: in guess4, we guessed ""porgy"" and got P✓, O✓, R✓, Gx, Y✓. So the word is P O R _ Y, and G is absent.

But what about ""PORGY""? That would be P O R G Y. But G was absent, so it cannot be ""PORGY"". Therefore, the fourth letter cannot be G.

So we need a different letter.

Another word: ""PORKY""? But K is available? ""PORKY"" is a word? It means fat or chubby. But let's check: P O R K Y -> that's 5 letters? P(1), O(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5). Yes, ""porky"" is a word.

And K is not in the absent list. Absent letters: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H,G. K is not in that list.

So ""PORKY"" is a valid word.

But wait, in ""porky"", the fourth letter is K. We haven't tested K before.

Similarly, ""PORFY"" is not a word.

""PORHY"" is not possible because H is absent.

""PORIV"" not a word.

""PORL Y"" not a word.

""PORBY"" not a word.

So ""PORKY"" seems to fit.

But let me confirm the pattern: P O R K Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y. Matches P O R _ Y.

And K is not excluded.

We also have to check if K is available: yes, not in the absent list.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""PORKY"".

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we have only one unknown letter, and we can solve it.

Is there any other possibility? What about ""PORNY""? But N and Y? N is absent, and we have Y at the end, but ""PORNY"" is not a standard word. Also, N is absent.

""PORCY"" -> C absent.

""PORGY"" we already tried and G is absent.

So ""PORKY"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me think: are there words like ""PORBY""? No, not a word.

Or ""FORBY""? But we already have P in position 1, and ""FORBY"" would be F O R B Y -> but we have P in position 1, so it must be ""PORKY"" or something else? But ""PORKY"" is the only one.

Another word: ""PURLY""? But U is absent and L is available? ""PURLY"" is not standard. ""PURL"" is 4 letters.

""PARKY""? K is available, but ""PARKY"" is a word? It's informal for parka, but might be accepted. However, let's see: P A R K Y -> but A is absent (from guess1). So invalid.

""PORKY"" is the best.

But we are not 100% sure because we haven't tested K. But given the constraints, it must be ""PORKY"".

We can also consider if there are other words with a different letter.

For example, ""PORKY"" uses K. Is there another? ""PORKS"" -> S absent.

""PORKT"" -> T absent.

""PORCH"" -> C and H absent.

So, I think ""PORKY"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Since we have only one letter to find, and it must be K, we can guess ""PORKY"".

But let me double-check the absent letters: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H,G.

K is not in this list, so it's valid.

Also, ""porky"" is a valid English word.

So, the next guess is ""PORKY"".

But note: we are not on the fifth guess. We are on the fifth guess? Let me count: guess1,2,3,4 -> now guess5.

We have one more guess to get it right.

So, we guess ""PORKY"".

But if we are wrong, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

But based on the information, it should be ""PORKY"".

Is there any other word? What about ""PORKY"" itself.

We can also consider ""PORKY"" as a candidate.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is another word with a different letter.

For example, ""PORKY"" with K, but is there another? For instance, ""PORKS"" but S is absent.

Or ""PORKT"" -> T absent.

""PORNY"" -> N absent.

So, I think ""PORKY"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we are putting K in position 4. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know it's not K, but since it's the only unknown, it must be another letter? But what other letters are possible?

We have the available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But for ""PORKY"", we use K. Is there another word? 

What about ""PORKY"" with a different letter? For example, ""PORKY"" is with K. Is there ""PORKY"" with B? ""PORKY"" is already the word? It's a proper noun? But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""porky"" is in the dictionary.

But let's confirm: ""porky"" is an adjective meaning talkative or effusively sentimental. It's accepted in Wordle.

We can also consider ""PORKY"" as the answer.

But to be safe, we should guess it.

Alternatively, if we are not sure, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one position unknown, so we can guess ""PORKY"" directly.

If we are wrong, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But since we have only one guess left (this is the fifth guess), we can afford to be wrong once.

But let's see: if we guess ""PORKY"", and if the fourth letter is not K, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we know it must be another letter. But what other letters? 

We have the available letters: B, D, F, I, J, L, V, W, X, Z.

Now, is there a word ""P O R B Y""? ""PORBY"" is not a word.

""P O R D Y""? ""PORDY"" -> not a word.

""P O R F Y""? ""PORFY"" -> not a word.

""P O R I Y""? ""PORIY"" not a word.

""P O R J Y""? ""PORJY"" not a word.

""P O R L Y""? ""PORLY"" not a word.

""P O R Q Y""? ""PORQY"" not a word.

""P O R V Y""? ""PORVY"" not a word.

""P O R W Y""? ""PORWY"" not a word.

""P O R X Y""? ""PORXY"" not a word.

""P O R Z Y""? ""PORZY"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word is ""PORKY"".

So, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we are putting K in position 4. If the word is ""PORKY"", then we get all correct.

If not, then we know K is absent, and we can try another letter in the next guess.

But since we are at the fifth guess, and we have only one letter to find, we can guess ""PORKY"".

So, the next guess is ""PORKY"".

But let me make sure: the word is P O R ? Y, and we are guessing K for the fourth position.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""PORKY"" is the only common one.

Perhaps ""PORKS"" but S is absent.

Or ""PORKT"" -> T absent.

So, I think it's safe to guess ""PORKY"".

Therefore, the guess is ""PORKY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1. O is correct in position 2. U, S, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""morph"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is present but not in position 4. H is absent.
- **Guess 4 (""porgy"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is correct in position 1. G is absent. Y is correct in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 1: **P** (from Guess 4: P✓)
  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 2 and 3: O✓)
  - Position 3: **R** (from Guess 3: R✓)
  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 4: Y✓)
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G (from all feedback).
- **Word structure**: **P O R _ Y**
- **Fourth position**: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not already in the word (since no duplicates have been indicated). Possible candidates: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting the pattern **P O R _ Y** is **""PORKY""** (meaning talkative or effusively sentimental). 
- **K** is chosen for the fourth position because it is a common letter not yet tested and is not in the absent list.
- If ""PORKY"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **K** will reveal which of the remaining options (e.g., B, D, F, I, L, V, W, X, Z) is correct for the fourth position.

Is there any other possibility? What about ""PORNY""? But N and Y? N is absent, and we have Y at the end, but ""PORNY"" is not a standard word. Also, N is absent.

""PORCY"" -> C absent.

""PORGY"" we already tried and G is absent.

So ""PORKY"" is the only common word that fits.

But let me think: are there words like ""PORBY""? No, not a word.

Or ""FORBY""? But we already have P in position 1, and ""FORBY"" would be F O R B Y -> but we have P in position 1, so it must be ""PORKY"" or something else? But ""PORKY"" is the only one.

Another word: ""PURLY""? But U is absent and L is available? ""PURLY"" is not standard. ""PURL"" is 4 letters.

""PARKY""? K is available, but ""PARKY"" is a word? It's informal for parka, but might be accepted. However, let's see: P A R K Y -> but A is absent (from guess1). So invalid.

""PORKY"" is the best.

But we are not 100% sure because we haven't tested K. But given the constraints, it must be ""PORKY"".

We can also consider if there are other words with a different letter.

For example, ""PORKY"" uses K. Is there another? ""PORKS"" -> S absent.

""PORKT"" -> T absent.

""PORCH"" -> C and H absent.

So, I think ""PORKY"" is the only possibility.

Therefore, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Since we have only one letter to find, and it must be K, we can guess ""PORKY"".

But let me double-check the absent letters: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,M,H,G.

K is not in this list, so it's valid.

Also, ""porky"" is a valid English word.

So, the next guess is ""PORKY"".

But note: we are not on the fifth guess. We are on the fifth guess? Let me count: guess1,2,3,4 -> now guess5.

We have one more guess to get it right.

So, we guess ""PORKY"".

But if we are wrong, we get feedback and then we can adjust.

But based on the information, it should be ""PORKY"".

Is there any other word? What about ""PORKY"" itself.

We can also consider ""PORKY"" as a candidate.

But to be thorough, let's see if there is another word with a different letter.

For example, ""PORKY"" with K, but is there another? For instance, ""PORKS"" but S is absent.

Or ""PORKT"" -> T absent.

""PORNY"" -> N absent.

So, I think ""PORKY"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we are putting K in position 4. If it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a '-' and then we know it's not K, but since it's the only unknown, it must be another letter? But what other letters are possible?

We have the available letters: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But for ""PORKY"", we use K. Is there another word? 

What about ""PORKY"" with a different letter? For example, ""PORKY"" is with K. Is there ""PORKY"" with B? ""PORKY"" is already the word? It's a proper noun? But in Wordle, proper nouns are not used? Actually, Wordle uses common words, and ""porky"" is in the dictionary.

But let's confirm: ""porky"" is an adjective meaning talkative or effusively sentimental. It's accepted in Wordle.

We can also consider ""PORKY"" as the answer.

But to be safe, we should guess it.

Alternatively, if we are not sure, we can guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one position unknown, so we can guess ""PORKY"" directly.

If we are wrong, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But since we have only one guess left (this is the fifth guess), we can afford to be wrong once.

But let's see: if we guess ""PORKY"", and if the fourth letter is not K, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we know it must be another letter. But what other letters? 

We have the available letters: B, D, F, I, J, L, V, W, X, Z.

Now, is there a word ""P O R B Y""? ""PORBY"" is not a word.

""P O R D Y""? ""PORDY"" -> not a word.

""P O R F Y""? ""PORFY"" -> not a word.

""P O R I Y""? ""PORIY"" not a word.

""P O R J Y""? ""PORJY"" not a word.

""P O R L Y""? ""PORLY"" not a word.

""P O R Q Y""? ""PORQY"" not a word.

""P O R V Y""? ""PORVY"" not a word.

""P O R W Y""? ""PORWY"" not a word.

""P O R X Y""? ""PORXY"" not a word.

""P O R Z Y""? ""PORZY"" not a word.

Therefore, the only common word is ""PORKY"".

So, we guess ""PORKY"".

But note: we are putting K in position 4. If the word is ""PORKY"", then we get all correct.

If not, then we know K is absent, and we can try another letter in the next guess.

But since we are at the fifth guess, and we have only one letter to find, we can guess ""PORKY"".

So, the next guess is ""PORKY"".

But let me make sure: the word is P O R ? Y, and we are guessing K for the fourth position.

If it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback that K is absent, and then we can try another letter.

But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""PORKY"" is the only common one.

Perhaps ""PORKS"" but S is absent.

Or ""PORKT"" -> T absent.

So, I think it's safe to guess ""PORKY"".

Therefore, the guess is ""PORKY"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, A, N, E are absent. R is present but not in position 2.
- **Guess 2 (""roust"")**: R is present but not in position 1. O is correct in position 2. U, S, T are absent.
- **Guess 3 (""morph"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is present but not in position 4. H is absent.
- **Guess 4 (""porgy"")**: M is absent. O is correct in position 2. R is correct in position 3. P is correct in position 1. G is absent. Y is correct in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 1: **P** (from Guess 4: P✓)
  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 2 and 3: O✓)
  - Position 3: **R** (from Guess 3: R✓)
  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 4: Y✓)
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, M, H, G (from all feedback).
- **Word structure**: **P O R _ Y**
- **Fourth position**: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not already in the word (since no duplicates have been indicated). Possible candidates: B, D, F, I, J, K, L, V, W, X, Z.

### Analysis:
- The only common English word fitting the pattern **P O R _ Y** is **""PORKY""** (meaning talkative or effusively sentimental). 
- **K** is chosen for the fourth position because it is a common letter not yet tested and is not in the absent list.
- If ""PORKY"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on **K** will reveal which of the remaining options (e.g., B, D, F, I, L, V, W, X, Z) is correct for the fourth position.",Guess 5: porky -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
