 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.

 Example: ""STOLE"" -> 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as '-' again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of E. So it's better to try E in a different position.

 How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.

 How about ""SETUP""? 
   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? 
   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""? 
   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": 
   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.

 We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.

 Since the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:

 - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

This guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.

<guess>eight</guess>",eight,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 How about ""SETUP""?

   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""?

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

This guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.",Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.

 Example: ""STOLE"" -> 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as '-' again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of E. So it's better to try E in a different position.

 How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.

 How about ""SETUP""? 
   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? 
   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""? 
   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": 
   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.

 We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.

 Since the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:

 - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

Not necessarily, but words usually do.\n\n Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.\n\n We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).\n - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don\'t know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in a different position.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.\n\n But we can also consider other words.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: \n      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)\n\n But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But let\'s think of other options.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.\n\n Example: ""STOLE"" -> \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of E. So it\'s better to try E in a different position.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? \n   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? \n   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.\n\n But let\'s think of words that have E in the first position: \n   ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).\n\n Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has B, O, W, L.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.\n\n How about ""HOMES""? \n   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? \n   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": \n   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.\n\n We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.\n\n Since the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:\n\n - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n How about ""E"" followed by other letters? \n\n - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that\'s 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. \n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E\'s and two T\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.\n\n However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.\n\n How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if P, S, T, O are in the word.\n\n Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.\n\n We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don\'t know. So we can try.\n\n However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.\n\n But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' again and we know E is not at 4 either.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? \n\n Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:\n\n - ""E"" at position 1: \n   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.\n\n But we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n Let me consider ""EIGHT"": \n   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we have E in the first position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.\n\n But note: we have L at the end. We don\'t know about L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we have two common letters: S and T. \n\n Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). \n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:\n\n ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n Possible: \n   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.\n   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. \n ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one \'-\' (for E) and then four new letters to test.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. \n The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.\n\n Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don\'t know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n But note: if we use a word with two E\'s, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E. It\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.\n\n Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? \n   This word: \n      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.\n\n But note: we have D at the end. \n\n We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? \n\n After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.\n\n But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at the beginning? We haven\'t tested the beginning.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? \n\n However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.\n\n I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that\'s the point: we are testing them.\n\n So let\'s go with ""EIGHT"".\n\n However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either \'-\' or if we are lucky, \'✓\') and also on I, G, H, T.\n\n But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n So let\'s choose ""EIGHT"".\n\n<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.\n- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""EIGHT""** fits well:\n- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).\n- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
- G, H, T are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _

And E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it's not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the second position.
- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the positions:

Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Position 2: must be I (fixed).
Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
Position 4: same as above.
Position 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).

We can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.

First, let's try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _
We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.

But we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _

We need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _
Possible words:
- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: 
  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.

But wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.

Another: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.
""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.
""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. 
""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let's see.

Actually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.

How about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E's? The feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.

However, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get '-'. If the letter is not in the word, we get 'x'. But if the word has two E's, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E's, then one of them might be '-' or 'x' and the other might be 'x' if the secret word has only one.

But we don't know if the secret word has one or two E's. So it might be risky.

We can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.

So let's try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _

Possible words:
- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? 
  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.
  - This uses L, V, S which are new.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.

Another: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.

But we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E's -> invalid because of C.

""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.

This is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes.

Another: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.

But we don't know if D is in the word.

We can also consider E in position 4: 
- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": 
  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we don't know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.

We can also try E in position 3: 
- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? 
  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as '-' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be 'x'. 
  - But if the secret word has two E's, then we might get two marks.

But we don't know, so it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.

So ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But ""BIKES"" has K and S. 

We can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without duplicates.

What about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E's. Let's avoid.

Another word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.

""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.

But J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.

Similarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

So invalid.

""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.

So let's stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".

We can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". 

But note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.

We can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.

The absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test O or U.

But in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). 

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? 
- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.

But we don't know if O is in the word.

Another: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? 

But we have to avoid T? Yes.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

So ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let's check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.

But we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.

Similarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.

But we have S at the end.

We can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.

So the word must have I in the second position.

Therefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With E in position 3 or 4.

And without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Let me list some words:

- With E in position 3: 
  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

So for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don't have many words with E in the middle? 

Actually, it's hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.

For example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? 

Let me clarify: 
- Position 3: the third letter.

So for E in position 3: the third letter is E.

Examples: 
- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.
- ""MIELS"" -> not common? 
- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.

Therefore, E is likely in position 4.

So we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven't tested position 3? Actually, we don't know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.

We can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.

But we also need to test position 1 and 5.

We have to choose a word that uses available letters.

Let me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]

Without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Possible words:
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).
- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.
- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.
- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.

We can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.

Another: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E's? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.

We cannot use E in position 1.

So let's choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.

""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.
""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.
""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.
""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.

S is a very common letter, so it's good to test S.

Also, L and D are common.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.

Alternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.

How about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

So I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven't tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it's more common? Or we can test both?

We can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don't have a good word without absent letters.

For example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".

If we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it's hard.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

So I think we should go with ""LIVES"".

But let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: 
- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.
- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.
- ""VIENS"" -> not common.

So probably E is in position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.

But ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.

So I'll go with ""LIVES"".

But note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).

Also, we test L, V, S.

So let's choose ""LIVES"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.
Second guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.

So yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**: 
  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).
  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **I in position 2**.
- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).
- Exclude all absent letters.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:
- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).
- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.
- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

This guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.

<guess>lives</guess>",lives,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
- G, H, T are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _

And E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it's not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the second position.
- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the positions:

Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Position 2: must be I (fixed).
Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
Position 4: same as above.
Position 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).

We can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.

First, let's try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _
We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.

But we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _

We need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _
Possible words:
- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: 
  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.

But wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.

Another: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.
""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.
""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. 
""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let's see.

Actually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.

How about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E's? The feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.

However, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get '-'. If the letter is not in the word, we get 'x'. But if the word has two E's, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E's, then one of them might be '-' or 'x' and the other might be 'x' if the secret word has only one.

But we don't know if the secret word has one or two E's. So it might be risky.

We can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.

So let's try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _

Possible words:
- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? 
  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.
  - This uses L, V, S which are new.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.

Another: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.

But we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E's -> invalid because of C.

""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.

This is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes.

Another: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.

But we don't know if D is in the word.

We can also consider E in position 4: 
- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": 
  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we don't know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.

We can also try E in position 3: 
- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? 
  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as '-' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be 'x'. 
  - But if the secret word has two E's, then we might get two marks.

But we don't know, so it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.

So ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But ""BIKES"" has K and S. 

We can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without duplicates.

What about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E's. Let's avoid.

Another word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.

""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.

But J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.

Similarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

So invalid.

""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.

So let's stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".

We can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". 

But note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.

We can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.

The absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test O or U.

But in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). 

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? 
- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.

But we don't know if O is in the word.

Another: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? 

But we have to avoid T? Yes.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

So ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let's check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.

But we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.

Similarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.

But we have S at the end.

We can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.

So the word must have I in the second position.

Therefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With E in position 3 or 4.

And without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Let me list some words:

- With E in position 3: 
  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

So for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don't have many words with E in the middle? 

Actually, it's hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.

For example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? 

Let me clarify: 
- Position 3: the third letter.

So for E in position 3: the third letter is E.

Examples: 
- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.
- ""MIELS"" -> not common? 
- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.

Therefore, E is likely in position 4.

So we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven't tested position 3? Actually, we don't know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.

We can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.

But we also need to test position 1 and 5.

We have to choose a word that uses available letters.

Let me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]

Without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Possible words:
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).
- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.
- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.
- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.

We can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.

Another: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E's? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.

We cannot use E in position 1.

So let's choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.

""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.
""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.
""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.
""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.

S is a very common letter, so it's good to test S.

Also, L and D are common.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.

Alternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.

How about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

So I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven't tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it's more common? Or we can test both?

We can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don't have a good word without absent letters.

For example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".

If we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it's hard.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

So I think we should go with ""LIVES"".

But let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: 
- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.
- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.
- ""VIENS"" -> not common.

So probably E is in position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.

But ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.

So I'll go with ""LIVES"".

But note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).

Also, we test L, V, S.

So let's choose ""LIVES"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.
Second guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.

So yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**: 
  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).
  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **I in position 2**.
- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).
- Exclude all absent letters.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:
- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).
- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.
- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

This guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.",Guess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.

 Example: ""STOLE"" -> 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as '-' again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of E. So it's better to try E in a different position.

 How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.

 How about ""SETUP""? 
   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? 
   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""? 
   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": 
   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.

 We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.

 Since the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:

 - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

This guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.

<guess>eight</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
- G, H, T are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _

And E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it's not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the second position.
- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the positions:

Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Position 2: must be I (fixed).
Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
Position 4: same as above.
Position 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).

We can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.

First, let's try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _
We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.

But we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _

We need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _
Possible words:
- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: 
  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.

But wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.

Another: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.
""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.
""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. 
""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let's see.

Actually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.

How about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E's? The feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.

However, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get '-'. If the letter is not in the word, we get 'x'. But if the word has two E's, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E's, then one of them might be '-' or 'x' and the other might be 'x' if the secret word has only one.

But we don't know if the secret word has one or two E's. So it might be risky.

We can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.

So let's try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _

Possible words:
- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? 
  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.
  - This uses L, V, S which are new.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.

Another: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.

But we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E's -> invalid because of C.

""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.

This is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes.

Another: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.

But we don't know if D is in the word.

We can also consider E in position 4: 
- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": 
  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we don't know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.

We can also try E in position 3: 
- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? 
  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as '-' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be 'x'. 
  - But if the secret word has two E's, then we might get two marks.

But we don't know, so it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.

So ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But ""BIKES"" has K and S. 

We can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without duplicates.

What about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E's. Let's avoid.

Another word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.

""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.

But J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.

Similarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

So invalid.

""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.

So let's stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".

We can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". 

But note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.

We can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.

The absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test O or U.

But in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). 

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? 
- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.

But we don't know if O is in the word.

Another: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? 

But we have to avoid T? Yes.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

So ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let's check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.

But we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.

Similarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.

But we have S at the end.

We can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.

So the word must have I in the second position.

Therefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With E in position 3 or 4.

And without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Let me list some words:

- With E in position 3: 
  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

So for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don't have many words with E in the middle? 

Actually, it's hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.

For example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? 

Let me clarify: 
- Position 3: the third letter.

So for E in position 3: the third letter is E.

Examples: 
- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.
- ""MIELS"" -> not common? 
- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.

Therefore, E is likely in position 4.

So we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven't tested position 3? Actually, we don't know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.

We can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.

But we also need to test position 1 and 5.

We have to choose a word that uses available letters.

Let me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]

Without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Possible words:
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).
- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.
- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.
- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.

We can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.

Another: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E's? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.

We cannot use E in position 1.

So let's choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.

""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.
""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.
""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.
""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.

S is a very common letter, so it's good to test S.

Also, L and D are common.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.

Alternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.

How about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

So I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven't tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it's more common? Or we can test both?

We can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don't have a good word without absent letters.

For example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".

If we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it's hard.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

So I think we should go with ""LIVES"".

But let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: 
- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.
- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.
- ""VIENS"" -> not common.

So probably E is in position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.

But ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.

So I'll go with ""LIVES"".

But note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).

Also, we test L, V, S.

So let's choose ""LIVES"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.
Second guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.

So yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**: 
  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).
  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **I in position 2**.
- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).
- Exclude all absent letters.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:
- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).
- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.
- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

This guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.

Choose a word that includes E (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.\n 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.\n 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.\n\n Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.\n\n Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.\n\n We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).\n - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don\'t know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in a different position.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.\n\n But we can also consider other words.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: \n      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)\n\n But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But let\'s think of other options.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.\n\n Example: ""STOLE"" -> \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of E. So it\'s better to try E in a different position.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? \n   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? \n   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.\n\n But let\'s think of words that have E in the first position: \n   ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).\n\n Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has B, O, W, L.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.\n\n How about ""HOMES""? \n   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? \n   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": \n   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.\n\n We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.\n\n Since the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:\n\n - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n How about ""E"" followed by other letters? \n\n - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that\'s 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. \n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E\'s and two T\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.\n\n However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.\n\n How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if P, S, T, O are in the word.\n\n Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.\n\n We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don\'t know. So we can try.\n\n However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.\n\n But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' again and we know E is not at 4 either.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? \n\n Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:\n\n - ""E"" at position 1: \n   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.\n\n But we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n Let me consider ""EIGHT"": \n   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we have E in the first position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.\n\n But note: we have L at the end. We don\'t know about L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we have two common letters: S and T. \n\n Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). \n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:\n\n ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n Possible: \n   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.\n   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. \n ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one \'-\' (for E) and then four new letters to test.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. \n The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.\n\n Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don\'t know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n But note: if we use a word with two E\'s, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E. It\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.\n\n Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? \n   This word: \n      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.\n\n But note: we have D at the end. \n\n We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? \n\n After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.\n\n But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at the beginning? We haven\'t tested the beginning.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? \n\n However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.\n\n I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that\'s the point: we are testing them.\n\n So let\'s go with ""EIGHT"".\n\n However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either \'-\' or if we are lucky, \'✓\') and also on I, G, H, T.\n\n But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n So let\'s choose ""EIGHT"".\n\n<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.\n- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""EIGHT""** fits well:\n- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).\n- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got \'-\' for E at position 1).\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n- G, H, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _\n\nAnd E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it\'s not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nSo the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it\'s present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has I in the second position.\n- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 1,2,5).\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider the positions:\n\nPosition 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nPosition 2: must be I (fixed).\nPosition 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.\nPosition 4: same as above.\nPosition 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).\n\nWe can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.\n\nFirst, let\'s try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _\nWe need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.\n\nAvailable for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _\nPossible words:\n- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: \n  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.\n\nBut wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.\n""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.\n""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. \n""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let\'s see.\n\nActually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.\n\nHow about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E\'s? The feedback might be tricky.\n\nBut note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.\n\nHowever, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E\'s? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get \'-\'. If the letter is not in the word, we get \'x\'. But if the word has two E\'s, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E\'s, then one of them might be \'-\' or \'x\' and the other might be \'x\' if the secret word has only one.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has one or two E\'s. So it might be risky.\n\nWe can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? \n  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.\n  - This uses L, V, S which are new.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.\n\nBut we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E\'s -> invalid because of C.\n\n""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4: \n- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": \n  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try E in position 3: \n- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? \n  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as \'-\' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be \'x\'. \n  - But if the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it might be messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.\n\nSo ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut ""BIKES"" has K and S. \n\nWe can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good candidate without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E\'s. Let\'s avoid.\n\nAnother word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.\n\n""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.\n\nBut J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". \n\nBut note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.\n\nThe absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo we might want to test O or U.\n\nBut in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? \n- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nSo ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let\'s check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.\n\nBut we have S at the end.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.\n\nSo the word must have I in the second position.\n\nTherefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith E in position 3 or 4.\n\nAnd without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- With E in position 3: \n  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.\n\nSo for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don\'t have many words with E in the middle? \n\nActually, it\'s hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.\n\nFor example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? \n\nLet me clarify: \n- Position 3: the third letter.\n\nSo for E in position 3: the third letter is E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.\n- ""MIELS"" -> not common? \n- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.\n\nTherefore, E is likely in position 4.\n\nSo we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven\'t tested position 3? Actually, we don\'t know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.\n\nWe can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.\n\nBut we also need to test position 1 and 5.\n\nWe have to choose a word that uses available letters.\n\nLet me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nWithout C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).\n- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.\n- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.\n- ""DICES"": invalid (C)\n- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.\n- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.\n- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.\n- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.\n\nAnother: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E\'s? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.\n\nWe cannot use E in position 1.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.\n\n""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.\n""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.\n""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.\n""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so it\'s good to test S.\n\nAlso, L and D are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.\n\nHow about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nSo I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it\'s more common? Or we can test both?\n\nWe can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good word without absent letters.\n\nFor example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".\n\nIf we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: \n- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.\n- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.\n- ""VIENS"" -> not common.\n\nSo probably E is in position 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.\n\nBut ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can\'t be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).\n\nAlso, we test L, V, S.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""LIVES"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.\nSecond guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").\n- **Present letters**: \n  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).\n  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **I in position 2**.\n- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).\n- Exclude all absent letters.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\n**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:\n- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).\n- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.\n- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.\n\nThis guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.\n\n<guess>lives</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
  - G, H, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).
  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).
  - S is in position 5 and correct.
  - L and V are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S

We also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

But we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

And we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.

We also know from previous feedback that:
- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it's in position 4, which matches.
- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as '-' or 'x' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked '✓', so it's correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked 'x', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked 'x', so L is absent.

But what about the third letter? We haven't tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.

We also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

Therefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked 'x', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.

Now, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

We can list possible words:

- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.

But we haven't tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.

But we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it's not in the absent list.

Similarly, we can think of other words.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven't tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.

But we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven't tested P.

But note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.

Another word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven't tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.

But let's list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S

Without using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Letter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.
- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.
- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked '✓', but that doesn't say anything about another S. However, we haven't tested S in other positions.

But note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S's, then we might have more information? But we don't have any other S in the guess.

So ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven't tested Z.

But let's see: the word would be S I Z E S. 
- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.
- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.

We can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.

We have to test the possibilities.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we don't have enough information about the first and third letters.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we can also try a word that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven't used.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

We haven't used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.

For example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.

But we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.

Or ""PIKES"": P and K.

But note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.

The word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.
- ""SIECES"": not 5.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.

We can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.

""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.

""JIVES"" invalid.

""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.

""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.

""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that's 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. 

""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.

""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.

We must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.

So the pattern is: ? I ? E S

Now, what words fit this pattern?

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Similarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.

But we have limited options.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don't use absent letters.

- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.
- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.
- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.
- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don't know if S is duplicated).

But note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked '✓' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don't know if S appears elsewhere.

Similarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

Actually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.

What about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.

So the third letter is the one before S.

Common words: 
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S

Also, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

So letter1 and letter3 are unknown.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.

But we have to test.

Since we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.

But we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

However, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But if we guess ""BIKES"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.

But we have to pick one.

Let me see which letters are more common.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.

Vowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.

What about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.

""UILES"" -> not a word.

So it's hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.

Therefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

We can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.

But let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we don't know.

Another idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven't tested them, so they are possible.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But let me see the frequency.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it's hard.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven't tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it's rare? Or is it? I think it's acceptable.

But we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.

Similarly, ""WIPES"" is common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.

Similarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check. If it's present but wrong position, we get '-'. If absent, we get 'x'.

But we are testing B and K.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

We know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.

So the word is: [1] I [3] E S

We have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).

So for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.

Common words:
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's)

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have much to go on.

We can try ""BIKES"".

If it's not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it's unlikely.

For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

""OILES"" has L -> invalid.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""

But wait, we have to write it.

So <guess>bikes</guess>

But let me double-check the pattern.

The secret word: _ I _ E S

We are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).

If the word is ""BIKES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.

Similarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don't know the position of K.

But we can then adjust.

So it's okay.

We can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**:
  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").
  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").
  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").
- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S

We need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).

**Key insights**:
- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.
- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.
- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".

After evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:
- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").

<guess>bikes</guess>",bikes,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
  - G, H, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).
  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).
  - S is in position 5 and correct.
  - L and V are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S

We also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

But we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

And we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.

We also know from previous feedback that:
- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it's in position 4, which matches.
- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as '-' or 'x' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked '✓', so it's correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked 'x', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked 'x', so L is absent.

But what about the third letter? We haven't tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.

We also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

Therefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked 'x', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.

Now, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

We can list possible words:

- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.

But we haven't tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.

But we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it's not in the absent list.

Similarly, we can think of other words.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven't tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.

But we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven't tested P.

But note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.

Another word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven't tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.

But let's list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S

Without using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Letter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.
- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.
- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked '✓', but that doesn't say anything about another S. However, we haven't tested S in other positions.

But note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S's, then we might have more information? But we don't have any other S in the guess.

So ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven't tested Z.

But let's see: the word would be S I Z E S. 
- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.
- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.

We can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.

We have to test the possibilities.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we don't have enough information about the first and third letters.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we can also try a word that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven't used.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

We haven't used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.

For example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.

But we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.

Or ""PIKES"": P and K.

But note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.

The word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.
- ""SIECES"": not 5.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.

We can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.

""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.

""JIVES"" invalid.

""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.

""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.

""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that's 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. 

""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.

""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.

We must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.

So the pattern is: ? I ? E S

Now, what words fit this pattern?

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Similarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.

But we have limited options.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don't use absent letters.

- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.
- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.
- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.
- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don't know if S is duplicated).

But note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked '✓' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don't know if S appears elsewhere.

Similarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

Actually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.

What about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.

So the third letter is the one before S.

Common words: 
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S

Also, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

So letter1 and letter3 are unknown.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.

But we have to test.

Since we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.

But we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

However, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But if we guess ""BIKES"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.

But we have to pick one.

Let me see which letters are more common.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.

Vowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.

What about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.

""UILES"" -> not a word.

So it's hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.

Therefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

We can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.

But let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we don't know.

Another idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven't tested them, so they are possible.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But let me see the frequency.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it's hard.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven't tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it's rare? Or is it? I think it's acceptable.

But we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.

Similarly, ""WIPES"" is common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.

Similarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check. If it's present but wrong position, we get '-'. If absent, we get 'x'.

But we are testing B and K.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

We know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.

So the word is: [1] I [3] E S

We have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).

So for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.

Common words:
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's)

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have much to go on.

We can try ""BIKES"".

If it's not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it's unlikely.

For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

""OILES"" has L -> invalid.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""

But wait, we have to write it.

So <guess>bikes</guess>

But let me double-check the pattern.

The secret word: _ I _ E S

We are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).

If the word is ""BIKES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.

Similarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don't know the position of K.

But we can then adjust.

So it's okay.

We can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**:
  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").
  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").
  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").
- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S

We need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).

**Key insights**:
- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.
- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.
- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".

After evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:
- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").",Guess 4: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.

 Example: ""STOLE"" -> 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as '-' again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of E. So it's better to try E in a different position.

 How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.

 How about ""SETUP""? 
   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? 
   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""? 
   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": 
   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.

 We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.

 Since the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:

 - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

This guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.

<guess>eight</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
- G, H, T are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _

And E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it's not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the second position.
- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the positions:

Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Position 2: must be I (fixed).
Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
Position 4: same as above.
Position 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).

We can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.

First, let's try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _
We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.

But we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _

We need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _
Possible words:
- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: 
  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.

But wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.

Another: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.
""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.
""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. 
""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let's see.

Actually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.

How about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E's? The feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.

However, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get '-'. If the letter is not in the word, we get 'x'. But if the word has two E's, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E's, then one of them might be '-' or 'x' and the other might be 'x' if the secret word has only one.

But we don't know if the secret word has one or two E's. So it might be risky.

We can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.

So let's try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _

Possible words:
- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? 
  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.
  - This uses L, V, S which are new.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.

Another: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.

But we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E's -> invalid because of C.

""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.

This is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes.

Another: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.

But we don't know if D is in the word.

We can also consider E in position 4: 
- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": 
  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we don't know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.

We can also try E in position 3: 
- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? 
  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as '-' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be 'x'. 
  - But if the secret word has two E's, then we might get two marks.

But we don't know, so it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.

So ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But ""BIKES"" has K and S. 

We can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without duplicates.

What about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E's. Let's avoid.

Another word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.

""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.

But J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.

Similarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

So invalid.

""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.

So let's stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".

We can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". 

But note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.

We can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.

The absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test O or U.

But in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). 

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? 
- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.

But we don't know if O is in the word.

Another: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? 

But we have to avoid T? Yes.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

So ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let's check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.

But we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.

Similarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.

But we have S at the end.

We can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.

So the word must have I in the second position.

Therefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With E in position 3 or 4.

And without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Let me list some words:

- With E in position 3: 
  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

So for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don't have many words with E in the middle? 

Actually, it's hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.

For example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? 

Let me clarify: 
- Position 3: the third letter.

So for E in position 3: the third letter is E.

Examples: 
- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.
- ""MIELS"" -> not common? 
- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.

Therefore, E is likely in position 4.

So we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven't tested position 3? Actually, we don't know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.

We can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.

But we also need to test position 1 and 5.

We have to choose a word that uses available letters.

Let me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]

Without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Possible words:
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).
- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.
- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.
- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.

We can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.

Another: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E's? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.

We cannot use E in position 1.

So let's choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.

""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.
""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.
""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.
""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.

S is a very common letter, so it's good to test S.

Also, L and D are common.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.

Alternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.

How about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

So I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven't tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it's more common? Or we can test both?

We can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don't have a good word without absent letters.

For example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".

If we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it's hard.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

So I think we should go with ""LIVES"".

But let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: 
- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.
- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.
- ""VIENS"" -> not common.

So probably E is in position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.

But ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.

So I'll go with ""LIVES"".

But note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).

Also, we test L, V, S.

So let's choose ""LIVES"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.
Second guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.

So yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**: 
  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).
  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **I in position 2**.
- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).
- Exclude all absent letters.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:
- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).
- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.
- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

This guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.

<guess>lives</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
  - G, H, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).
  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).
  - S is in position 5 and correct.
  - L and V are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S

We also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

But we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

And we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.

We also know from previous feedback that:
- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it's in position 4, which matches.
- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as '-' or 'x' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked '✓', so it's correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked 'x', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked 'x', so L is absent.

But what about the third letter? We haven't tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.

We also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

Therefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked 'x', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.

Now, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

We can list possible words:

- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.

But we haven't tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.

But we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it's not in the absent list.

Similarly, we can think of other words.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven't tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.

But we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven't tested P.

But note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.

Another word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven't tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.

But let's list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S

Without using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Letter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.
- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.
- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked '✓', but that doesn't say anything about another S. However, we haven't tested S in other positions.

But note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S's, then we might have more information? But we don't have any other S in the guess.

So ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven't tested Z.

But let's see: the word would be S I Z E S. 
- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.
- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.

We can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.

We have to test the possibilities.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we don't have enough information about the first and third letters.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we can also try a word that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven't used.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

We haven't used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.

For example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.

But we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.

Or ""PIKES"": P and K.

But note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.

The word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.
- ""SIECES"": not 5.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.

We can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.

""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.

""JIVES"" invalid.

""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.

""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.

""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that's 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. 

""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.

""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.

We must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.

So the pattern is: ? I ? E S

Now, what words fit this pattern?

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Similarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.

But we have limited options.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don't use absent letters.

- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.
- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.
- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.
- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don't know if S is duplicated).

But note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked '✓' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don't know if S appears elsewhere.

Similarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

Actually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.

What about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.

So the third letter is the one before S.

Common words: 
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S

Also, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

So letter1 and letter3 are unknown.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.

But we have to test.

Since we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.

But we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

However, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But if we guess ""BIKES"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.

But we have to pick one.

Let me see which letters are more common.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.

Vowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.

What about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.

""UILES"" -> not a word.

So it's hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.

Therefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

We can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.

But let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we don't know.

Another idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven't tested them, so they are possible.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But let me see the frequency.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it's hard.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven't tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it's rare? Or is it? I think it's acceptable.

But we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.

Similarly, ""WIPES"" is common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.

Similarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check. If it's present but wrong position, we get '-'. If absent, we get 'x'.

But we are testing B and K.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

We know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.

So the word is: [1] I [3] E S

We have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).

So for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.

Common words:
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's)

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have much to go on.

We can try ""BIKES"".

If it's not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it's unlikely.

For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

""OILES"" has L -> invalid.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""

But wait, we have to write it.

So <guess>bikes</guess>

But let me double-check the pattern.

The secret word: _ I _ E S

We are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).

If the word is ""BIKES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.

Similarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don't know the position of K.

But we can then adjust.

So it's okay.

We can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**:
  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").
  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").
  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").
- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S

We need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).

**Key insights**:
- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.
- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.
- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".

After evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:
- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").

Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in a different position.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.\n\n But we can also consider other words.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: \n      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)\n\n But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But let\'s think of other options.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.\n\n Example: ""STOLE"" -> \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of E. So it\'s better to try E in a different position.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? \n   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? \n   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.\n\n But let\'s think of words that have E in the first position: \n   ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).\n\n Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has B, O, W, L.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.\n\n How about ""HOMES""? \n   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? \n   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": \n   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.\n\n We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.\n\n Since the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:\n\n - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n How about ""E"" followed by other letters? \n\n - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that\'s 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. \n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E\'s and two T\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.\n\n However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.\n\n How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if P, S, T, O are in the word.\n\n Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.\n\n We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don\'t know. So we can try.\n\n However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.\n\n But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' again and we know E is not at 4 either.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? \n\n Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:\n\n - ""E"" at position 1: \n   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.\n\n But we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n Let me consider ""EIGHT"": \n   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we have E in the first position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.\n\n But note: we have L at the end. We don\'t know about L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we have two common letters: S and T. \n\n Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). \n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:\n\n ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n Possible: \n   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.\n   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. \n ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one \'-\' (for E) and then four new letters to test.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. \n The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.\n\n Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don\'t know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n But note: if we use a word with two E\'s, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E. It\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.\n\n Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? \n   This word: \n      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.\n\n But note: we have D at the end. \n\n We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? \n\n After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.\n\n But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at the beginning? We haven\'t tested the beginning.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? \n\n However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.\n\n I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that\'s the point: we are testing them.\n\n So let\'s go with ""EIGHT"".\n\n However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either \'-\' or if we are lucky, \'✓\') and also on I, G, H, T.\n\n But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n So let\'s choose ""EIGHT"".\n\n<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.\n- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""EIGHT""** fits well:\n- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).\n- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got \'-\' for E at position 1).\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n- G, H, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _\n\nAnd E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it\'s not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nSo the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it\'s present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has I in the second position.\n- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 1,2,5).\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider the positions:\n\nPosition 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nPosition 2: must be I (fixed).\nPosition 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.\nPosition 4: same as above.\nPosition 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).\n\nWe can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.\n\nFirst, let\'s try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _\nWe need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.\n\nAvailable for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _\nPossible words:\n- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: \n  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.\n\nBut wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.\n""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.\n""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. \n""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let\'s see.\n\nActually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.\n\nHow about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E\'s? The feedback might be tricky.\n\nBut note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.\n\nHowever, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E\'s? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get \'-\'. If the letter is not in the word, we get \'x\'. But if the word has two E\'s, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E\'s, then one of them might be \'-\' or \'x\' and the other might be \'x\' if the secret word has only one.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has one or two E\'s. So it might be risky.\n\nWe can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? \n  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.\n  - This uses L, V, S which are new.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.\n\nBut we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E\'s -> invalid because of C.\n\n""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4: \n- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": \n  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try E in position 3: \n- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? \n  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as \'-\' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be \'x\'. \n  - But if the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it might be messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.\n\nSo ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut ""BIKES"" has K and S. \n\nWe can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good candidate without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E\'s. Let\'s avoid.\n\nAnother word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.\n\n""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.\n\nBut J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". \n\nBut note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.\n\nThe absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo we might want to test O or U.\n\nBut in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? \n- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nSo ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let\'s check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.\n\nBut we have S at the end.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.\n\nSo the word must have I in the second position.\n\nTherefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith E in position 3 or 4.\n\nAnd without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- With E in position 3: \n  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.\n\nSo for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don\'t have many words with E in the middle? \n\nActually, it\'s hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.\n\nFor example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? \n\nLet me clarify: \n- Position 3: the third letter.\n\nSo for E in position 3: the third letter is E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.\n- ""MIELS"" -> not common? \n- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.\n\nTherefore, E is likely in position 4.\n\nSo we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven\'t tested position 3? Actually, we don\'t know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.\n\nWe can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.\n\nBut we also need to test position 1 and 5.\n\nWe have to choose a word that uses available letters.\n\nLet me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nWithout C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).\n- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.\n- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.\n- ""DICES"": invalid (C)\n- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.\n- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.\n- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.\n- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.\n\nAnother: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E\'s? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.\n\nWe cannot use E in position 1.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.\n\n""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.\n""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.\n""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.\n""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so it\'s good to test S.\n\nAlso, L and D are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.\n\nHow about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nSo I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it\'s more common? Or we can test both?\n\nWe can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good word without absent letters.\n\nFor example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".\n\nIf we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: \n- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.\n- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.\n- ""VIENS"" -> not common.\n\nSo probably E is in position 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.\n\nBut ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can\'t be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).\n\nAlso, we test L, V, S.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""LIVES"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.\nSecond guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").\n- **Present letters**: \n  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).\n  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **I in position 2**.\n- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).\n- Exclude all absent letters.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\n**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:\n- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).\n- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.\n- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.\n\nThis guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.\n\n<guess>lives</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\n  - I is in position 2 (correct).\n  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got \'-\' for E at position 1).\n  - G, H, T are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)\n  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).\n  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).\n  - S is in position 5 and correct.\n  - L and V are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has: \n  - Position 2: I\n  - Position 4: E\n  - Position 5: S\n- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S\n\nWe also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.\n\nBut we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nAnd we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nNow, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.\n\nWe also know from previous feedback that:\n- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it\'s in position 4, which matches.\n- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as \'-\' or \'x\' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked \'✓\', so it\'s correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a \'-\' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked \'x\', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked \'x\', so L is absent.\n\nBut what about the third letter? We haven\'t tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.\n\nWe also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nTherefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a \'-\' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked \'x\', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.\n\nNow, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.\n\nBut we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it\'s not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, we can think of other words.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.\n- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.\n- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.\n- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven\'t tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.\n\nBut we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven\'t tested P.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven\'t tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nWithout using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nSo letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLetter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.\n- ""DICES"": invalid (C)\n- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)\n- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.\n- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.\n- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked \'✓\', but that doesn\'t say anything about another S. However, we haven\'t tested S in other positions.\n\nBut note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S\'s, then we might have more information? But we don\'t have any other S in the guess.\n\nSo ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven\'t tested Z.\n\nBut let\'s see: the word would be S I Z E S. \n- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.\n- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.\n\nWe have to test the possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.\n\nWe can try to guess the word directly.\n\nBut we don\'t have enough information about the first and third letters.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we can also try a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven\'t used.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe haven\'t used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nFor example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.\n\nBut we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.\n\nOr ""PIKES"": P and K.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.\n\nThe word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""IDES"": but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.\n- ""SIECES"": not 5.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.\n\nWe can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.\n\n""JIVES"" invalid.\n\n""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.\n\n""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that\'s 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. \n\n""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.\n\n""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.\n\nWe must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nSo the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.\n\nSo the pattern is: ? I ? E S\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.\n\nBut we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nBut we have limited options.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don\'t use absent letters.\n\n- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.\n- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.\n- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.\n- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.\n- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don\'t know if S is duplicated).\n\nBut note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked \'✓\' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don\'t know if S appears elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nNow, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.\n\nActually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.\n\nWhat about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.\n\nWe need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.\n\nSo the third letter is the one before S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S\n\nAlso, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.\n""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nWe must have I at position 2.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nSo letter1 and letter3 are unknown.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nSince we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.\n\nBut we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.\n\nHowever, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut if we guess ""BIKES"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nLet me see which letters are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.\n\nVowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""UILES"" -> not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nWe can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.\n\nBut let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven\'t tested them, so they are possible.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.\n\nBut let me see the frequency.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" is invalid.\n\n""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven\'t tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it\'s rare? Or is it? I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIPES"" is common.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.\n\nIf the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it\'s correct, we get a check. If it\'s present but wrong position, we get \'-\'. If absent, we get \'x\'.\n\nBut we are testing B and K.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nWe know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.\n\nSo the word is: [1] I [3] E S\n\nWe have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).\n\nSo for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s)\n\nBut we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.\n\nBut we are trying to find the word.\n\nWe can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.\n\n""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"".\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it\'s unlikely.\n\nFor example, ""IXES"" is not a word.\n\n""OILES"" has L -> invalid.\n\nSo I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""\n\nBut wait, we have to write it.\n\nSo <guess>bikes</guess>\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern.\n\nThe secret word: _ I _ E S\n\nWe are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).\n\nIf the word is ""BIKES"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nBut if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don\'t know the position of K.\n\nBut we can then adjust.\n\nSo it\'s okay.\n\nWe can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nBut I think ""BIKES"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").\n- **Present letters**:\n  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").\n  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").\n  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").\n- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).\n\n**Key insights**:\n- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.\n- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.\n- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".\n\nAfter evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:\n- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).\n- It avoids all absent letters.\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").\n\n<guess>bikes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in 5, from guess 1).
  - G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - L and V are absent.

Guess 4: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is still in position 4 (correct).
  - S is still in position 5 (correct).
  - B and K are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ I _ E S
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K
- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we have to avoid the absent letters).

But we also know that the third letter cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in previous guesses, when we had E in position 3? We don't have a guess with E in position 3. In ""lives"", we had E in position 4, not 3. In ""bikes"", we had E in position 4 again.

We never tested E in position 3. But we know E is in the word and at position 4. It's possible that there is only one E? Or two? But we don't have evidence of two E's.

However, we can consider that the third letter might be E? But if the third letter were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. But if E were also at position 3, then in ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct) and the E at position 3 in the secret word would not be represented in ""crane"" because we only had one E? But ""crane"" has one E. So if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct for E being present but not at 5) and there would be no feedback for position 3? Because we didn't guess E at position 3. So we don't know if E is at position 3.

But in ""lives"" and ""bikes"", we didn't have E at position 3. We had E at position 4.

So it's possible that E could be at position 3? But we have no evidence against it.

However, we have to consider that the third letter might be E? But then the word would be _ I E E S? That doesn't make sense because position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 4 must be E, and position 5 must be S. So the word would be _ I E E S.

But is there a word like that? For example, ""DIKES"" has E at position 3 and 4? But we have E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3, then we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

In the feedback for ""lives"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', and we didn't have any other E in the guess. Similarly, in ""bikes"", we only had one E.

But if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E only at position 5, the feedback for E would be '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. It doesn't tell us about position 3.

In ""lives"", we guessed V at position 3, which was absent, so if the secret word had E at position 3, then we would have no E at position 3 in the guess, so we don't know.

But we can try to test for E at position 3.

However, we are constrained by the pattern: the word must be _ I _ E S.

If we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? But that would be two E's? And position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 3 is E and position 4 is E? That would be two E's.

But is there a word like ""IIES""? No.

The pattern is fixed: position 4 is E, position 5 is S. So if we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? That doesn't form a word. Because position 4 would be E, and position 5 S, so position 3 must be E? Then the word would be _ I E E S. But is there any English word that ends with ""EES""? Not really. For example, ""TREES"" has R and T absent -> invalid. ""DREAMS"" is 6 letters. 

Actually, there are no common English words ending with ""EES"". So it's impossible for the pattern _ I E E S.

Therefore, the third letter cannot be E. So we can rule out that possibility.

Thus, the third letter must be a letter that is not E and not in the absent list.

So available letters for position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

And for position 1: same, except we must avoid the absent letters and E? But E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if position 1 were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' (present but not at 5). But if E were at position 1, then in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 1 (we had C,R,A,N,E so E at 5 only). So it doesn't conflict.

But if the secret word had E at position 1, then in ""crane"", we would have E at position 5 and it would be marked as '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. But we don't have E at position 1 in ""crane"", so we don't know.

But we know E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? Actually, it could be. But if position 1 were E, then the word would be E I _ E S. Then the third letter must be a letter that is not absent and not E? But E is at position 1, so the third letter would be something else.

But we have to consider the possibility.

However, we can try to test for E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it would be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get clear feedback.

So we focus on words without E in position 1 or 3? Position 1: we are considering E? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try a word that has E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, then we have two E's? And we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we should not put E at position 1 because we know E is at position 4.

So we should avoid using E in position 1 or 3.

Therefore, for position 1, we use a letter that is not E and not absent. Similarly for position 3.

So available letters for position 1: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we cannot use E because E is at position 4).

Now, we need to form a word: [1] I [3] E S

We can try:

- ""D I _ E S""

What letters can we put in position 3? We have the available letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""D I M E S"" -> ""DIMES"": but M is available, but ""DIMES"" is D-I-M-E-S -> so position 3 is M.

But we haven't tested M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" -> ""DIPES"": not a common word? ""DIPES"" is not standard. 
""DIVES"": D I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
""DIKES"": D I K E S -> K is absent (from guess 4) -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So ""DIMES"": D I M E S -> valid word? Yes, meaning coins or dimples? It's accepted in word games sometimes.

But let's see if it fits: 
- Position 1: D, 2: I, 3: M, 4: E, 5: S.

This tests D and M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" is not a word.

""J I _ E S"": 
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""JIMES"": J I M E S -> tests J and M. ""JIMES"" is not common? ""Jimes"" is not a standard word. 
""JUMPS"": doesn't end with ES.

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F ILES"": F I L E S -> L absent -> invalid.
- ""F IES"" is 4 letters.
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": not common? ""Fides"" is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? That would be ""FIDES"", which is a valid word (plural of fides? not common). 
But let's check: ""FIDES"" is accepted in Wordle? I think it is.

But we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available? Yes, D is not absent.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""M I _ E S"": 
- ""M ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""M I D E S"" -> ""MIDES"": valid word (plural of mide? not common, but accepted in Wordle). 
- ""M I P E S"" -> ""MIPES"": not a word.
- ""M I Z E S"" -> ""MIZES"": not common.

""O I _ E S"":
- ""O ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""O I D E S"" -> ""OIDES"": not common.
- ""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.
- ""O I Z E S"" -> ""OIZES"": not common.

""W I _ E S"":
- ""W I P E S"" -> ""WIPES"": valid word.
- ""W I D E S"" -> ""WIDES"": not common.
- ""W I K E S"" -> K absent -> invalid (from guess 4).

""PI I _ E S"": 
- ""PI I E S"" -> ""PIES"": 4 letters.
- ""PI I D E S"" -> ""PIDES"": not common.
- ""PI I M E S"" -> ""PIMES"": not a word.
- ""PI I Z E S"" -> ""PIZES"": not common.

""J I _ E S"":
- ""J I V E S"" -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""J I M E S"" -> ""JIMES"": not common.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": valid? F-I-D-E-S? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""FIDES"" is 5 letters: F-I-D-E-S? No, F-I-D-E-S is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? Actually, it's F-I-D-E-S? That's 5: F, I, D, E, S. But ""FIDES"" is usually spelled F-I-D-E-S? I think it's accepted.

But let's check the dictionary: ""Fides"" is not common, but ""FIDES"" might be accepted as a variant of ""fides"" (plural of fidel). But we can use ""FIDES"".

However, we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> valid? Yes, meaning sidewalks or city blocks? It's accepted.

But we have to choose.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S -> tests D and M.

Or ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> tests M and D.

We can also try ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.

How about ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""BIKES"": but B and K are absent -> invalid.

So we have a few candidates: ""DIMES"", ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", etc.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I and E, so it might be a consonant.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""D I E E S"" -> but that would be ""DIES"" with an extra E? Not a word.

So I think we should try ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S.

But ""DIMES"" is less common.

""WIPES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""MIDES"" is common.

But let me check: we have not used P, W, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

If we guess ""WIPES"", we test W at position 1 and P at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"", we test D and M.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

But we have to test.

Since we have only two possibilities? Actually, many.

But we can list:

Possible words: 
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""FIDES"": F I D E S (if accepted)
- ""DIMES"": D I M E S
- ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.
- ""BIKES"": B and K absent -> invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, Z is less common.

But ""SIZES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""S I Z E S"" is a word.

But we have to consider that.

We can also try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the frequency.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is more common.

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But we have to pick one.

Since we have multiple options, we can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""WIPES"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use a letter that is not absent.

But we don't have many choices.

Another word: ""O I _ E S""? ""O ILES"" has L -> invalid.

""Q I _ E S"": ""Q I P E S"" -> ""QUIPS"" -> not ending with ES? ""QUIPS"" ends with PS.

We need to end with ES.

""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.

So I think the main candidates are ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""DIMES"", ""SIZES"", etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""WIPES"":
- If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have such a word.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is a good choice because W and P are common.

But let me check: we have not used W, P, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

If we guess ""WIPES"" and it's not the word, then we know:
- If W is absent, then the word must be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If P is absent, then it could be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If both W and P are absent, then we have ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"" and it's not, then we know D and M are absent? Or at least, if D and M are absent, then it must be ""WIPES"" or ""SIZES"".

But if D and M are absent, then ""WIPES"" is a candidate.

So let's choose ""WIPES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing ""DIMES"" or ""MIDES"".

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But I think ""WIPES"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to write it.

So <guess>wipes</guess>

But wait, we have to consider: the secret word might be ""SIZES"", but then we would have S at position 1. But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

In ""SIZES"", we have S at position 1 and 5. So if we guess ""SIZES"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓, else if S is only at position 5, we get - (if S is in the word but not at 1), but we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1 and the secret word has only one S, then we would get x for position 1, and then we know S is at position 5.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can try ""SIZES"".

But it has Z, which is rare.

We can avoid and try ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

I think ""WIPES"" is better.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is _ I _ E S (position 2: I, position 4: E, position 5: S).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K (all marked ""x"" at some point).
- **E constraints**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"", ""eight"", and ""lives"" feedback). Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 4 is now confirmed as E, so E must be in position 3. But position 3 cannot be E because:
  - If E were in position 3, the word would be _ I E E S. However, no common English word ends with ""EES"" (e.g., ""TREES"" has absent letters).
  - Moreover, in ""lives"" (Guess 3), we had E in position 4 (correct) and no E in position 3, so we never tested position 3 directly.

- **Third position constraints**: Must be a letter not in {C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, E} (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- **First position constraints**: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not E (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the pattern _ I _ E S, the most common valid words are:
- **WIPES** (W I P E S): Tests W and P.
- **MIDES** (M I D E S): Tests M and D.
- **DIMES** (D I M E S): Tests D and M.
- **SIZES** (S I Z E S): Tests S and Z (but S is already known to be in position 5, so if S is in position 1, it would be a duplicate; Z is uncommon).

**Strategy**: Prioritize **""WIPES""** because:
- It tests two new common letters: **W** (position 1) and **P** (position 3).
- It avoids rare letters (Z in ""SIZES"").
- If correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on W and P will confirm if they are present or absent, narrowing options to ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" for the next guess.

<guess>wipes</guess>",wipes,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in 5, from guess 1).
  - G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - L and V are absent.

Guess 4: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is still in position 4 (correct).
  - S is still in position 5 (correct).
  - B and K are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ I _ E S
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K
- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we have to avoid the absent letters).

But we also know that the third letter cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in previous guesses, when we had E in position 3? We don't have a guess with E in position 3. In ""lives"", we had E in position 4, not 3. In ""bikes"", we had E in position 4 again.

We never tested E in position 3. But we know E is in the word and at position 4. It's possible that there is only one E? Or two? But we don't have evidence of two E's.

However, we can consider that the third letter might be E? But if the third letter were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. But if E were also at position 3, then in ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct) and the E at position 3 in the secret word would not be represented in ""crane"" because we only had one E? But ""crane"" has one E. So if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct for E being present but not at 5) and there would be no feedback for position 3? Because we didn't guess E at position 3. So we don't know if E is at position 3.

But in ""lives"" and ""bikes"", we didn't have E at position 3. We had E at position 4.

So it's possible that E could be at position 3? But we have no evidence against it.

However, we have to consider that the third letter might be E? But then the word would be _ I E E S? That doesn't make sense because position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 4 must be E, and position 5 must be S. So the word would be _ I E E S.

But is there a word like that? For example, ""DIKES"" has E at position 3 and 4? But we have E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3, then we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

In the feedback for ""lives"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', and we didn't have any other E in the guess. Similarly, in ""bikes"", we only had one E.

But if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E only at position 5, the feedback for E would be '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. It doesn't tell us about position 3.

In ""lives"", we guessed V at position 3, which was absent, so if the secret word had E at position 3, then we would have no E at position 3 in the guess, so we don't know.

But we can try to test for E at position 3.

However, we are constrained by the pattern: the word must be _ I _ E S.

If we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? But that would be two E's? And position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 3 is E and position 4 is E? That would be two E's.

But is there a word like ""IIES""? No.

The pattern is fixed: position 4 is E, position 5 is S. So if we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? That doesn't form a word. Because position 4 would be E, and position 5 S, so position 3 must be E? Then the word would be _ I E E S. But is there any English word that ends with ""EES""? Not really. For example, ""TREES"" has R and T absent -> invalid. ""DREAMS"" is 6 letters. 

Actually, there are no common English words ending with ""EES"". So it's impossible for the pattern _ I E E S.

Therefore, the third letter cannot be E. So we can rule out that possibility.

Thus, the third letter must be a letter that is not E and not in the absent list.

So available letters for position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

And for position 1: same, except we must avoid the absent letters and E? But E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if position 1 were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' (present but not at 5). But if E were at position 1, then in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 1 (we had C,R,A,N,E so E at 5 only). So it doesn't conflict.

But if the secret word had E at position 1, then in ""crane"", we would have E at position 5 and it would be marked as '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. But we don't have E at position 1 in ""crane"", so we don't know.

But we know E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? Actually, it could be. But if position 1 were E, then the word would be E I _ E S. Then the third letter must be a letter that is not absent and not E? But E is at position 1, so the third letter would be something else.

But we have to consider the possibility.

However, we can try to test for E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it would be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get clear feedback.

So we focus on words without E in position 1 or 3? Position 1: we are considering E? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try a word that has E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, then we have two E's? And we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we should not put E at position 1 because we know E is at position 4.

So we should avoid using E in position 1 or 3.

Therefore, for position 1, we use a letter that is not E and not absent. Similarly for position 3.

So available letters for position 1: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we cannot use E because E is at position 4).

Now, we need to form a word: [1] I [3] E S

We can try:

- ""D I _ E S""

What letters can we put in position 3? We have the available letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""D I M E S"" -> ""DIMES"": but M is available, but ""DIMES"" is D-I-M-E-S -> so position 3 is M.

But we haven't tested M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" -> ""DIPES"": not a common word? ""DIPES"" is not standard. 
""DIVES"": D I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
""DIKES"": D I K E S -> K is absent (from guess 4) -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So ""DIMES"": D I M E S -> valid word? Yes, meaning coins or dimples? It's accepted in word games sometimes.

But let's see if it fits: 
- Position 1: D, 2: I, 3: M, 4: E, 5: S.

This tests D and M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" is not a word.

""J I _ E S"": 
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""JIMES"": J I M E S -> tests J and M. ""JIMES"" is not common? ""Jimes"" is not a standard word. 
""JUMPS"": doesn't end with ES.

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F ILES"": F I L E S -> L absent -> invalid.
- ""F IES"" is 4 letters.
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": not common? ""Fides"" is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? That would be ""FIDES"", which is a valid word (plural of fides? not common). 
But let's check: ""FIDES"" is accepted in Wordle? I think it is.

But we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available? Yes, D is not absent.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""M I _ E S"": 
- ""M ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""M I D E S"" -> ""MIDES"": valid word (plural of mide? not common, but accepted in Wordle). 
- ""M I P E S"" -> ""MIPES"": not a word.
- ""M I Z E S"" -> ""MIZES"": not common.

""O I _ E S"":
- ""O ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""O I D E S"" -> ""OIDES"": not common.
- ""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.
- ""O I Z E S"" -> ""OIZES"": not common.

""W I _ E S"":
- ""W I P E S"" -> ""WIPES"": valid word.
- ""W I D E S"" -> ""WIDES"": not common.
- ""W I K E S"" -> K absent -> invalid (from guess 4).

""PI I _ E S"": 
- ""PI I E S"" -> ""PIES"": 4 letters.
- ""PI I D E S"" -> ""PIDES"": not common.
- ""PI I M E S"" -> ""PIMES"": not a word.
- ""PI I Z E S"" -> ""PIZES"": not common.

""J I _ E S"":
- ""J I V E S"" -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""J I M E S"" -> ""JIMES"": not common.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": valid? F-I-D-E-S? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""FIDES"" is 5 letters: F-I-D-E-S? No, F-I-D-E-S is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? Actually, it's F-I-D-E-S? That's 5: F, I, D, E, S. But ""FIDES"" is usually spelled F-I-D-E-S? I think it's accepted.

But let's check the dictionary: ""Fides"" is not common, but ""FIDES"" might be accepted as a variant of ""fides"" (plural of fidel). But we can use ""FIDES"".

However, we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> valid? Yes, meaning sidewalks or city blocks? It's accepted.

But we have to choose.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S -> tests D and M.

Or ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> tests M and D.

We can also try ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.

How about ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""BIKES"": but B and K are absent -> invalid.

So we have a few candidates: ""DIMES"", ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", etc.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I and E, so it might be a consonant.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""D I E E S"" -> but that would be ""DIES"" with an extra E? Not a word.

So I think we should try ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S.

But ""DIMES"" is less common.

""WIPES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""MIDES"" is common.

But let me check: we have not used P, W, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

If we guess ""WIPES"", we test W at position 1 and P at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"", we test D and M.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

But we have to test.

Since we have only two possibilities? Actually, many.

But we can list:

Possible words: 
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""FIDES"": F I D E S (if accepted)
- ""DIMES"": D I M E S
- ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.
- ""BIKES"": B and K absent -> invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, Z is less common.

But ""SIZES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""S I Z E S"" is a word.

But we have to consider that.

We can also try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the frequency.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is more common.

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But we have to pick one.

Since we have multiple options, we can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""WIPES"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use a letter that is not absent.

But we don't have many choices.

Another word: ""O I _ E S""? ""O ILES"" has L -> invalid.

""Q I _ E S"": ""Q I P E S"" -> ""QUIPS"" -> not ending with ES? ""QUIPS"" ends with PS.

We need to end with ES.

""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.

So I think the main candidates are ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""DIMES"", ""SIZES"", etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""WIPES"":
- If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have such a word.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is a good choice because W and P are common.

But let me check: we have not used W, P, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

If we guess ""WIPES"" and it's not the word, then we know:
- If W is absent, then the word must be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If P is absent, then it could be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If both W and P are absent, then we have ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"" and it's not, then we know D and M are absent? Or at least, if D and M are absent, then it must be ""WIPES"" or ""SIZES"".

But if D and M are absent, then ""WIPES"" is a candidate.

So let's choose ""WIPES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing ""DIMES"" or ""MIDES"".

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But I think ""WIPES"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to write it.

So <guess>wipes</guess>

But wait, we have to consider: the secret word might be ""SIZES"", but then we would have S at position 1. But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

In ""SIZES"", we have S at position 1 and 5. So if we guess ""SIZES"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓, else if S is only at position 5, we get - (if S is in the word but not at 1), but we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1 and the secret word has only one S, then we would get x for position 1, and then we know S is at position 5.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can try ""SIZES"".

But it has Z, which is rare.

We can avoid and try ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

I think ""WIPES"" is better.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is _ I _ E S (position 2: I, position 4: E, position 5: S).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K (all marked ""x"" at some point).
- **E constraints**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"", ""eight"", and ""lives"" feedback). Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 4 is now confirmed as E, so E must be in position 3. But position 3 cannot be E because:
  - If E were in position 3, the word would be _ I E E S. However, no common English word ends with ""EES"" (e.g., ""TREES"" has absent letters).
  - Moreover, in ""lives"" (Guess 3), we had E in position 4 (correct) and no E in position 3, so we never tested position 3 directly.

- **Third position constraints**: Must be a letter not in {C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, E} (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- **First position constraints**: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not E (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the pattern _ I _ E S, the most common valid words are:
- **WIPES** (W I P E S): Tests W and P.
- **MIDES** (M I D E S): Tests M and D.
- **DIMES** (D I M E S): Tests D and M.
- **SIZES** (S I Z E S): Tests S and Z (but S is already known to be in position 5, so if S is in position 1, it would be a duplicate; Z is uncommon).

**Strategy**: Prioritize **""WIPES""** because:
- It tests two new common letters: **W** (position 1) and **P** (position 3).
- It avoids rare letters (Z in ""SIZES"").
- If correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on W and P will confirm if they are present or absent, narrowing options to ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" for the next guess.",Guess 5: wipes -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should:
 1. Choose a word that includes E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.
 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.

 Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.

 Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.

 We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that:
 - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don't know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, we should try E in a different position.

 Let's try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.

 But we can also consider other words.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: 
      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)

 But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.

 However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.

 But let's think of other options.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven't tried.

 We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

 We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.

 Example: ""STOLE"" -> 
   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as '-' again. But that doesn't give us new information about the position of E. So it's better to try E in a different position.

 How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.

 How about ""SETUP""? 
   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? 
   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.

 But let's think of words that have E in the first position: 
   ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).

 Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.

 But we don't know if the word has B, O, W, L.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.

 How about ""HOMES""? 
   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? 
   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": 
   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.

 We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.

 Since the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:

 - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).

 So we must avoid N.

 How about ""E"" followed by other letters? 

 - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _
   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that's 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. 
   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if B, L, O, W are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E's and two T's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.

 However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.

 How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? 
   But we don't know if P, S, T, O are in the word.

 Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.

 We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don't know. So we can try.

 However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.

 But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' again and we know E is not at 4 either.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? 

 Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:

 - ""E"" at position 1: 
   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.

 But we also want to cover more common letters.

 Let me consider ""EIGHT"": 
   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.

 However, we have E in the first position. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.

 So we must avoid R.

 Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? 
   This word: 
      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)

 We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.

 But note: we have L at the end. We don't know about L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": 
   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.

 But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don't know about position 4. So it's okay.

 However, we have two common letters: S and T. 

 Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). 

 Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:

 ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. 
 Possible: 
   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.
   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.

 But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. 
 ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.

 Which one is better? 

 We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one '-' (for E) and then four new letters to test.

 We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. 
 The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.

 But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.

 We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.

 Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don't know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.

 But note: if we use a word with two E's, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don't know if there is a second E. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.

 Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.

 How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? 
   This word: 
      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)

 We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.

 But note: we have D at the end. 

 We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? 

 After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.

 But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at the beginning? We haven't tested the beginning.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? 

 However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.

 I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that's the point: we are testing them.

 So let's go with ""EIGHT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""

 We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either '-' or if we are lucky, '✓') and also on I, G, H, T.

 But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

 So let's choose ""EIGHT"".

<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.
- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.

The word **""EIGHT""** fits well:
- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).
- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.

This guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.

<guess>eight</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
Meaning:
- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).
- G, H, T are not in the word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T
Present letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _

And E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it's not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

So the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it's present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the second position.
- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.

We also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.

Let's consider the positions:

Position 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Position 2: must be I (fixed).
Position 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
Position 4: same as above.
Position 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).

We can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.

First, let's try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _
We need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.

But we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _

We need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some candidate words:

Option 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _
Possible words:
- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: 
  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.

But wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.

Another: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.
""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.
""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. 
""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let's see.

Actually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.

How about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E's? The feedback might be tricky.

But note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.

However, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E's? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get '-'. If the letter is not in the word, we get 'x'. But if the word has two E's, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as '-' or 'x'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E's, then one of them might be '-' or 'x' and the other might be 'x' if the secret word has only one.

But we don't know if the secret word has one or two E's. So it might be risky.

We can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.

So let's try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.

Alternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _

Possible words:
- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? 
  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.
  - This uses L, V, S which are new.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.

Another: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.

But we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E's -> invalid because of C.

""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.

This is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.

But note: we have to avoid T? Yes.

Another: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.

But we don't know if D is in the word.

We can also consider E in position 4: 
- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": 
  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we don't know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.

We can also try E in position 3: 
- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? 
  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as '-' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be 'x'. 
  - But if the secret word has two E's, then we might get two marks.

But we don't know, so it might be messy.

To avoid confusion, let's try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.

So ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.

Similarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.

But ""BIKES"" has K and S. 

We can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.

But we have to choose one.

We also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don't have a good candidate without duplicates.

What about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E's. Let's avoid.

Another word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.

""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.

But J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.

Similarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.

So invalid.

""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.

So let's stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".

We can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". 

But note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.

We can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.

The absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.

So we might want to test O or U.

But in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). 

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? 
- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.

This is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.

But we don't know if O is in the word.

Another: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? 

But we have to avoid T? Yes.

But note: we have to make sure we don't use absent letters.

So ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let's check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.

But we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.

Similarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.

But we have S at the end.

We can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? 
- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.

So the word must have I in the second position.

Therefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With E in position 3 or 4.

And without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Let me list some words:

- With E in position 3: 
  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

So for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don't have many words with E in the middle? 

Actually, it's hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.

For example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? 

Let me clarify: 
- Position 3: the third letter.

So for E in position 3: the third letter is E.

Examples: 
- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.
- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.
- ""MIELS"" -> not common? 
- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.

Therefore, E is likely in position 4.

So we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven't tested position 3? Actually, we don't know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.

We can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.

But we also need to test position 1 and 5.

We have to choose a word that uses available letters.

Let me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]

Without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.

Possible words:
- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).
- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.
- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.
- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.

We can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.

Another: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E's? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.

We cannot use E in position 1.

So let's choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.

We want to test as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.

""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.
""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.
""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.
""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.

S is a very common letter, so it's good to test S.

Also, L and D are common.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.

But let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.

Alternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.

Another word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.

How about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

So I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.

But wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven't tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it's more common? Or we can test both?

We can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don't have a good word without absent letters.

For example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".

If we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.

So it's hard.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

So I think we should go with ""LIVES"".

But let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: 
- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.
- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.
- ""VIENS"" -> not common.

So probably E is in position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.

But ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.

Similarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.

So I'll go with ""LIVES"".

But note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a '-' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).

Also, we test L, V, S.

So let's choose ""LIVES"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.
Second guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.

So yes.

So <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**: 
  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).
  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **I in position 2**.
- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).
- Exclude all absent letters.

For the next guess:
- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters.

**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:
- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).
- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.
- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.

This guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.

<guess>lives</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for E at position 1).
  - G, H, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).
  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).
  - S is in position 5 and correct.
  - L and V are not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S

We also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.

But we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

And we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.

We also know from previous feedback that:
- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it's in position 4, which matches.
- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as '-' or 'x' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked '-' meaning it's present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked '✓', so it's correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked 'x', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked 'x', so L is absent.

But what about the third letter? We haven't tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.

We also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

Therefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a '-' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked 'x', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.

Now, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

We can list possible words:

- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.

But we haven't tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.

But we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it's not in the absent list.

Similarly, we can think of other words.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Other possibilities:
- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.
- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.
- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven't tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.

But we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven't tested P.

But note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.

Another word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven't tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.

But let's list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S

Without using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.

So letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Letter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.
- ""DICES"": invalid (C)
- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.
- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.
- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked '✓', but that doesn't say anything about another S. However, we haven't tested S in other positions.

But note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S's, then we might have more information? But we don't have any other S in the guess.

So ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven't tested Z.

But let's see: the word would be S I Z E S. 
- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.
- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.

We can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.

We have to test the possibilities.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.

We can try to guess the word directly.

But we don't have enough information about the first and third letters.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we can also try a word that uses more common letters.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven't used.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

We haven't used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.

For example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.

But we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.

Or ""PIKES"": P and K.

But note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.

The word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.

Possible words:

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"": but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.
- ""SIECES"": not 5.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.

We can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.

""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.

""JIVES"" invalid.

""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.

""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.

""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that's 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. 

""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.

""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.

We must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.

So the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.

So the pattern is: ? I ? E S

Now, what words fit this pattern?

- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Similarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.

But we have limited options.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don't use absent letters.

- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.
- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.
- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.
- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.
- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don't know if S is duplicated).

But note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked '✓' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don't know if S appears elsewhere.

Similarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.

Now, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven't tested.

We can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

Actually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.

What about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.

We need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.

So the third letter is the one before S.

Common words: 
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S

Also, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

So letter1 and letter3 are unknown.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.

But we have to test.

Since we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.

But we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.

However, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.

But if we guess ""BIKES"" and it's not the word, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.

But we have to pick one.

Let me see which letters are more common.

Common consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.

Vowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.

What about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.

""UILES"" -> not a word.

So it's hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.

Therefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".

But we have to avoid using too many rare letters.

We can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.

But let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.

We can try ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we don't know.

Another idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven't tested them, so they are possible.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But let me see the frequency.

We can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it's hard.

Another word: ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven't tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it's rare? Or is it? I think it's acceptable.

But we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.

But let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.

Similarly, ""WIPES"" is common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But we have to avoid the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.

Similarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it's correct, we get a check. If it's present but wrong position, we get '-'. If absent, we get 'x'.

But we are testing B and K.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

We know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.

So the word is: [1] I [3] E S

We have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).

So for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.

Common words:
- ""BIKES"": B I K E S
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""PIKES"": P I K E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's)

But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.

""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.

I think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with that.

But let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have much to go on.

We can try ""BIKES"".

If it's not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.

So let's choose ""BIKES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it's unlikely.

For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.

""OILES"" has L -> invalid.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""

But wait, we have to write it.

So <guess>bikes</guess>

But let me double-check the pattern.

The secret word: _ I _ E S

We are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).

If the word is ""BIKES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.

Similarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don't know the position of K.

But we can then adjust.

So it's okay.

We can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").
- **Present letters**:
  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").
  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").
  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").
- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).

The secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S

We need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).

**Key insights**:
- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.
- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.
- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".

After evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:
- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).
- It avoids all absent letters.
- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").

<guess>bikes</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)
Guess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(x) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in 5, from guess 1).
  - G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - L and V are absent.

Guess 4: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is still in position 2 (correct).
  - E is still in position 4 (correct).
  - S is still in position 5 (correct).
  - B and K are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ I _ E S
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K
- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we have to avoid the absent letters).

But we also know that the third letter cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in previous guesses, when we had E in position 3? We don't have a guess with E in position 3. In ""lives"", we had E in position 4, not 3. In ""bikes"", we had E in position 4 again.

We never tested E in position 3. But we know E is in the word and at position 4. It's possible that there is only one E? Or two? But we don't have evidence of two E's.

However, we can consider that the third letter might be E? But if the third letter were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. But if E were also at position 3, then in ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct) and the E at position 3 in the secret word would not be represented in ""crane"" because we only had one E? But ""crane"" has one E. So if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as '-' (correct for E being present but not at 5) and there would be no feedback for position 3? Because we didn't guess E at position 3. So we don't know if E is at position 3.

But in ""lives"" and ""bikes"", we didn't have E at position 3. We had E at position 4.

So it's possible that E could be at position 3? But we have no evidence against it.

However, we have to consider that the third letter might be E? But then the word would be _ I E E S? That doesn't make sense because position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 4 must be E, and position 5 must be S. So the word would be _ I E E S.

But is there a word like that? For example, ""DIKES"" has E at position 3 and 4? But we have E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3, then we have two E's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

In the feedback for ""lives"", we had E at position 4 marked '✓', and we didn't have any other E in the guess. Similarly, in ""bikes"", we only had one E.

But if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E only at position 5, the feedback for E would be '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. It doesn't tell us about position 3.

In ""lives"", we guessed V at position 3, which was absent, so if the secret word had E at position 3, then we would have no E at position 3 in the guess, so we don't know.

But we can try to test for E at position 3.

However, we are constrained by the pattern: the word must be _ I _ E S.

If we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? But that would be two E's? And position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 3 is E and position 4 is E? That would be two E's.

But is there a word like ""IIES""? No.

The pattern is fixed: position 4 is E, position 5 is S. So if we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? That doesn't form a word. Because position 4 would be E, and position 5 S, so position 3 must be E? Then the word would be _ I E E S. But is there any English word that ends with ""EES""? Not really. For example, ""TREES"" has R and T absent -> invalid. ""DREAMS"" is 6 letters. 

Actually, there are no common English words ending with ""EES"". So it's impossible for the pattern _ I E E S.

Therefore, the third letter cannot be E. So we can rule out that possibility.

Thus, the third letter must be a letter that is not E and not in the absent list.

So available letters for position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

And for position 1: same, except we must avoid the absent letters and E? But E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if position 1 were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as '-' (present but not at 5). But if E were at position 1, then in ""crane"", we didn't have E at position 1 (we had C,R,A,N,E so E at 5 only). So it doesn't conflict.

But if the secret word had E at position 1, then in ""crane"", we would have E at position 5 and it would be marked as '-' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. But we don't have E at position 1 in ""crane"", so we don't know.

But we know E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? Actually, it could be. But if position 1 were E, then the word would be E I _ E S. Then the third letter must be a letter that is not absent and not E? But E is at position 1, so the third letter would be something else.

But we have to consider the possibility.

However, we can try to test for E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it would be a duplicate? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get clear feedback.

So we focus on words without E in position 1 or 3? Position 1: we are considering E? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can try a word that has E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, then we have two E's? And we don't know.

To avoid confusion, we should not put E at position 1 because we know E is at position 4.

So we should avoid using E in position 1 or 3.

Therefore, for position 1, we use a letter that is not E and not absent. Similarly for position 3.

So available letters for position 1: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

For position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we cannot use E because E is at position 4).

Now, we need to form a word: [1] I [3] E S

We can try:

- ""D I _ E S""

What letters can we put in position 3? We have the available letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""D I M E S"" -> ""DIMES"": but M is available, but ""DIMES"" is D-I-M-E-S -> so position 3 is M.

But we haven't tested M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" -> ""DIPES"": not a common word? ""DIPES"" is not standard. 
""DIVES"": D I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.
""DIKES"": D I K E S -> K is absent (from guess 4) -> invalid.
""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.

We must have I at position 2.

So ""DIMES"": D I M E S -> valid word? Yes, meaning coins or dimples? It's accepted in word games sometimes.

But let's see if it fits: 
- Position 1: D, 2: I, 3: M, 4: E, 5: S.

This tests D and M.

Similarly, ""D I P E S"" is not a word.

""J I _ E S"": 
- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""JIMES"": J I M E S -> tests J and M. ""JIMES"" is not common? ""Jimes"" is not a standard word. 
""JUMPS"": doesn't end with ES.

""QUIET"": Q U I E T -> but T is absent -> invalid.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F ILES"": F I L E S -> L absent -> invalid.
- ""F IES"" is 4 letters.
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": not common? ""Fides"" is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? That would be ""FIDES"", which is a valid word (plural of fides? not common). 
But let's check: ""FIDES"" is accepted in Wordle? I think it is.

But we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available? Yes, D is not absent.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""M I _ E S"": 
- ""M ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""M I D E S"" -> ""MIDES"": valid word (plural of mide? not common, but accepted in Wordle). 
- ""M I P E S"" -> ""MIPES"": not a word.
- ""M I Z E S"" -> ""MIZES"": not common.

""O I _ E S"":
- ""O ILES"": L absent -> invalid.
- ""O I D E S"" -> ""OIDES"": not common.
- ""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.
- ""O I Z E S"" -> ""OIZES"": not common.

""W I _ E S"":
- ""W I P E S"" -> ""WIPES"": valid word.
- ""W I D E S"" -> ""WIDES"": not common.
- ""W I K E S"" -> K absent -> invalid (from guess 4).

""PI I _ E S"": 
- ""PI I E S"" -> ""PIES"": 4 letters.
- ""PI I D E S"" -> ""PIDES"": not common.
- ""PI I M E S"" -> ""PIMES"": not a word.
- ""PI I Z E S"" -> ""PIZES"": not common.

""J I _ E S"":
- ""J I V E S"" -> V absent -> invalid.
- ""J I M E S"" -> ""JIMES"": not common.

""F I _ E S"":
- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": valid? F-I-D-E-S? That's 5 letters? Actually, ""FIDES"" is 5 letters: F-I-D-E-S? No, F-I-D-E-S is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? Actually, it's F-I-D-E-S? That's 5: F, I, D, E, S. But ""FIDES"" is usually spelled F-I-D-E-S? I think it's accepted.

But let's check the dictionary: ""Fides"" is not common, but ""FIDES"" might be accepted as a variant of ""fides"" (plural of fidel). But we can use ""FIDES"".

However, we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available.

But we have to see.

Similarly, ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> valid? Yes, meaning sidewalks or city blocks? It's accepted.

But we have to choose.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S -> tests D and M.

Or ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> tests M and D.

We can also try ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.

How about ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.

Or ""BIKES"": but B and K are absent -> invalid.

So we have a few candidates: ""DIMES"", ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", etc.

But we have to pick one.

We can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I and E, so it might be a consonant.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.

But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""D I E E S"" -> but that would be ""DIES"" with an extra E? Not a word.

So I think we should try ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S.

But ""DIMES"" is less common.

""WIPES"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""MIDES"" is common.

But let me check: we have not used P, W, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.

If we guess ""WIPES"", we test W at position 1 and P at position 3.

If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"", we test D and M.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider that the secret word might be ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

But we have to test.

Since we have only two possibilities? Actually, many.

But we can list:

Possible words: 
- ""WIPES"": W I P E S
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S
- ""FIDES"": F I D E S (if accepted)
- ""DIMES"": D I M E S
- ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.
- ""BIKES"": B and K absent -> invalid.
- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, Z is less common.

But ""SIZES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""S I Z E S"" is a word.

But we have to consider that.

We can also try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the frequency.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is more common.

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But we have to pick one.

Since we have multiple options, we can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""WIPES"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use a letter that is not absent.

But we don't have many choices.

Another word: ""O I _ E S""? ""O ILES"" has L -> invalid.

""Q I _ E S"": ""Q I P E S"" -> ""QUIPS"" -> not ending with ES? ""QUIPS"" ends with PS.

We need to end with ES.

""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.

So I think the main candidates are ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""DIMES"", ""SIZES"", etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But let me see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""WIPES"":
- If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.
- If not, then we get feedback on W and P.

Similarly for others.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have such a word.

We can try ""WIPES"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

But I think ""WIPES"" is a good choice because W and P are common.

But let me check: we have not used W, P, D, M, etc.

We can try ""WIPES"".

If we guess ""WIPES"" and it's not the word, then we know:
- If W is absent, then the word must be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If P is absent, then it could be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".
- If both W and P are absent, then we have ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

Similarly, if we guess ""DIMES"" and it's not, then we know D and M are absent? Or at least, if D and M are absent, then it must be ""WIPES"" or ""SIZES"".

But if D and M are absent, then ""WIPES"" is a candidate.

So let's choose ""WIPES"".

But we have to make sure that we are not missing ""DIMES"" or ""MIDES"".

We can also try ""MIDES"".

But I think ""WIPES"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""WIPES"".

But let me see: we have to write it.

So <guess>wipes</guess>

But wait, we have to consider: the secret word might be ""SIZES"", but then we would have S at position 1. But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

In ""SIZES"", we have S at position 1 and 5. So if we guess ""SIZES"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓, else if S is only at position 5, we get - (if S is in the word but not at 1), but we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1 and the secret word has only one S, then we would get x for position 1, and then we know S is at position 5.

But we are trying to find the word.

We can try ""SIZES"".

But it has Z, which is rare.

We can avoid and try ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".

I think ""WIPES"" is better.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is _ I _ E S (position 2: I, position 4: E, position 5: S).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K (all marked ""x"" at some point).
- **E constraints**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"", ""eight"", and ""lives"" feedback). Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 4 is now confirmed as E, so E must be in position 3. But position 3 cannot be E because:
  - If E were in position 3, the word would be _ I E E S. However, no common English word ends with ""EES"" (e.g., ""TREES"" has absent letters).
  - Moreover, in ""lives"" (Guess 3), we had E in position 4 (correct) and no E in position 3, so we never tested position 3 directly.

- **Third position constraints**: Must be a letter not in {C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, E} (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- **First position constraints**: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not E (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the pattern _ I _ E S, the most common valid words are:
- **WIPES** (W I P E S): Tests W and P.
- **MIDES** (M I D E S): Tests M and D.
- **DIMES** (D I M E S): Tests D and M.
- **SIZES** (S I Z E S): Tests S and Z (but S is already known to be in position 5, so if S is in position 1, it would be a duplicate; Z is uncommon).

**Strategy**: Prioritize **""WIPES""** because:
- It tests two new common letters: **W** (position 1) and **P** (position 3).
- It avoids rare letters (Z in ""SIZES"").
- If correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on W and P will confirm if they are present or absent, narrowing options to ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" for the next guess.

Choose a word that includes E (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.\n 2. Avoid using C, R, A, N.\n 3. Use other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated C, R, A, N. So we can use other consonants and vowels.\n\n Vowels: We have E (which we know is in) and we have other vowels: I, O, U (since A is out). But note: the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but words usually do.\n\n Consonants: We have many left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is E.\n\n We can try a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.\n\n Some common letters to try: S, T, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that:\n - Has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5, because that was the position in ""crane"" and it was wrong).\n - Does not contain C, R, A, N.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""SPITE"": but note that we have E at the end again? We want to avoid the end for E? Actually, we don\'t know if E can be at the end again? But the feedback only said that E is in the word but not at the end. So it could be at the end again? Actually, no: the feedback for the fifth letter was E and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put E again at the end, it would be the same position and we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, we should try E in a different position.\n\n Let\'s try to put E in the first position? Example: ""EIGHT"" -> but note that we have G and H which are less common? Also, we have I (a vowel) and T.\n\n But we can also consider other words.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T, I, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? Actually: \n      T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5)\n\n But note: we have E in the 4th position. Also, we avoid the end for E? Actually, we are putting E in the 4th and S at the end. This is acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if ""TIMES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\n But let\'s think of other options.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word, we can try to use it and also other common letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has E and also S, T, L, which are very common.\n\n Example: ""STOLE"" -> \n   S, T, O, L, E -> E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try E at the end again? But the feedback said E is not at the end, so if we put E at the end again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again. But that doesn\'t give us new information about the position of E. So it\'s better to try E in a different position.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" has E at the end? So we avoid that.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? \n   S, E, T, U, P -> E is in the second position? \n   But note: we have U (a vowel) and P.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E is in the 4th position.\n\n But let\'s think of words that have E in the first position: \n   ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: ""ELBOW"", ""EIGHT"", ""EJECT"" (but J is rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (too long? no, 5 letters: ""EMPLOY"" is 6? Actually, ""EMPLOY"" is 6 letters. So we need 5 letters).\n\n Actually, ""ELBOW"" is 5 letters: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has B, O, W, L.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> but E is at the end again? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we can try to avoid the end to get more information about the position of E.\n\n How about ""HOMES""? \n   H, O, M, E, S -> E is in the 4th position? \n   But we have E in the 4th and S at the end. Also, we have O and M.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LOUSE"": \n   L, O, U, S, E -> E at the end again? Same problem.\n\n We need a word that has E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 and avoids the end? Actually, we can try any position except 5? But note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one E? The feedback only told us that there is at least one E.\n\n Since the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the 5th position, we can try to put E in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5:\n\n - Position 1: ""E"", then what? e.g., ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""EJECT"" (rare), ""ELUDE"", ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""ENVOY"" (5 letters: E, N, V, O, Y -> but N is out! We cannot use N because we know N is not in the word. So ""ENVOY"" is invalid because of N).\n\n So we must avoid N.\n\n How about ""E"" followed by other letters? \n\n - ""E"" in position 1: ""E"" _ _ _ _ \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + 4 other letters (without C, R, A, N) and without repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n We can try ""E"" in position 2: _ E _ _ _\n   Examples: ""BELIE"" (but that\'s 6 letters) -> no, 5 letters: ""BELIE"" is 6. \n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if B, L, O, W are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""TEETH"": T, E, E, T, H -> but has two E\'s and two T\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have duplicate letters.\n\n However, we are trying to get maximum information. So using duplicate letters might not be ideal.\n\n How about ""PESTO"": P, E, S, T, O -> E in position 2? \n   But we don\'t know if P, S, T, O are in the word.\n\n Another: ""DEBIT"": D, E, B, I, T -> E in position 2.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the middle and also includes other common letters.\n\n We can try to use the letter S because it is very common.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (position 1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n But we have L at the end. And we know E is in the word but not at the end? Actually, we know E is not at position 5, but it could be at position 4? We don\'t know. So we can try.\n\n However, we have to consider that the feedback for E in the first guess was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 4, that might be a good test.\n\n But note: if the secret word has E at position 4, then we would get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' again and we know E is not at 4 either.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the first position? \n\n Let me try to find a word that has E in the first position and without the forbidden letters:\n\n - ""E"" at position 1: \n   Examples: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n   Words: ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""ENVOY"" (has N -> invalid), ""EJECT"" (has C -> invalid), ""EMPLOY"" (6 letters), ""EERIE"" (has R -> invalid) -> so ""EIGHT"", ""ELBOW"", ""ELUDE"", ""E"" + 4 new letters.\n\n But we also want to cover more common letters.\n\n Let me consider ""EIGHT"": \n   E, I, G, H, T -> all new letters.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N. So ""EIGHT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we have E in the first position. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWER"": but T, O, W, E, R -> but R is out! We know R is not in the word. So we cannot use R.\n\n So we must avoid R.\n\n Another word: ""STOLE"" has E at the end -> avoid.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E in the 4th position? \n   This word: \n      S (1), P (2), I (3), E (4), L (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 4. Also, we are testing S, P, I, L.\n\n But note: we have L at the end. We don\'t know about L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TIMES"": \n   T (1), I (2), M (3), E (4), S (5) -> but E is at the 4th and S at the end. We are testing E at 4 and S at 5.\n\n But we know that E is not at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 4. So it\'s okay.\n\n However, we have two common letters: S and T. \n\n Another idea: we can try ""LOUIE"" (a name?) or ""DOZEN"" (has N -> invalid). \n\n Let me think of a word that has E in the first position and uses common letters:\n\n ""E"" at 1: ""E"", then 4 other letters without C, R, A, N. \n Possible: \n   ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> common letters.\n   ""ELBOW"" (E, L, B, O, W) -> also common.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""EIGHT"" uses E, I, G, H, T. \n ""ELBOW"" uses E, L, B, O, W.\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We know that the secret word has E, so we are going to get at least one \'-\' (for E) and then four new letters to test.\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The letters in ""EIGHT"": I, G, H, T are common. \n The letters in ""ELBOW"": L, B, O, W are also common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated 4 letters (C, R, A, N) and we know E is in. So we have 21 letters left.\n\n We can also consider ""HOUSE"" but E is at the end -> avoid.\n\n Another word: ""STEEL"" -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating E? We know E is in, but we don\'t know if there are two. However, we are trying to get information about other letters.\n\n But note: if we use a word with two E\'s, then we might get feedback for the second E? But we don\'t know if there is a second E. It\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\n So ""EIGHT"" has distinct letters: E, I, G, H, T.\n\n Similarly, ""ELBOW"" has distinct: E, L, B, O, W.\n\n How about ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E in position 2? \n   This word: \n      T (1), E (2), P (3), I (4), D (5)\n\n We are testing E at position 2 and also T, P, I, D.\n\n But note: we have D at the end. \n\n We can also consider ""SPIED"": S, P, I, E, D -> E in the 4th position? \n\n After considering, I think ""EIGHT"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and places E at the beginning.\n\n But wait: we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at the beginning? We haven\'t tested the beginning.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in the middle? \n\n However, we have no information about the middle. So either position 1, 2, 3, or 4 are possible.\n\n I think ""EIGHT"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has I, G, H, T. But that\'s the point: we are testing them.\n\n So let\'s go with ""EIGHT"".\n\n However, we must ensure that ""EIGHT"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, our next guess: ""EIGHT""\n\n We are hoping to get feedback on E (which we know will be either \'-\' or if we are lucky, \'✓\') and also on I, G, H, T.\n\n But note: we are putting E in the first position. If the secret word has E in the first, then we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E is in the word but not at the beginning and not at the end (from the first guess). So then E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n So let\'s choose ""EIGHT"".\n\n<guess>eight</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is in the word but **not in the 5th position** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 5**.\n- Exclude **C, R, A, N**.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""EIGHT""** fits well:\n- **E** is placed in **position 1** (testing a new position for E).\n- Uses new common letters: **I, G, H, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N) and repeats.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of E and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>eight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- E is in the word but not in the 1st position (since we got \'-\' for E at position 1).\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, because in ""eight"", I is the second letter).\n- G, H, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T\nPresent letters: E (but not in position 1 or 5) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe also know that the secret word has the letter I in the second position and the letter E is somewhere else, but not in position 1 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the form: _ I _ _ _\n\nAnd E is in one of the positions: 3, 4, or possibly 2? But position 2 is I, so E cannot be in position 2. So E must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, we know E is not in position 5 from the first guess? Actually, the first guess had E in position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: in the second guess, we put E in position 1 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is not in position 1. So E is not in position 1. We already knew it\'s not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have the following letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nSo the available letters are: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, but we know it\'s present) and I (which is fixed at position 2).\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has I in the second position.\n- Has E in either position 3 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 1,2,5).\n- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T.\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s consider the positions:\n\nPosition 1: must be one of the available letters (not C,R,A,N,G,H,T) and not E (because E is not in position 1). So we can use: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\nPosition 2: must be I (fixed).\nPosition 3: could be E or another letter? But we know E must be in 3 or 4, so if we put E in position 3, then position 4 must be another letter. If we put E in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.\nPosition 4: same as above.\nPosition 5: must be one of the available letters (and not E, because E is not in position 5).\n\nWe can try to form words with E in position 3 or 4.\n\nFirst, let\'s try E in position 3: then the word is _ I E _ _\nWe need to fill position 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the available set and without the absent ones.\n\nAvailable for position 1: B, D, F, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nAvailable for position 4: same, but note we are using one letter for position 1, then position 4, and position 5 must be one of the remaining.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might be able to test multiple letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: then the word is _ I _ E _\n\nWe need to choose a word that uses common letters and tests as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nOption 1: E in position 3: _ I E _ _\nPossible words:\n- ""LIE"" + two letters? But we need 5 letters. So: \n  - ""LIE"" is 4, so we need 5: e.g., ""LIVES"" -> but S is at the end? But we have to avoid T? T is absent, but S is still available. However, ""LIVES"" has V and S. But note: we have to check if the word is valid.\n\nBut wait, we must avoid T? Yes, T is absent.\n\nAnother: ""DICES"" -> but C is absent. Invalid.\n""PIECE"" -> has E again? And C is absent -> invalid.\n""FIESTA"" -> 6 letters? No, 5? ""FIESTA"" is 6. \n""BIELD"" -> not a common word? And D is available, but let\'s see.\n\nActually, ""BIELD"" is not standard. We need valid words.\n\nHow about ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are using E in position 3 and 5? But we know E is not in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, it would be wrong? But the word has two E\'s? The feedback might be tricky.\n\nBut note: we know E is not in position 5 (from first guess). So if we put E in position 5, it would be incorrect and we know that? But we are trying to test other positions.\n\nHowever, ""SIEVE"" has E in position 3 and 5. But we know position 5 is not E, so the E in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or if the word has two E\'s? The rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get \'-\'. If the letter is not in the word, we get \'x\'. But if the word has two E\'s, then if we put an E in a position where there is only one, it might be marked as \'-\' or \'x\'? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has one E and we put two E\'s, then one of them might be \'-\' or \'x\' and the other might be \'x\' if the secret word has only one.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the secret word has one or two E\'s. So it might be risky.\n\nWe can avoid duplicates for now to get clearer feedback.\n\nSo let\'s try to find a word with E in position 3 and without E in other positions? But we are forced to put E in position 3 or 4? Actually, we can put E in position 4 as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can try E in position 4: _ I _ E _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DICES"" -> C absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> E in position 4? \n  - Position 1: L, 2: I (fixed), 3: V, 4: E, 5: S.\n  - This uses L, V, S which are new.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes, T is absent. So ""LIVES"" is acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> has E at position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? But we are putting E in position 3 as well. This might be confusing.\n\nBut we can try ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""PIECE"" -> has C and two E\'s -> invalid because of C.\n\n""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: B, 2: I, 3: K, 4: E, 5: S.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it uses B, K, S.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""DIKES"" -> D, I, K, E, S -> same as above but with D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is in the word.\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4: \n- ""LIVES"" has E in position 4? Actually, in ""LIVES"": \n  Position 1: L, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: S -> so E is in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has S, L, V, B, D, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try E in position 3: \n- ""SIEVE"": S, I, E, V, E -> but E in position 3 and 5. We know position 5 is not E, so the E at position 5 will be marked as absent? And the E in position 3 might be marked as present or absent? \n  - If the secret word has only one E, then the E in position 3 might be marked as \'-\' (if E is in the word but not at 3) and the E at 5 would be \'x\'. \n  - But if the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two marks.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it might be messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without duplicate letters and without E in position 5.\n\nSo ""LIVES"" is a candidate: L, I, V, E, S -> all distinct and E in position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut ""BIKES"" has K and S. \n\nWe can also consider ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> E in position 4.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe also have the option to put E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good candidate without duplicates.\n\nWhat about ""SIEVE""? It has duplicate E\'s. Let\'s avoid.\n\nAnother word with E in position 3: ""MIDST"" -> but T is absent? T is out, so no.\n\n""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: J, 2: I, 3: V, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests J, V, D.\n\nBut J is less common. We might want to test more common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DINED"": D, I, N, E, D -> but N is absent! We cannot use N.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""FIRED"": F, I, R, E, D -> R is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"".\n\nWe can also consider E in position 4 and use a word like ""LIVES"" or ""BIKES"". \n\nBut note: we have not used S, L, V, B, K, etc.\n\nWe can also try to cover more vowels? We have I (already fixed) and E (present). The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but common words usually have vowels.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, I, etc. We have E and I confirmed.\n\nThe absent vowels: A is absent. So the remaining vowels are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo we might want to test O or U.\n\nBut in ""LIVES"", we have V and S (S is a consonant). \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> but E is in position 4? \n- Position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D.\n\nThis is a valid word. And it tests O, L, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\nAnother: ""OILES"": O, I, L, E, S -> E in position 4? \n\nBut we have to avoid T? Yes.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure we don\'t use absent letters.\n\nSo ""OILED"" is acceptable? Let\'s check: O, I, L, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,A,N,G,H,T). So yes.\n\nBut we have to consider that we are testing O, L, D.\n\nSimilarly, ""OILES"" is a valid word: O, I, L, E, S.\n\nBut we have S at the end.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"": S, O, W, E, D -> E in position 4? \n- Position 1: S, 2: O? But we need position 2 to be I! So we cannot change position 2. We must have I in position 2.\n\nSo the word must have I in the second position.\n\nTherefore, we are limited to words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith E in position 3 or 4.\n\nAnd without C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- With E in position 3: \n  - ""DIKES"": D, I, K, E, S -> but G and H are absent? We have K and S. But ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, but note: we have E in position 4? Wait, ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> so E is in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.\n\nSo for E in position 3: we need a word where the third letter is E? But we don\'t have many words with E in the middle? \n\nActually, it\'s hard to have E in position 3 because many words with E in the middle have vowels or other letters.\n\nFor example: ""BIKES"" has E in position 4? \n\nLet me clarify: \n- Position 3: the third letter.\n\nSo for E in position 3: the third letter is E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""DIETS"" -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n- ""LIENS"" -> N absent -> invalid.\n- ""MIELS"" -> not common? \n- ""PIECE"" -> has C and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it seems difficult to find a word with E in position 3 without using absent letters.\n\nTherefore, E is likely in position 4.\n\nSo we can assume E is in position 4? But we haven\'t tested position 3? Actually, we don\'t know. We are considering E in position 4. But we must test it.\n\nWe can try a word that has E in position 4 and tests common letters.\n\nBut we also need to test position 1 and 5.\n\nWe have to choose a word that uses available letters.\n\nLet me list words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E [letter5]\n\nWithout C,R,A,N,G,H,T.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""LIVES"": L, I, V, E, S -> tests L, V, S (and E in position 4, and I in position 2 fixed).\n- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B, K, S.\n- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W, P, S.\n- ""DICES"": invalid (C)\n- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.\n- ""FIVES"": F, I, V, E, S -> tests F, V, S.\n- ""JIVES"": J, I, V, E, S -> tests J, V, S.\n- ""LIVES"" and ""BIKES"" are good.\n\nWe can also consider ""SOWED"" but position 2 must be I, so not.\n\nAnother: ""QUIET"" -> Q, U, I, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\n""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E -> but E in position 1? We know position 1 is not E. Also, we have two E\'s? And T is absent? Actually, no T, but E in position 1 is not allowed.\n\nWe cannot use E in position 1.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""LIVES"", ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""FIVES"", etc.\n\nWe want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: S, L, D, O, U, B, P, etc.\n\n""LIVES"" uses L, V, S.\n""BIKES"" uses B, K, S.\n""WIPES"" uses W, P, S.\n""FIVES"" uses F, V, S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so it\'s good to test S.\n\nAlso, L and D are common.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have S, L, etc.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests L, V, S.\n\nBut let me check if ""LIVES"" is valid: yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SIEVE"" but it has duplicate E -> avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""PIECE"" -> invalid because of C.\n\nHow about ""OWIES"": O, W, I, E, S -> but position 2 is W? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nSo I think ""LIVES"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that E might be in position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3. But we are assuming E is in position 4 because it\'s more common? Or we can test both?\n\nWe can test a word that has E in position 3? But we don\'t have a good word without absent letters.\n\nFor example, ""MIKES"": M, I, K, E, S -> E in position 4? Actually, position 3 is K, position 4 is E -> so E in position 4? Same as ""BIKES"".\n\nIf we want E in position 3, we have to use a word like ""DEICE"" -> but D, E, I, C, E -> C is absent and duplicate E -> invalid.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""BIDET"" -> B, I, D, E, T -> but T is absent -> invalid.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with E in position 3: \n- ""DIETC"" -> invalid.\n- ""LIKEN"" -> N absent.\n- ""VIENS"" -> not common.\n\nSo probably E is in position 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> tests O, L, D. And E in position 4.\n\nBut ""OILED"" has E in position 4 and D at the end.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIPED"": W, I, P, E, D -> tests W, P, D.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""LIVES"" is a good choice because it tests S at the end, which is common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LIVES"".\n\nBut note: we are putting E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a checkmark. If not, then we get a \'-\' and we know E must be in position 3 (since it can\'t be 1,2,5 and we are testing 4).\n\nAlso, we test L, V, S.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""LIVES"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""LIVES"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: ""LIVES""\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-) -> so E is in the word but not at 5.\nSecond guess: eight -> E(-) meaning E is in the word but not at 1, and I(✓) meaning I is at position 2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo <guess>lives</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T (marked ""x"").\n- **Present letters**: \n  - **E** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).\n  - **I** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2** (from ""eight"" feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **I in position 2**.\n- Contain **E** in position 3 or 4 (since positions 1, 2, and 5 are invalid for E).\n- Exclude all absent letters.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Prioritize testing **E in position 4** (as position 3 is less common for E in this pattern).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, D, O**) to maximize information.\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\n**""LIVES""** fits perfectly:\n- **L** (position 1), **I** (position 2, fixed), **V** (position 3), **E** (position 4), **S** (position 5).\n- Tests E in position 4 and new letters L, V, S.\n- Uses distinct letters to avoid ambiguity.\n\nThis guess will help confirm the position of E and test three additional letters.\n\n<guess>lives</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\n  - I is in position 2 (correct).\n  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got \'-\' for E at position 1).\n  - G, H, T are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)\n  - I is still in position 2 (correct, as we knew).\n  - E is now in position 4 and correct (so the secret word has E in position 4).\n  - S is in position 5 and correct.\n  - L and V are not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has: \n  - Position 2: I\n  - Position 4: E\n  - Position 5: S\n- Therefore, the word is: _ I _ E S\n\nWe also know that the first letter is unknown, and the third letter is unknown.\n\nBut we know the following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nAnd we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nNow, what about the first and third letters? We need to find 5-letter words of the form _ I _ E S.\n\nWe also know from previous feedback that:\n- E is not in position 1 or 5 (from guess 1 and 2) and now we know it\'s in position 4, which matches.\n- The third letter is not E (because if it were, it would have been marked as \'-\' or \'x\' in previous guesses? Actually, in ""crane"", E was in position 5 and marked \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 5. In ""eight"", E was at position 1 and marked \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not at 1. Now in ""lives"", E is at position 4 and marked \'✓\', so it\'s correct. So the third letter is not E because if it were, then in ""lives"" we would have had a \'-\' for the third letter? But the third letter in ""lives"" is V and it was marked \'x\', so V is absent. And the first letter was L and marked \'x\', so L is absent.\n\nBut what about the third letter? We haven\'t tested it directly. However, we know that the secret word has E in position 4 and S in position 5. The third letter must be a letter that is not E (because E is at 4) and not any of the absent letters.\n\nWe also know that the first letter is not any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nTherefore, the first letter can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe third letter can be: any letter except the absent ones and except E (because E is at 4). But note: the third letter could be E? But we know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in ""lives"" we would have had a \'-\' for the third letter? But the third letter was V and marked \'x\', so V is absent, not E. So the third letter is not E and not any of the absent letters.\n\nNow, we need to find words of the form: [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nWe can list possible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": but we know G is absent? G is absent from guess 2. So ""BIKES"" has K and S? But we have S at the end. However, ""BIKES"" is B-I-K-E-S. But we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. So if we write the word as _ I _ E S, then ""BIKES"" would be B I K E S -> so letter1 = B, letter3 = K.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested B and K. Also, note that in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent, so if the word were ""BIKES"", then K would be at position 3.\n\nBut we must check if K is allowed? Yes, because it\'s not in the absent list.\n\nSimilarly, we can think of other words.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""DICES"": but C is absent -> invalid.\n- ""DINES"": N absent -> invalid.\n- ""FIVES"": F I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.\n- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> P and W are not absent? We haven\'t tested P and W. So ""WIPES"" is a candidate? But wait, we have E in position 4 and S in position 5. ""WIPES"" is W-I-P-E-S.\n\nBut we must check: in ""lives"", we had V at position 3 and it was absent. So if the word is ""WIPES"", then position 3 is P. And we haven\'t tested P.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the third letter might be something else.\n\nAnother word: ""BIKES"" is not possible because of K? We haven\'t tested K. But ""BIKES"" is a valid word.\n\nBut let\'s list all possible words of the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nWithout using absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V.\n\nSo letter1 can be: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLetter3 can be: any from the above except the absent letters and except E (because E is at 4) and except the letters we know are absent.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> tests B and K.\n- ""DICES"": invalid (C)\n- ""FIVES"": invalid (V absent)\n- ""JIVES"": invalid (V absent)\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S -> tests W and P.\n- ""MICES"": M I C E S -> C absent -> invalid.\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D.\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S -> tests P and K.\n- ""SIECES"": too long? 6 letters.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1 and 5? We know S is at position 5, but if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s? The feedback for ""lives"" had S at position 5 marked \'✓\', but that doesn\'t say anything about another S. However, we haven\'t tested S in other positions.\n\nBut note: in ""lives"", we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had two S\'s, then we might have more information? But we don\'t have any other S in the guess.\n\nSo ""SIZES"" is a word? Yes, but it has Z. And we haven\'t tested Z.\n\nBut let\'s see: the word would be S I Z E S. \n- Position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S.\n- But we know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to guess the word. We can consider ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is less common.\n\nWe can also consider ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", etc.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I as the second vowel? The word has I and E, and possibly others.\n\nWe have to test the possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? Actually, we have used 3 guesses and we have 6 total, so we have 3 more.\n\nWe can try to guess the word directly.\n\nBut we don\'t have enough information about the first and third letters.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we can also try a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but also tests other common letters that we haven\'t used.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe haven\'t used: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and tests two new common letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nFor example, ""BIKES"" tests B and K.\n\nBut we can also try ""MIDES"": M and D.\n\nOr ""PIKES"": P and K.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has O or U? Because vowels are important.\n\nThe word has I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But not necessarily.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""IDES"": but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5. ""IDES"" is 4, so not.\n- ""SIECES"": not 5.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S at position 1 and 5? We know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try ""SIZES"", but it has Z which is rare.\n\nWe can also try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""FIVES"" is invalid because of V.\n\n""JIVES"" invalid.\n\n""QUIET"" has T and is invalid.\n\n""EXILES"": E X I L E -> but E is at position 1? We know position 1 is not E (from guess 2). Also, L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""OXIDES"": O X I D E S -> but that\'s 6 letters? O-X-I-D-E-S? 6 letters. \n\n""OXIDE"" is 5: O-X-I-D-E -> but then we need S at the end? No, it ends with E. We need E in position 4 and S in position 5. So ""OXIDES"" is 6 letters.\n\n""OILED"": O I L E D -> but L is absent and D is at the end? But we need S at the end. So no.\n\nWe must have E in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nSo the word must end with ""ES"", and the second letter is I.\n\nSo the pattern is: ? I ? E S\n\nNow, what words fit this pattern?\n\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""IDES"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n- ""SIEVES"": S I E V E S -> but V is absent and also E in position 3? But we have E in position 4, so if we put E in position 3, it would be a duplicate? And V is absent. So invalid.\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> this is S-I-Z-E-S, so position 1: S, 2: I, 3: Z, 4: E, 5: S. This is a valid word (meaning to size with seams). And it tests S at position 1 and Z at position 3.\n\nBut we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nBut we have limited options.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit the pattern and don\'t use absent letters.\n\n- ""BIKES"": B, I, K, E, S -> tests B and K.\n- ""WIPES"": W, I, P, E, S -> tests W and P.\n- ""PIKES"": P, I, K, E, S -> tests P and K.\n- ""MIDES"": M, I, D, E, S -> tests M and D.\n- ""SIZES"": S, I, Z, E, S -> tests S and Z (and duplicate S? but we don\'t know if S is duplicated).\n\nBut note: we know S is in the word (from the fact that it was marked \'✓\' in position 5, but that was for the fifth position only). We don\'t know if S appears elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, we know E is in position 4 and S in position 5.\n\nNow, we can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we have to consider that the third letter might be a letter that we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a vowel in the third position? The third position is often a consonant, but vowels can be there too? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word.\n\nActually, the third letter can be a vowel? For example, ""QUITES"" is 6 letters.\n\nWhat about ""IMAGES""? But G is absent and position 2 is I, but position 3 is A? And A is absent. Also, it ends with S? No.\n\nWe need the word to end with ""ES"", so the last two letters are fixed as E and S.\n\nSo the third letter is the one before S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S\n\nAlso, ""TOWES"" -> T is absent -> invalid.\n""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> but position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nWe must have I at position 2.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter1] I [letter3] E S\n\nSo letter1 and letter3 are unknown.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has more common letters.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that the secret word might be ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", etc.\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nSince we have three positions to guess and we know three letters, we can try to guess.\n\nBut we have 3 more guesses, so we can afford to test.\n\nHowever, we can try a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" to test B and K.\n\nBut if we guess ""BIKES"" and it\'s not the word, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nLet me see which letters are more common.\n\nCommon consonants: B, D, M, P, W, etc.\n\nVowels: we have I and E, so the third letter might be a vowel? But in the third position? For example, ""IXES"" is not a word. ""AICES"" has A -> invalid.\n\nWhat about ""OILES""? O I L E S -> but L is absent -> invalid.\n\n""UILES"" -> not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with a vowel in the third position.\n\nTherefore, the third letter is likely a consonant: B, D, K, P, W, etc.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"" or ""WIPES"".\n\nBut we have to avoid using too many rare letters.\n\nWe can also try ""PIKES"": P I K E S.\n\nBut let me check: we have not used P, K, B, W, M, D, etc.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the first letter might be one of these.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4 and S in position 5, but with different letters to test more.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has the form [letter1] I [letter3] E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that B and K are not absent? We haven\'t tested them, so they are possible.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: if the word is ""BIKES"", then we get it right. If not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.\n\nBut let me see the frequency.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has O or U? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" is invalid.\n\n""FIKES"": F I K E S -> F is not absent? We haven\'t tested F. So ""FIKES"" is a word? Yes, meaning to fix or make fast. But it\'s rare? Or is it? I think it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we can use ""BIKES"" which is more common.\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: ""BIKES"" is common.\n\nSimilarly, ""WIPES"" is common.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we are putting B at position 1 and K at position 3.\n\nIf the word is ""WIPES"", then we would get B as absent and K as absent? Then we know to try ""WIPES"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if we get B correct and K absent, then we know B is in the word but not at position 1? But we are putting B at position 1, so if it\'s correct, we get a check. If it\'s present but wrong position, we get \'-\'. If absent, we get \'x\'.\n\nBut we are testing B and K.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing something.\n\nWe know the word has E in position 4 and S in position 5, and I in position 2.\n\nSo the word is: [1] I [3] E S\n\nWe have to fill 1 and 3 with letters not in {C,R,A,N,G,H,T,L,V} and not E (for position 3, because position 4 is E).\n\nSo for position 1: possible letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor position 3: same, but note that it must form a word.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""BIKES"": B I K E S\n- ""WIPES"": W I P E S\n- ""PIKES"": P I K E S\n- ""MIDES"": M I D E S\n- ""SIZES"": S I Z E S (but S is at position 1 and 5, so if S is at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s)\n\nBut we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be marked as present or absent.\n\nBut we are trying to find the word.\n\nWe can also consider ""DICES"" is invalid.\n\n""FIKES"": F I K E S -> valid, but less common.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let me see: we have not used B, K, W, P, M, D, F, etc.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have much to go on.\n\nWe can try ""BIKES"".\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback and then we can narrow down.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not missing the possibility that the third letter is a vowel? But it\'s unlikely.\n\nFor example, ""IXES"" is not a word.\n\n""OILES"" has L -> invalid.\n\nSo I think ""BIKES"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess: ""BIKES""\n\nBut wait, we have to write it.\n\nSo <guess>bikes</guess>\n\nBut let me double-check the pattern.\n\nThe secret word: _ I _ E S\n\nWe are guessing ""BIKES"": B I K E S -> so position 1: B, 2: I (should be correct), 3: K, 4: E (correct), 5: S (correct).\n\nIf the word is ""BIKES"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nBut if we get B as absent and K as absent, then we know to try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES"" next.\n\nSimilarly, if B is absent and K is present, then we know B is absent and K is present? But then what? We don\'t know the position of K.\n\nBut we can then adjust.\n\nSo it\'s okay.\n\nWe can also try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nBut I think ""BIKES"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V (marked ""x"").\n- **Present letters**:\n  - **I** is confirmed in **position 2** (✓ from ""eight"").\n  - **E** is confirmed in **position 4** (✓ from ""lives"").\n  - **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (✓ from ""lives"").\n- **E cannot be in positions 1 or 5** (from ""crane"" and ""eight"" feedback).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ I _ E S\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters, which must be from the remaining available letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note E and I are already placed).\n\n**Key insights**:\n- The third letter cannot be E (since E is fixed at position 4) or any absent letter.\n- The first letter cannot be any absent letter.\n- Common words fitting the pattern include ""BIKES"", ""WIPES"", ""PIKES"", ""MIDES"", and ""SIZES"".\n\nAfter evaluating, **""BIKES""** is a strong guess because:\n- It tests two new common letters: **B** (position 1) and **K** (position 3).\n- It avoids all absent letters.\n- If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on B and K will quickly narrow down the options (e.g., if B is absent, try ""WIPES"" or ""PIKES""; if K is absent, try ""MIDES"" or ""SIZES"").\n\n<guess>bikes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)\n  - I is in position 2 (correct).\n  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in 5, from guess 1).\n  - G, H, T are absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)\n  - I is still in position 2 (correct).\n  - E is in position 4 (correct).\n  - S is in position 5 (correct).\n  - L and V are absent.\n\nGuess 4: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(x), E(✓), S(✓)\n  - I is still in position 2 (correct).\n  - E is still in position 4 (correct).\n  - S is still in position 5 (correct).\n  - B and K are absent.\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ I _ E S\n- Position 2: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- Position 5: S (fixed)\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K\n- Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we have to avoid the absent letters).\n\nBut we also know that the third letter cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if the third letter were E, then in previous guesses, when we had E in position 3? We don\'t have a guess with E in position 3. In ""lives"", we had E in position 4, not 3. In ""bikes"", we had E in position 4 again.\n\nWe never tested E in position 3. But we know E is in the word and at position 4. It\'s possible that there is only one E? Or two? But we don\'t have evidence of two E\'s.\n\nHowever, we can consider that the third letter might be E? But if the third letter were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E in position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at 5. But if E were also at position 3, then in ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as \'-\' (correct) and the E at position 3 in the secret word would not be represented in ""crane"" because we only had one E? But ""crane"" has one E. So if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", the E at position 5 would be marked as \'-\' (correct for E being present but not at 5) and there would be no feedback for position 3? Because we didn\'t guess E at position 3. So we don\'t know if E is at position 3.\n\nBut in ""lives"" and ""bikes"", we didn\'t have E at position 3. We had E at position 4.\n\nSo it\'s possible that E could be at position 3? But we have no evidence against it.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that the third letter might be E? But then the word would be _ I E E S? That doesn\'t make sense because position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 4 must be E, and position 5 must be S. So the word would be _ I E E S.\n\nBut is there a word like that? For example, ""DIKES"" has E at position 3 and 4? But we have E at position 4, so if we put E at position 3, then we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nIn the feedback for ""lives"", we had E at position 4 marked \'✓\', and we didn\'t have any other E in the guess. Similarly, in ""bikes"", we only had one E.\n\nBut if the secret word had E at position 3, then when we guessed ""crane"", which has E only at position 5, the feedback for E would be \'-\' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. It doesn\'t tell us about position 3.\n\nIn ""lives"", we guessed V at position 3, which was absent, so if the secret word had E at position 3, then we would have no E at position 3 in the guess, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try to test for E at position 3.\n\nHowever, we are constrained by the pattern: the word must be _ I _ E S.\n\nIf we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? But that would be two E\'s? And position 4 is E, so if we put E at position 3, then position 3 is E and position 4 is E? That would be two E\'s.\n\nBut is there a word like ""IIES""? No.\n\nThe pattern is fixed: position 4 is E, position 5 is S. So if we put E at position 3, then the word is _ I E E S? That doesn\'t form a word. Because position 4 would be E, and position 5 S, so position 3 must be E? Then the word would be _ I E E S. But is there any English word that ends with ""EES""? Not really. For example, ""TREES"" has R and T absent -> invalid. ""DREAMS"" is 6 letters. \n\nActually, there are no common English words ending with ""EES"". So it\'s impossible for the pattern _ I E E S.\n\nTherefore, the third letter cannot be E. So we can rule out that possibility.\n\nThus, the third letter must be a letter that is not E and not in the absent list.\n\nSo available letters for position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd for position 1: same, except we must avoid the absent letters and E? But E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? We know E is at position 4, so if position 1 were E, then in the first guess ""crane"", we had E at position 5 and it was marked as \'-\' (present but not at 5). But if E were at position 1, then in ""crane"", we didn\'t have E at position 1 (we had C,R,A,N,E so E at 5 only). So it doesn\'t conflict.\n\nBut if the secret word had E at position 1, then in ""crane"", we would have E at position 5 and it would be marked as \'-\' (correct) because E is present but not at 5. But we don\'t have E at position 1 in ""crane"", so we don\'t know.\n\nBut we know E is at position 4, so position 1 cannot be E? Actually, it could be. But if position 1 were E, then the word would be E I _ E S. Then the third letter must be a letter that is not absent and not E? But E is at position 1, so the third letter would be something else.\n\nBut we have to consider the possibility.\n\nHowever, we can try to test for E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it would be a duplicate? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get clear feedback.\n\nSo we focus on words without E in position 1 or 3? Position 1: we are considering E? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try a word that has E at position 1? But we know E is at position 4, so if we put E at position 1, then we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we should not put E at position 1 because we know E is at position 4.\n\nSo we should avoid using E in position 1 or 3.\n\nTherefore, for position 1, we use a letter that is not E and not absent. Similarly for position 3.\n\nSo available letters for position 1: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor position 3: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and note, we cannot use E because E is at position 4).\n\nNow, we need to form a word: [1] I [3] E S\n\nWe can try:\n\n- ""D I _ E S""\n\nWhat letters can we put in position 3? We have the available letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try ""D I M E S"" -> ""DIMES"": but M is available, but ""DIMES"" is D-I-M-E-S -> so position 3 is M.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested M.\n\nSimilarly, ""D I P E S"" -> ""DIPES"": not a common word? ""DIPES"" is not standard. \n""DIVES"": D I V E S -> but V is absent (from guess 3) -> invalid.\n""DIKES"": D I K E S -> K is absent (from guess 4) -> invalid.\n""DOZES"": D O Z E S -> position 2 is O? We need position 2 to be I. So not.\n\nWe must have I at position 2.\n\nSo ""DIMES"": D I M E S -> valid word? Yes, meaning coins or dimples? It\'s accepted in word games sometimes.\n\nBut let\'s see if it fits: \n- Position 1: D, 2: I, 3: M, 4: E, 5: S.\n\nThis tests D and M.\n\nSimilarly, ""D I P E S"" is not a word.\n\n""J I _ E S"": \n- ""JIVES"": J I V E S -> V absent -> invalid.\n- ""JIMES"": J I M E S -> tests J and M. ""JIMES"" is not common?

I think it is.\n\nBut we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available? Yes, D is not absent.\n\nBut we have to see.\n\nSimilarly, ""M I _ E S"": \n- ""M ILES"": L absent -> invalid.\n- ""M I D E S"" -> ""MIDES"": valid word (plural of mide? not common, but accepted in Wordle). \n- ""M I P E S"" -> ""MIPES"": not a word.\n- ""M I Z E S"" -> ""MIZES"": not common.\n\n""O I _ E S"":\n- ""O ILES"": L absent -> invalid.\n- ""O I D E S"" -> ""OIDES"": not common.\n- ""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.\n- ""O I Z E S"" -> ""OIZES"": not common.\n\n""W I _ E S"":\n- ""W I P E S"" -> ""WIPES"": valid word.\n- ""W I D E S"" -> ""WIDES"": not common.\n- ""W I K E S"" -> K absent -> invalid (from guess 4).\n\n""PI I _ E S"": \n- ""PI I E S"" -> ""PIES"": 4 letters.\n- ""PI I D E S"" -> ""PIDES"": not common.\n- ""PI I M E S"" -> ""PIMES"": not a word.\n- ""PI I Z E S"" -> ""PIZES"": not common.\n\n""J I _ E S"":\n- ""J I V E S"" -> V absent -> invalid.\n- ""J I M E S"" -> ""JIMES"": not common.\n\n""F I _ E S"":\n- ""F I D E S"" -> ""FIDES"": valid? F-I-D-E-S? That\'s 5 letters? Actually, ""FIDES"" is 5 letters: F-I-D-E-S? No, F-I-D-E-S is 5 letters? F-I-D-E-S? Actually, it\'s F-I-D-E-S? That\'s 5: F, I, D, E, S. But ""FIDES"" is usually spelled F-I-D-E-S? I think it\'s accepted.\n\nBut let\'s check the dictionary: ""Fides"" is not common, but ""FIDES"" might be accepted as a variant of ""fides"" (plural of fidel). But we can use ""FIDES"".\n\nHowever, we have to avoid L? L is absent, so ""FIDES"" has D, which is available.\n\nBut we have to see.\n\nSimilarly, ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> valid? Yes, meaning sidewalks or city blocks? It\'s accepted.\n\nBut we have to choose.\n\nWe can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S -> tests D and M.\n\nOr ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.\n\nOr ""MIDES"": M-I-D-E-S -> tests M and D.\n\nWe can also try ""PIKES"": but K is absent -> invalid.\n\nHow about ""WIPES"": W-I-P-E-S -> tests W and P.\n\nOr ""BIKES"": but B and K are absent -> invalid.\n\nSo we have a few candidates: ""DIMES"", ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", etc.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nWe can also consider that the third letter might be a vowel? But we have I and E, so it might be a consonant.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has the form _ I _ E S, but we have to use letters that are not absent.\n\nBut we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""D I E E S"" -> but that would be ""DIES"" with an extra E? Not a word.\n\nSo I think we should try ""WIPES"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe can try ""DIMES"": D-I-M-E-S.\n\nBut ""DIMES"" is less common.\n\n""WIPES"" is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""MIDES"" is common.\n\nBut let me check: we have not used P, W, D, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"" to test W and P.\n\nIf we guess ""WIPES"", we test W at position 1 and P at position 3.\n\nIf the word is ""WIPES"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on W and P.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DIMES"", we test D and M.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that the secret word might be ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nSince we have only two possibilities?

""O ILES"" has L -> invalid.\n\n""Q I _ E S"": ""Q I P E S"" -> ""QUIPS"" -> not ending with ES? ""QUIPS"" ends with PS.\n\nWe need to end with ES.\n\n""O I P E S"" -> ""OIPES"": not a word.\n\nSo I think the main candidates are ""WIPES"", ""MIDES"", ""DIMES"", ""SIZES"", etc.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"".\n\nBut let me see the feedback we would get.\n\nIf we guess ""WIPES"":\n- If the word is ""WIPES"", we win.\n- If not, then we get feedback on W and P.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.\n\nBut we don\'t have such a word.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nWe can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.\n\nBut I think ""WIPES"" is a good choice because W and P are common.\n\nBut let me check: we have not used W, P, D, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""WIPES"".\n\nIf we guess ""WIPES"" and it\'s not the word, then we know:\n- If W is absent, then the word must be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".\n- If P is absent, then it could be ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".\n- If both W and P are absent, then we have ""DIMES"" or ""SIZES"".\n\nThen we can guess accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DIMES"" and it\'s not, then we know D and M are absent? Or at least, if D and M are absent, then it must be ""WIPES"" or ""SIZES"".\n\nBut if D and M are absent, then ""WIPES"" is a candidate.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""WIPES"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not missing ""DIMES"" or ""MIDES"".\n\nWe can also try ""MIDES"".\n\nBut I think ""WIPES"" is a common word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""WIPES"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to write it.\n\nSo <guess>wipes</guess>\n\nBut wait, we have to consider: the secret word might be ""SIZES"", but then we would have S at position 1. But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nIn ""SIZES"", we have S at position 1 and 5. So if we guess ""SIZES"", then:\n- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓, else if S is only at position 5, we get - (if S is in the word but not at 1), but we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1 and the secret word has only one S, then we would get x for position 1, and then we know S is at position 5.\n\nBut we are trying to find the word.\n\nWe can try ""SIZES"".\n\nBut it has Z, which is rare.\n\nWe can avoid and try ""WIPES"" or ""MIDES"".\n\nI think ""WIPES"" is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is _ I _ E S (position 2: I, position 4: E, position 5: S).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K (all marked ""x"" at some point).\n- **E constraints**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"", ""eight"", and ""lives"" feedback). Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 4 is now confirmed as E, so E must be in position 3. But position 3 cannot be E because:\n  - If E were in position 3, the word would be _ I E E S. However, no common English word ends with ""EES"" (e.g., ""TREES"" has absent letters).\n  - Moreover, in ""lives"" (Guess 3), we had E in position 4 (correct) and no E in position 3, so we never tested position 3 directly.\n\n- **Third position constraints**: Must be a letter not in {C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, E} (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **First position constraints**: Similarly, must be a letter not in the absent list and not E (since E is fixed at position 4). Possible letters: D, F, J, M, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nGiven the pattern _ I _ E S, the most common valid words are:\n- **WIPES** (W I P E S): Tests W and P.\n- **MIDES** (M I D E S): Tests M and D.\n- **DIMES** (D I M E S): Tests D and M.\n- **SIZES** (S I Z E S): Tests S and Z (but S is already known to be in position 5, so if S is in position 1, it would be a duplicate; Z is uncommon).\n\n**Strategy**: Prioritize **""WIPES""** because:\n- It tests two new common letters: **W** (position 1) and **P** (position 3).\n- It avoids rare letters (Z in ""SIZES"").\n- If correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on W and P will confirm if they are present or absent, narrowing options to ""MIDES"" or ""DIMES"" for the next guess.\n\n<guess>wipes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: eight -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: lives -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(x) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 5: wipes -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>

  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - W and P are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word is: _ I _ E S
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, W, P

Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We also know that the third letter cannot be E, because E is fixed at position 4, and we have no evidence of a second E. Moreover, we have tested many letters and never found an E in other positions.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] E S

With letter1 and letter3 from the available set.

We can list possible words:

- ""DIMES"": D I M E S -> tests D and M.
- ""MIDES"": M I D E S -> tests M and D. (But note: ""MIDES"" is a valid word? It might be accepted as a variant of ""mide"" or as a plural? In Wordle, it is sometimes accepted.)
- ""FIDES"": F I D E S -> tests F and D. (Similar, might be less common but accepted.)
- ""JIDES"": J I D E S -> tests J and D.
- ""OIDES"": O I D E S -> tests O and D.
- ""XENES"": X E N E S -> but N is absent -> invalid.
- ""ZINES"": Z I N E S -> N absent -> invalid.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So ""DIMES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", ""JIDES"", ""OIDES"" are all candidates.

Also, ""SIZES"": S I Z E S -> but S is at position 1? We know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, Z is a rare letter.

But let's consider: if we guess ""SIZES"", then:
- Position 1: S -> if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓, else if S is only at position 5, we get - (because S is in the word but not at 1, since we know S is at 5). But we know S is at 5, so if we put S at 1, and if the word has only one S, then we would get x for position 1 (if S is not at 1) and then we know S is at 5. But we are trying to find the word, so it might be acceptable.

But we have to avoid using absent letters. S is not absent, so it's allowed to use S in position 1, but we know S is at position 5, so if we use S at position 1, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. The rules don't say, but typically words can have duplicates.

However, we have not seen any duplicates so far, but it's possible.

To avoid confusion, we should avoid using S at position 1 because we know S is at position 5. So we should not use S in position 1 if we are not testing for duplication.

So for the pattern, we should not use S at position 1 if we are not trying to see if it's duplicated.

So we should avoid S at position 1 for the third letter? Actually, we are only concerned with position 1 and 3.

We can try ""DIMES"" to test D and M.

Or ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But we have to choose one.

We can also try ""FIDES"" or ""JIDES"" or ""OIDES"".

But let's see which letters are more common.

We can try ""DIMES"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing ""MIDES"" or ""FIDES"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a letter that might be common to multiple possibilities.

But we don't have such a word.

We can try ""DIMES"".

If we guess ""DIMES"":
- If the word is ""DIMES"", we win.
- If not, we get feedback on D and M.

Similarly, if we guess ""MIDES"", we test M and D.

But we have to pick one.

Since we have only a few options, we can try ""DIMES"".

But let me check: we have not used D, M, F, J, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""DIMES"".

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

So I'll go with ""DIMES"".

But let me see: if we guess ""DIMES"" and it's not, then we know D and M are absent? Or at least, if D and M are absent, then the word must be ""MIDES"" or ""FIDES"" or ""JIDES"" or ""OIDES"".

Then we can guess accordingly.

But we have to make a guess.

We can also try ""FIDES"" to test F and D.

But I think ""DIMES"" is a common word.

So I'll go with ""DIMES"".

But wait, we have to consider: the secret word might be ""SIZES"", but then we would have S at position 1. But we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 1, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we are trying to find the word, so we can try ""DIMES"".

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"".

But let me see the frequency.

We can try ""DIMES"".

If it's not, we get feedback on D and M.

Then we can try ""MIDES"" next.

But we have to make a guess.

So I'll choose ""DIMES"".

But note: we have to write it.

So <guess>dimes</guess>

But let me double-check.

The pattern: _ I _ E S

We are guessing ""DIMES"": D I M E S.

If the feedback shows:
- D: if absent, then we know D is not in the word. Then we can try ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", etc.

But we have to see.

Alternatively, we can try ""MIDES"" to test M and D.

But I think ""DIMES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have:

- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is _ I _ E S (position 2: I, position 4: E, position 5: S).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, W, P (all marked ""x"" at some point).
- **E constraints**: E cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (from ""crane"", ""eight"", and ""lives"" feedback). Position 2 is I, so E must be in position 3. However, position 3 cannot be E because:
  - If E were in position 3, the word would be _ I E E S, which is impossible (e.g., ""TREES"" has absent letters).
  - Moreover, we never tested position 3 with E directly.

- **Available letters for positions 1 and 3**: D, F, J, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z (since E and I are fixed, and absent letters are eliminated).

Possible words fitting the pattern include:
- **DIMES** (D I M E S): Tests D and M.
- **MIDES** (M I D E S): Tests M and D.
- **FIDES** (F I D E S): Tests F and D (less common).
- **JIDES** (J I D E S): Tests J and D.
- **OIDES** (O I D E S): Tests O and D.
- **SIZES** (S I Z E S): Tests S and Z (but S is already known to be in position 5, so if S is in position 1, it would be a duplicate; Z is uncommon).

**Strategy**: Prioritize **""DIMES""** because:
- It tests two new common letters: **D** (position 1) and **M** (position 3).
- It avoids rare letters (Z in ""Sizes"").
- If correct, we solve the word; if not, feedback on D and M will confirm if they are present or absent, narrowing options to ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", ""JIDES"", or ""OIDES"" for the next guess.

<guess>dimes</guess>",dimes,"We have feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""eight"" -> E(-), I(✓), G(x), H(x), T(x)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in the word but not in position 1 (and not in 5, from guess 1).
  - G, H, T are absent.

Guess 3: ""lives"" -> L(x), I(✓), V(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - L and V are absent.

Guess 4: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - B and K are absent.

Guess 5: ""wipes"" -> W(x), I(✓), P(x), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in position 2 (correct).
  - E is in position 4 (correct).
  - S is in position 5 (correct).
  - W and P are absent.

So now we know:
- The secret word is: _ I _ E S
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: S (fixed)
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, G, H, T, L, V, B, K, W, P

Therefore, the first and third letters must be from the remaining letters: D, F, J, M, O, Q, U, X, Y, Z

- ""ZINES"": Z I N E S -> N absent -> invalid.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So ""DIMES"", ""MIDES"", ""FIDES"", ""JIDES"", ""OIDES"" are all candidates.
