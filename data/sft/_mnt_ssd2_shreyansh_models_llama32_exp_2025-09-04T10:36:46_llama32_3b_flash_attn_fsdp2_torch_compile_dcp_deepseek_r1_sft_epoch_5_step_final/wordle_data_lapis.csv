We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3, which is the third letter, and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.

 However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to test more new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we haven't tried S, T, P.

 But we can also consider words without A in the third position.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? We don't know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.
 - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's.
 - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's? And we don't know about T and Y.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don't know if I and T are in the word.

 Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don't know if it has U, D, I, O.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So, we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).

 We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 However, we haven't tried P, S, T, Y.

 Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).

 But let's choose a word that is common.

 Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.

 We need a word that has A.

 Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.

 We cannot use N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let's index:
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's spell:
   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.

 We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.

 But we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word.

 Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.

 We cannot use E.

 How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A's? Also, we are repeating A.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A, S, T, A -> two A's. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.

 How about ""PASTY""? 
   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.

 But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it's a type of pie.

 Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.

 Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.

 We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven't tried H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.

 How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.

 But we don't know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.

 We are trying to cover more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.

 But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it's in the word, but we don't know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.

 We can try to put A in a position we haven't tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: 
   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.

 But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: 
   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.

 Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.

 Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it's in the word, but we don't know about others.

 We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.

 I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.

 We must avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.

 We need A.

 How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.

 This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.

 But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).

 But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's consider ""DAISY"":

   D: new
   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)
   I: new
   S: new
   Y: new

 This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

 Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.

 But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it's valid.

 Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if the word has M, I, L, S.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""DAISY"".

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won't get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A's position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. 

 ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.

 This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.

 We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).

 Which one to choose? 

 We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.

 By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for A.

 So, let's choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.

 But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's go with ""ADMIT"".

 However, note that we are using A again. But that's okay because we are trying to find the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A's and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.

 So, I choose ""ADMIT"".

 But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.

 We know that the secret word has an A, but we don't know if it has D, M, I, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A's? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.

 So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.

 We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.

 Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.

 So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""

 But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that's the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.

 So, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? 
   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.

 ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S's? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So, let's stick with ""ADMIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.

 But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.

 We can choose either.

 I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).

 So, let's go with ""ABOUT"".

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? 

 But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don't know about others.

 I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".

 However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.

 We have to make a choice.

 I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 Let's do it.

<guess>about</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""about""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3, which is the third letter, and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.

 However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to test more new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we haven't tried S, T, P.

 But we can also consider words without A in the third position.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? We don't know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.
 - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's.
 - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's? And we don't know about T and Y.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don't know if I and T are in the word.

 Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don't know if it has U, D, I, O.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So, we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).

 We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 However, we haven't tried P, S, T, Y.

 Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).

 But let's choose a word that is common.

 Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.

 We need a word that has A.

 Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.

 We cannot use N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let's index:
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's spell:
   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.

 We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.

 But we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word.

 Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.

 We cannot use E.

 How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A's? Also, we are repeating A.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A, S, T, A -> two A's. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.

 How about ""PASTY""? 
   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.

 But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it's a type of pie.

 Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.

 Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.

 We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven't tried H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.

 How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.

 But we don't know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.

 We are trying to cover more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.

 But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it's in the word, but we don't know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.

 We can try to put A in a position we haven't tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: 
   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.

 But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: 
   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.

 Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.

 Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it's in the word, but we don't know about others.

 We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.

 I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.

 We must avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.

 We need A.

 How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.

 This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.

 But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).

 But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's consider ""DAISY"":

   D: new
   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)
   I: new
   S: new
   Y: new

 This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

 Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.

 But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it's valid.

 Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if the word has M, I, L, S.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""DAISY"".

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won't get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A's position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. 

 ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.

 This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.

 We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).

 Which one to choose? 

 We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.

 By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for A.

 So, let's choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.

 But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's go with ""ADMIT"".

 However, note that we are using A again. But that's okay because we are trying to find the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A's and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.

 So, I choose ""ADMIT"".

 But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.

 We know that the secret word has an A, but we don't know if it has D, M, I, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A's? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.

 So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.

 We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.

 Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.

 So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""

 But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that's the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.

 So, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? 
   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.

 ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S's? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So, let's stick with ""ADMIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.

 But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.

 We can choose either.

 I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).

 So, let's go with ""ABOUT"".

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? 

 But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don't know about others.

 I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".

 However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.

 We have to make a choice.

 I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 Let's do it.

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""about""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.",Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3, which is the third letter, and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.

 However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to test more new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we haven't tried S, T, P.

 But we can also consider words without A in the third position.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? We don't know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.
 - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's.
 - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's? And we don't know about T and Y.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don't know if I and T are in the word.

 Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don't know if it has U, D, I, O.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So, we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).

 We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 However, we haven't tried P, S, T, Y.

 Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).

 But let's choose a word that is common.

 Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.

 We need a word that has A.

 Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.

 We cannot use N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let's index:
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's spell:
   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.

 We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.

 But we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word.

 Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.

 We cannot use E.

 How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A's? Also, we are repeating A.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A, S, T, A -> two A's. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.

 How about ""PASTY""? 
   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.

 But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it's a type of pie.

 Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.

 Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.

 We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven't tried H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.

 How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.

 But we don't know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.

 We are trying to cover more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.

 But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it's in the word, but we don't know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.

 We can try to put A in a position we haven't tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: 
   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.

 But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: 
   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.

 Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.

 Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it's in the word, but we don't know about others.

 We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.

 I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.

 We must avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.

 We need A.

 How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.

 This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.

 But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).

 But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's consider ""DAISY"":

   D: new
   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)
   I: new
   S: new
   Y: new

 This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

 Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.

 But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it's valid.

 Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if the word has M, I, L, S.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""DAISY"".

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won't get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A's position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. 

 ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.

 This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.

 We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).

 Which one to choose? 

 We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.

 By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for A.

 So, let's choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.

 But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's go with ""ADMIT"".

 However, note that we are using A again. But that's okay because we are trying to find the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A's and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.

 So, I choose ""ADMIT"".

 But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.

 We know that the secret word has an A, but we don't know if it has D, M, I, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A's? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.

 So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.

 We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.

 Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.

 So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""

 But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that's the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.

 So, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? 
   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.

 ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S's? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So, let's stick with ""ADMIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.

 But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.

 We can choose either.

 I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).

 So, let's go with ""ABOUT"".

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? 

 But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don't know about others.

 I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".

 However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.

 We have to make a choice.

 I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 Let's do it.

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""about""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.

However, we know that the word has an A, but we don\'t know if it has U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn\'t have A. We must include A because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So, we must include A.\n\n Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).\n\n We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don\'t know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried P, S, T, Y.\n\n Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).\n\n But let\'s choose a word that is common.\n\n Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.\n\n We need a word that has A.\n\n Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.\n\n We cannot use N.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let\'s index:\n   Position 1: P\n   Position 2: L\n   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let\'s spell:\n   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.\n\n We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? \n   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.\n\n But we don\'t know if U, D, I, O are in the word.\n\n Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.\n\n We cannot use E.\n\n How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A\'s?

This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.\n\n Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven\'t tried H, S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.\n\n How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.\n\n But we don\'t know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.\n\n We are trying to cover more common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.\n\n But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.\n\n We can try to put A in a position we haven\'t tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: \n   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.\n\n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: \n   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.\n\n Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.\n\n Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know about others.\n\n We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.\n\n But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.\n\n I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.\n\n Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n We must avoid C.\n\n Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.\n\n We need A.\n\n How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.\n\n But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).\n\n But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""DAISY"":\n\n   D: new\n   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)\n   I: new\n   S: new\n   Y: new\n\n This tests 4 new letters and the known A.\n\n Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has M, I, L, S.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We\'ll go with ""DAISY"".\n\n But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won\'t get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A\'s position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. \n\n ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.\n\n This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.\n\n By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an \'x\', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn\'t get an \'x\' for A.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.\n\n But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ADMIT"".\n\n However, note that we are using A again. But that\'s okay because we are trying to find the position of A.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.\n\n So, I choose ""ADMIT"".\n\n But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.\n\n We know that the secret word has an A, but we don\'t know if it has D, M, I, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A\'s? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.\n\n So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.\n\n Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.\n\n We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.\n\n Both are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.\n\n So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters. \n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that\'s the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.\n\n So, we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? \n   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.\n\n How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S\'s? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So, let\'s stick with ""ADMIT"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.\n\n But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.\n\n We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.\n\n Also, we test B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.\n\n Both are valid.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, what we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2:
- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A's? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".

We must avoid T.

How about ""PASTY""? 
  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid T.

How about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it's the same word.

We need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.

How about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S's? Also, we don't know about S, but E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another idea: ""PALLY""? But two L's and we don't know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L's and we don't know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

How about ""PALSY""? 
  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.

But we don't know if L, S, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.

This seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).

So, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.

We can also consider A in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.

Avoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.

Position 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.

Another position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z's. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don't know about Z.

We want to test common letters.

Another word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A's and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: 
  D: new
  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)
  I: new
  L: new
  Y: new

This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

We can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.

Another: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don't have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

So, let's go with ""DAILY"".

But wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.

Another: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

How about position 5? 
  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z's and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.

But Z is not very common.

Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.

No.

""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.

No.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.

No.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.

We can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A's. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A's. If we get a '-' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an 'x' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will get either ✓ or '-'.

But we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.

Therefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

We can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.

No.

""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L's and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's.

But we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"".

So, the next guess is ""DAILY"".

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

This will give us information about these letters.

So, let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.
- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.

The word **""daily""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).
- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Reveal if D, I, L, or Y are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>daily</guess>",daily,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, what we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2:
- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A's? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".

We must avoid T.

How about ""PASTY""? 
  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid T.

How about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it's the same word.

We need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.

How about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S's? Also, we don't know about S, but E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another idea: ""PALLY""? But two L's and we don't know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L's and we don't know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

How about ""PALSY""? 
  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.

But we don't know if L, S, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.

This seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).

So, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.

We can also consider A in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.

Avoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.

Position 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.

Another position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z's. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don't know about Z.

We want to test common letters.

Another word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A's and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: 
  D: new
  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)
  I: new
  L: new
  Y: new

This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

We can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.

Another: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don't have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

So, let's go with ""DAILY"".

But wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.

Another: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

How about position 5? 
  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z's and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.

But Z is not very common.

Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.

No.

""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.

No.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.

No.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.

We can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A's. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A's. If we get a '-' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an 'x' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will get either ✓ or '-'.

But we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.

Therefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

We can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.

No.

""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L's and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's.

But we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"".

So, the next guess is ""DAILY"".

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

This will give us information about these letters.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.
- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.

The word **""daily""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).
- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3, which is the third letter, and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.

 However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to test more new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we haven't tried S, T, P.

 But we can also consider words without A in the third position.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? We don't know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.
 - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's.
 - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's? And we don't know about T and Y.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don't know if I and T are in the word.

 Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don't know if it has U, D, I, O.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So, we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).

 We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 However, we haven't tried P, S, T, Y.

 Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).

 But let's choose a word that is common.

 Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.

 We need a word that has A.

 Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.

 We cannot use N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let's index:
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's spell:
   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.

 We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.

 But we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word.

 Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.

 We cannot use E.

 How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A's? Also, we are repeating A.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A, S, T, A -> two A's. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.

 How about ""PASTY""? 
   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.

 But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it's a type of pie.

 Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.

 Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.

 We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven't tried H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.

 How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.

 But we don't know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.

 We are trying to cover more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.

 But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it's in the word, but we don't know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.

 We can try to put A in a position we haven't tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: 
   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.

 But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: 
   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.

 Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.

 Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it's in the word, but we don't know about others.

 We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.

 I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.

 We must avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.

 We need A.

 How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.

 This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.

 But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).

 But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's consider ""DAISY"":

   D: new
   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)
   I: new
   S: new
   Y: new

 This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

 Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.

 But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it's valid.

 Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if the word has M, I, L, S.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""DAISY"".

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won't get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A's position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. 

 ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.

 This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.

 We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).

 Which one to choose? 

 We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.

 By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for A.

 So, let's choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.

 But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's go with ""ADMIT"".

 However, note that we are using A again. But that's okay because we are trying to find the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A's and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.

 So, I choose ""ADMIT"".

 But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.

 We know that the secret word has an A, but we don't know if it has D, M, I, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A's? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.

 So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.

 We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.

 Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.

 So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""

 But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that's the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.

 So, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? 
   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.

 ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S's? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So, let's stick with ""ADMIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.

 But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.

 We can choose either.

 I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).

 So, let's go with ""ABOUT"".

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? 

 But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don't know about others.

 I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".

 However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.

 We have to make a choice.

 I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 Let's do it.

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""about""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.

<guess>about</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, what we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2:
- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A's? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".

We must avoid T.

How about ""PASTY""? 
  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid T.

How about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it's the same word.

We need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.

How about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S's? Also, we don't know about S, but E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another idea: ""PALLY""? But two L's and we don't know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L's and we don't know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

How about ""PALSY""? 
  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.

But we don't know if L, S, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.

This seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).

So, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.

We can also consider A in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.

Avoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.

Position 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.

Another position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z's. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don't know about Z.

We want to test common letters.

Another word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A's and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: 
  D: new
  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)
  I: new
  L: new
  Y: new

This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

We can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.

Another: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don't have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

So, let's go with ""DAILY"".

But wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.

Another: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

How about position 5? 
  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z's and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.

But Z is not very common.

Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.

No.

""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.

No.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.

No.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.

We can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A's. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A's. If we get a '-' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an 'x' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will get either ✓ or '-'.

But we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.

Therefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

We can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.

No.

""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L's and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's.

But we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"".

So, the next guess is ""DAILY"".

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

This will give us information about these letters.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.
- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.

The word **""daily""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).
- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Reveal if D, I, L, or Y are in the secret word and their positions.

Wait, let\'s index:\n   Position 1: P\n   Position 2: L\n   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let\'s spell:\n   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.\n\n We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? \n   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.\n\n But we don\'t know if U, D, I, O are in the word.\n\n Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.\n\n We cannot use E.\n\n How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A\'s?

This tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven\'t tried H, S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.\n\n How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.\n\n But we don\'t know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.\n\n We are trying to cover more common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.\n\n But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.\n\n We can try to put A in a position we haven\'t tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: \n   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.\n\n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: \n   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.\n\n Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.\n\n Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know about others.\n\n We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.\n\n But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.\n\n I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.\n\n Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n We must avoid C.\n\n Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.\n\n We need A.\n\n How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.\n\n But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).\n\n But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""DAISY"":\n\n   D: new\n   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)\n   I: new\n   S: new\n   Y: new\n\n This tests 4 new letters and the known A.\n\n Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has M, I, L, S.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We\'ll go with ""DAISY"".\n\n But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won\'t get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A\'s position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. \n\n ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.\n\n This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.\n\n By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an \'x\', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn\'t get an \'x\' for A.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.\n\n But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ADMIT"".\n\n However, note that we are using A again. But that\'s okay because we are trying to find the position of A.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.\n\n So, I choose ""ADMIT"".\n\n But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.\n\n We know that the secret word has an A, but we don\'t know if it has D, M, I, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A\'s? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.\n\n So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.\n\n Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.\n\n We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.\n\n Both are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.\n\n So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters. \n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that\'s the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.\n\n So, we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? \n   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.\n\n How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S\'s? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So, let\'s stick with ""ADMIT"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.\n\n But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.\n\n We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.\n\n Also, we test B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.\n\n Both are valid. I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? \n\n But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don\'t know about others.\n\n I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".\n\n However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.\n\n We have to make a choice.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test B, O, U, T.\n\n Let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""about""** fits these criteria:\n- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).\n- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.\n  B: x (not in word)\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, what we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n- Uses new common letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2:\n- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A\'s? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".\n\nWe must avoid T.\n\nHow about ""PASTY""? \n  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.\n\nWe need to avoid T.\n\nHow about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it\'s the same word.\n\nWe need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.\n\nHow about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S\'s? Also, we don\'t know about S, but E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nAnother idea: ""PALLY""? But two L\'s and we don\'t know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L\'s and we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nHow about ""PALSY""? \n  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L, S, Y are in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY""? \n  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.\n\nWe can also consider A in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.\n\nAvoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.\n\nPosition 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.\n\nAnother position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z\'s. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don\'t know about Z.\n\nWe want to test common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A\'s and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: \n  D: new\n  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)\n  I: new\n  L: new\n  Y: new\n\nThis tests 4 new letters and the known A.\n\nWe can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.\n\nAnother: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A\'s and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don\'t have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So it\'s acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.\n\nTherefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe also test D, I, L, Y.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""DAILY"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.\n\nAnother: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.\n\nHow about position 5? \n  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z\'s and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.\n\nBut Z is not very common.\n\nAnother: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A\'s and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.\n\nWe can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A\'s. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A\'s. If we get a \'-\' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an \'x\' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we will get either ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nBut we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.\n\nTherefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.\n\n""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L\'s and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.\n\nWe can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two L\'s.\n\nBut we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""DAILY"".\n\nSo, the next guess is ""DAILY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe also test D, I, L, Y.\n\nThis will give us information about these letters.\n\nSo, let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.\n- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""daily""** fits perfectly:\n- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).\n- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).\n- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).\n- Reveal if D, I, L, or Y are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>daily</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""daily""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  L: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  Y: x (not in word)

So, what we know now:

1. The secret word has A in position 2. (From the ✓ in ""daily"")
2. The secret word contains I and L, but not in position 3 and 4 respectively. (From the '-' in ""daily"")
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.
4. Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now we have A in position 2) and from guess 2 that A is not in position 1 (which we know because A is in position 2).

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 2 is A.
- The word contains I and L, but not in positions 3 and 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, I, L, Y.

We need to find a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains I and L (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Also, we know that I is not in position 3 and L is not in position 4.

So, the word pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not forbidden and that include I and L.

The word must have I and L, and we have two positions to fill: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

We know that I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 4, so L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we know so far? Not necessarily, because we don't know about the other letters. We have two more letters to find? Actually, we know the word has A (in pos2), I, L, and two more letters.

We have two more letters to discover because the word is 5 letters.

We also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters.

So, we need to choose a word that has:
- Position 2: A
- Contains I and L (each at least once, but possibly more? We don't know about duplicates)
- And two other letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others.

We also have to consider the positions for I and L.

I cannot be in position 3 (from ""daily"") and L cannot be in position 4.

So, for I: possible positions: 1, 4, 5.
For L: possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

But note: if we put I in position 1, then L can be in 3 or 5. If we put I in position 4, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 5. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 4? But L cannot be in 4? Wait, from ""daily"", L was in position 4 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. So L can be in 1, 3, or 5.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in the second position and contain I and L.

Possible words:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but we have to check the positions.
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: I -> but we know I cannot be in position 3? From ""daily"", I was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3. Therefore, ""MAILS"" is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

- ""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S -> but then I is missing? We need to include I. So no.

- ""IALs"": I, A, L, S -> but that's only 4 letters? We need 5. ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""LAPIS"": L, A, P, I, S -> positions: 
  1: L
  2: A
  3: P
  4: I
  5: S
  This avoids the forbidden letters? 
  L: allowed, A: fixed, P: allowed, I: allowed, S: allowed.
  But we have to check the positions: 
  I is in position 4, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3). 
  L is in position 1, which is allowed (since we know it's not in 4, and here it's in 1).

  So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.

- ""SALAD"": but we have two A's? And D is forbidden. Also, we have A in position 2 and then A again? But D is forbidden.

- ""PALIS"": P, A, L, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: I
  5: S
  This seems good. 
  L is in position 3: which is allowed (since L can be in 1,3,5 and we haven't tried position 3 for L). 
  I is in position 4: which is allowed (since I can be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tried 4 for I).

  But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, A, L, I, S -> none of these are forbidden (C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y are forbidden). So ""PALIS"" is a candidate.

- ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> similar to ""PALIS"", but with M.

  But ""MALIS"" is a word? Yes, meaning mistakes or errors.

- ""FALIS"": not a common word.

- ""GALIS"": not common.

- ""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: H
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

- ""WAILS"": same issue.

- ""RAILS"": but R is forbidden.

- ""TAILS"": T is forbidden.

- ""DAISY"": but D and Y are forbidden.

- ""PAIS"": only 4 letters.

So, let's consider ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". But we also have to think of words with A in position 2 and I and L.

Another word: ""LAICS"": L, A, I, C, S -> but C is forbidden.

""LAUFS"": but U and F? U is forbidden.

""LAIRS"": R forbidden.

""LAMIN"": but N is forbidden.

""LAPSE"": E and S? E is forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are candidates.

But note: in ""PALIS"", we have:
  P (position 1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

We know that L is not in position 4 (from ""daily"") but we are putting L in position 3, which is allowed. And I is in position 4, which is allowed.

Similarly, for ""MALIS"": M (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, etc.

We can also consider words that put I and L in different positions.

For example, put I in position 1 and L in position 5? 
  ""IALS"" is 4 letters.

""ILium"": but U is forbidden and it's not common.

""ILACI"": but C and I in position 1? But C is forbidden.

""VALID"": but V, A, L, I, D -> D is forbidden.

""VALID"" has D, which is forbidden.

""GAVIL"": not a word.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAIL"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SALAD"" is invalid because of D and two A's.

""PALMY"": but Y is forbidden.

""PALMS"": P, A, L, M, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: M
  5: S
  This word: 
  - P: new
  - A: fixed
  - L: in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5)
  - M: new
  - S: new
  And it includes I? No, it doesn't have I. But we know the word must have I. So this is invalid.

We must include I.

So, we need a word that has I and L, with A in position 2.

We have ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". Also, ""PALIS"" is a word (plural of palis, meaning palis or picket fences).

Another word: ""HAILS"" is invalid because of I in position 3.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: M
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

""TAILS"": T forbidden.

""FAILS"": F, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: F
  2: A
  3: I -> again, I in position 3 is not allowed.

So, we must avoid putting I in position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, we must not put I in position 3 and not put L in position 4.

So, for ""PALIS"": 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: L -> allowed? Yes, because L can be in 3.
  Position 4: I -> allowed? Yes, because I can be in 4.
  Position 5: S

This is valid.

Similarly, ""MALIS"":
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: S

Both ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are valid.

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, or the other letters.

We can also consider ""SALIS"": but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's? And A in position 2. But then I is in position 4? 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are repeating S. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are better because they have all distinct letters except A, L, I, S? Actually, ""PALIS"" has P, A, L, I, S -> all distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> distinct.

But note: we have already used S in ""crane"" and ""about""? No, we haven't. ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E; ""about"" had A,B,O,U,T; ""daily"" had D,A,I,L,Y. So S is new.

We can choose either.

But we also have to consider that we know I is in the word but not in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 4. In ""PALIS"", we have L in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable.

In ""MALIS"", same positions.

But what if the word has I in position 1? Then we haven't tested that.

We can try to put I in position 1.

For example, ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""ILAC"": 4 letters.

""ILIAD"": but D is forbidden.

""ILIAD"": has D? Yes, D is forbidden.

""VALID"": has D, forbidden.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but I is in position 3? 
  M (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5) -> but I in position 3 is not allowed (from ""daily"", I cannot be in 3). And also, L is in position 4? But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from ""daily""). So both positions are forbidden for these letters? 

Wait, no: for I, we cannot put it in position 3. For L, we cannot put it in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", if we put I in position 3, that is not allowed because we know I is not in position 3. And L in position 4 is not allowed. So ""MAILS"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""AILIS"" (if valid) is not common.

Another word: ""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

""LARVA"": R and V? R is forbidden.

""LATKE"": T and K? T is forbidden.

So, it's hard to put I in position 1.

What about putting I in position 4 or 5?

We have ""PALIS"" (I in 4) and ""MALis"" (I in 4) and also ""PALIS"" has L in position 3 and I in 4.

But we can also consider putting L in position 1 and I in position 5? 
  ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

""LAMAS"": M, A, S -> but then we need I? We must have I. ""LAMAS"" has A in position 2? 
  L (1), A (2), M (3), A (4), S (5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

But we know A is in the word, so we are using one slot for A. We have two more letters to test.

In ""LAMAS"", we have A in position 2 and 4? So we are testing L, A, M, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, back to ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"".

We can also consider ""SALIS"": S, A, L, I, S -> but two S's? And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. Also, we are testing S multiple times. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"" are better.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""GAILS"": G, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  G (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)
  But I is in position 3: not allowed! Because we know I is not in position 3.

So invalid.

""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> I in position 3: invalid.

So, we must avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, the only options are words like ""PALIS"" (where I is in 4) or ""MALis"" (same).

Another word: ""PALIK"" -> not common and K is new, but we don't have I in position 3? 
  P, A, L, I, K -> positions: 
    1: P
    2: A
    3: L -> but L can be in 3? Yes, because we only know it's not in 4. 
    4: I
    5: K
  This is valid? But is ""PALIK"" a word? I don't think it's common. Let me check: I think ""palik"" is not standard. 

""PALIS"" is a valid word (plural of palis).

Similarly, ""MALis"" is valid (plural of malis, meaning mistakes? But also an adjective in some contexts?).

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's. And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> I is in 4, L in 3 (which is allowed). But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" or ""MALis"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""PALIS"" because it's a common word.

But let me confirm: 
  P: new
  A: fixed
  L: in position 3 (allowed, since we only know L is not in 4)
  I: in position 4 (allowed, since we know I is not in 3)
  S: new

This tests P, L, I, S and confirms A.

But we already know A is in position 2, so we are mainly testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PALMS"": but M and S? And I is missing.

We need I.

""PALIS"" has I in position 4.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and I in position 4. But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" to test P, L, I, S.

But we also have to consider that L is in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, I is in position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters. We are not.

So, the next guess: ""PALIS""

But let me double-check: 
  P: not forbidden
  A: in word, but we know position 2 is A, so we are using that.
  L: in word, and we are putting it in position 3 (which is allowed).
  I: in word, putting it in position 4 (allowed).
  S: not forbidden.

So, it should be valid.

Alternatively, we can try ""MAFIA"", but F and A? But ""MAFIA"" has A in position 2? 
  M (1), A (2), F (3), I (4), A (5) -> but two A's? And we are testing M, F, I, and A again. We know A is in position 2, so we are using that. But we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

Another word: ""GALAS"": G, A, L, A, S -> two A's? And we are testing G, L, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

We'll go with ""PALIS"".

So, the guess is ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. And we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing S in two positions? But we are only testing one new letter (S) because the other S is repeated.

Whereas in ""PALIS"", we have all distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S. So we test P, L, I, S, and A.

We know A is in position 2, so we are testing P, L, I, S.

This is better.

Similarly, ""MALis"" is also distinct.

But ""PALIS"" is more common? 

I think both are acceptable. Let me pick ""PALIS"".

So, the next guess is ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PANIC"" -> but N and C are forbidden.

No.

""PAPAL"": P, A, P, A, L -> but A in position 2 and 4? And L in position 5. But we are repeating P and A. And we don't have I? We must include I.

We must have I.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is the best.

But let me think of ""PAWIS"": P, A, W, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: W
  4: I
  5: S
  This is valid? ""PAWIS"" is a word? I think not. 

""PAWIS"" is not standard.

""PALIS"" is the plural of palis, which is acceptable.

So, I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1? We haven't tried that.

But we can try in the next guess if needed.

We have 6 tries, so we can test.

But we are making progress.

Another word: ""MANIS"": M, A, N, I, S -> but N is forbidden.

No.

So, ""PALIS"" it is.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's. We are testing S, but we are repeating S. So we test S only once (in position 1 or 5) and then the other S is known to be in the word? But we don't know if there are duplicate S.

We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

We can also consider ""HAIL"": 4 letters.

So, I think we should guess ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm the feedback we have: 
  We know A is in position 2.
  We know I is in the word but not in position 3.
  We know L is in the word but not in position 4.
  We know the word has I and L.

So, with ""PALIS"", we are testing:
  Position 1: P
  Position 3: L -> we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it can be in position 3.
  Position 4: I -> testing if I is in position 4.
  Position 5: S

We also test P.

If we get a ✓ for P, then P is in the word and in position 1.

If we get a '-' for P, then P is in the word but not in position 1.

Similarly for the others.

This will give us more information.

So, I choose ""PALIS"".

But note: we are putting L in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, we are putting I in position 4, which we haven't tried.

So, let's do it.

<guess>palis</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓).
- **I** and **L** are in the word but **not in position 3** (from ""daily"" -) and **not in position 4** (from ""daily"" -), respectively.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Known letters**: A (pos2), I, L are present, with I not in pos3 and L not in pos4.

The word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in position 2**.
- Must include **I and L** (since they are confirmed present).
- I cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.
- Avoid all forbidden letters.

**""palis""** is a valid guess:
- **P** (new) in position 1.
- **A** (confirmed) in position 2.
- **L** in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5).
- **I** in position 4 (allowed, since I can be in 1,4,5 and not in 3).
- **S** (new) in position 5.

This tests new letters (P, S) and checks positions for I and L.

<guess>palis</guess>",palis,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""daily""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  L: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  Y: x (not in word)

So, what we know now:

1. The secret word has A in position 2. (From the ✓ in ""daily"")
2. The secret word contains I and L, but not in position 3 and 4 respectively. (From the '-' in ""daily"")
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.
4. Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now we have A in position 2) and from guess 2 that A is not in position 1 (which we know because A is in position 2).

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 2 is A.
- The word contains I and L, but not in positions 3 and 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, I, L, Y.

We need to find a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains I and L (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Also, we know that I is not in position 3 and L is not in position 4.

So, the word pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not forbidden and that include I and L.

The word must have I and L, and we have two positions to fill: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

We know that I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 4, so L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we know so far? Not necessarily, because we don't know about the other letters. We have two more letters to find? Actually, we know the word has A (in pos2), I, L, and two more letters.

We have two more letters to discover because the word is 5 letters.

We also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters.

So, we need to choose a word that has:
- Position 2: A
- Contains I and L (each at least once, but possibly more? We don't know about duplicates)
- And two other letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others.

We also have to consider the positions for I and L.

I cannot be in position 3 (from ""daily"") and L cannot be in position 4.

So, for I: possible positions: 1, 4, 5.
For L: possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

But note: if we put I in position 1, then L can be in 3 or 5. If we put I in position 4, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 5. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 4? But L cannot be in 4? Wait, from ""daily"", L was in position 4 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. So L can be in 1, 3, or 5.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in the second position and contain I and L.

Possible words:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but we have to check the positions.
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: I -> but we know I cannot be in position 3? From ""daily"", I was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3. Therefore, ""MAILS"" is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

- ""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S -> but then I is missing? We need to include I. So no.

- ""IALs"": I, A, L, S -> but that's only 4 letters? We need 5. ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""LAPIS"": L, A, P, I, S -> positions: 
  1: L
  2: A
  3: P
  4: I
  5: S
  This avoids the forbidden letters? 
  L: allowed, A: fixed, P: allowed, I: allowed, S: allowed.
  But we have to check the positions: 
  I is in position 4, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3). 
  L is in position 1, which is allowed (since we know it's not in 4, and here it's in 1).

  So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.

- ""SALAD"": but we have two A's? And D is forbidden. Also, we have A in position 2 and then A again? But D is forbidden.

- ""PALIS"": P, A, L, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: I
  5: S
  This seems good. 
  L is in position 3: which is allowed (since L can be in 1,3,5 and we haven't tried position 3 for L). 
  I is in position 4: which is allowed (since I can be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tried 4 for I).

  But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, A, L, I, S -> none of these are forbidden (C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y are forbidden). So ""PALIS"" is a candidate.

- ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> similar to ""PALIS"", but with M.

  But ""MALIS"" is a word? Yes, meaning mistakes or errors.

- ""FALIS"": not a common word.

- ""GALIS"": not common.

- ""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: H
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

- ""WAILS"": same issue.

- ""RAILS"": but R is forbidden.

- ""TAILS"": T is forbidden.

- ""DAISY"": but D and Y are forbidden.

- ""PAIS"": only 4 letters.

So, let's consider ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". But we also have to think of words with A in position 2 and I and L.

Another word: ""LAICS"": L, A, I, C, S -> but C is forbidden.

""LAUFS"": but U and F? U is forbidden.

""LAIRS"": R forbidden.

""LAMIN"": but N is forbidden.

""LAPSE"": E and S? E is forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are candidates.

But note: in ""PALIS"", we have:
  P (position 1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

We know that L is not in position 4 (from ""daily"") but we are putting L in position 3, which is allowed. And I is in position 4, which is allowed.

Similarly, for ""MALIS"": M (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, etc.

We can also consider words that put I and L in different positions.

For example, put I in position 1 and L in position 5? 
  ""IALS"" is 4 letters.

""ILium"": but U is forbidden and it's not common.

""ILACI"": but C and I in position 1? But C is forbidden.

""VALID"": but V, A, L, I, D -> D is forbidden.

""VALID"" has D, which is forbidden.

""GAVIL"": not a word.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAIL"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SALAD"" is invalid because of D and two A's.

""PALMY"": but Y is forbidden.

""PALMS"": P, A, L, M, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: M
  5: S
  This word: 
  - P: new
  - A: fixed
  - L: in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5)
  - M: new
  - S: new
  And it includes I? No, it doesn't have I. But we know the word must have I. So this is invalid.

We must include I.

So, we need a word that has I and L, with A in position 2.

We have ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". Also, ""PALIS"" is a word (plural of palis, meaning palis or picket fences).

Another word: ""HAILS"" is invalid because of I in position 3.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: M
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

""TAILS"": T forbidden.

""FAILS"": F, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: F
  2: A
  3: I -> again, I in position 3 is not allowed.

So, we must avoid putting I in position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, we must not put I in position 3 and not put L in position 4.

So, for ""PALIS"": 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: L -> allowed? Yes, because L can be in 3.
  Position 4: I -> allowed? Yes, because I can be in 4.
  Position 5: S

This is valid.

Similarly, ""MALIS"":
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: S

Both ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are valid.

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, or the other letters.

We can also consider ""SALIS"": but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's? And A in position 2. But then I is in position 4? 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are repeating S. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are better because they have all distinct letters except A, L, I, S? Actually, ""PALIS"" has P, A, L, I, S -> all distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> distinct.

But note: we have already used S in ""crane"" and ""about""? No, we haven't. ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E; ""about"" had A,B,O,U,T; ""daily"" had D,A,I,L,Y. So S is new.

We can choose either.

But we also have to consider that we know I is in the word but not in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 4. In ""PALIS"", we have L in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable.

In ""MALIS"", same positions.

But what if the word has I in position 1? Then we haven't tested that.

We can try to put I in position 1.

For example, ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""ILAC"": 4 letters.

""ILIAD"": but D is forbidden.

""ILIAD"": has D? Yes, D is forbidden.

""VALID"": has D, forbidden.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but I is in position 3? 
  M (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5) -> but I in position 3 is not allowed (from ""daily"", I cannot be in 3). And also, L is in position 4? But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from ""daily""). So both positions are forbidden for these letters? 

Wait, no: for I, we cannot put it in position 3. For L, we cannot put it in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", if we put I in position 3, that is not allowed because we know I is not in position 3. And L in position 4 is not allowed. So ""MAILS"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""AILIS"" (if valid) is not common.

Another word: ""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

""LARVA"": R and V? R is forbidden.

""LATKE"": T and K? T is forbidden.

So, it's hard to put I in position 1.

What about putting I in position 4 or 5?

We have ""PALIS"" (I in 4) and ""MALis"" (I in 4) and also ""PALIS"" has L in position 3 and I in 4.

But we can also consider putting L in position 1 and I in position 5? 
  ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

""LAMAS"": M, A, S -> but then we need I? We must have I. ""LAMAS"" has A in position 2? 
  L (1), A (2), M (3), A (4), S (5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

But we know A is in the word, so we are using one slot for A. We have two more letters to test.

In ""LAMAS"", we have A in position 2 and 4? So we are testing L, A, M, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, back to ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"".

We can also consider ""SALIS"": S, A, L, I, S -> but two S's? And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. Also, we are testing S multiple times. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"" are better.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""GAILS"": G, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  G (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)
  But I is in position 3: not allowed! Because we know I is not in position 3.

So invalid.

""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> I in position 3: invalid.

So, we must avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, the only options are words like ""PALIS"" (where I is in 4) or ""MALis"" (same).

Another word: ""PALIK"" -> not common and K is new, but we don't have I in position 3? 
  P, A, L, I, K -> positions: 
    1: P
    2: A
    3: L -> but L can be in 3? Yes, because we only know it's not in 4. 
    4: I
    5: K
  This is valid? But is ""PALIK"" a word? I don't think it's common. Let me check: I think ""palik"" is not standard. 

""PALIS"" is a valid word (plural of palis).

Similarly, ""MALis"" is valid (plural of malis, meaning mistakes? But also an adjective in some contexts?).

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's. And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> I is in 4, L in 3 (which is allowed). But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" or ""MALis"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""PALIS"" because it's a common word.

But let me confirm: 
  P: new
  A: fixed
  L: in position 3 (allowed, since we only know L is not in 4)
  I: in position 4 (allowed, since we know I is not in 3)
  S: new

This tests P, L, I, S and confirms A.

But we already know A is in position 2, so we are mainly testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PALMS"": but M and S? And I is missing.

We need I.

""PALIS"" has I in position 4.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and I in position 4. But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" to test P, L, I, S.

But we also have to consider that L is in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, I is in position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters. We are not.

So, the next guess: ""PALIS""

But let me double-check: 
  P: not forbidden
  A: in word, but we know position 2 is A, so we are using that.
  L: in word, and we are putting it in position 3 (which is allowed).
  I: in word, putting it in position 4 (allowed).
  S: not forbidden.

So, it should be valid.

Alternatively, we can try ""MAFIA"", but F and A? But ""MAFIA"" has A in position 2? 
  M (1), A (2), F (3), I (4), A (5) -> but two A's? And we are testing M, F, I, and A again. We know A is in position 2, so we are using that. But we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

Another word: ""GALAS"": G, A, L, A, S -> two A's? And we are testing G, L, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

We'll go with ""PALIS"".

So, the guess is ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. And we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing S in two positions? But we are only testing one new letter (S) because the other S is repeated.

Whereas in ""PALIS"", we have all distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S. So we test P, L, I, S, and A.

We know A is in position 2, so we are testing P, L, I, S.

This is better.

Similarly, ""MALis"" is also distinct.

But ""PALIS"" is more common? 

I think both are acceptable. Let me pick ""PALIS"".

So, the next guess is ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PANIC"" -> but N and C are forbidden.

No.

""PAPAL"": P, A, P, A, L -> but A in position 2 and 4? And L in position 5. But we are repeating P and A. And we don't have I? We must include I.

We must have I.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is the best.

But let me think of ""PAWIS"": P, A, W, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: W
  4: I
  5: S
  This is valid? ""PAWIS"" is a word? I think not. 

""PAWIS"" is not standard.

""PALIS"" is the plural of palis, which is acceptable.

So, I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1? We haven't tried that.

But we can try in the next guess if needed.

We have 6 tries, so we can test.

But we are making progress.

Another word: ""MANIS"": M, A, N, I, S -> but N is forbidden.

No.

So, ""PALIS"" it is.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's. We are testing S, but we are repeating S. So we test S only once (in position 1 or 5) and then the other S is known to be in the word? But we don't know if there are duplicate S.

We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

We can also consider ""HAIL"": 4 letters.

So, I think we should guess ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm the feedback we have: 
  We know A is in position 2.
  We know I is in the word but not in position 3.
  We know L is in the word but not in position 4.
  We know the word has I and L.

So, with ""PALIS"", we are testing:
  Position 1: P
  Position 3: L -> we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it can be in position 3.
  Position 4: I -> testing if I is in position 4.
  Position 5: S

We also test P.

If we get a ✓ for P, then P is in the word and in position 1.

If we get a '-' for P, then P is in the word but not in position 1.

Similarly for the others.

This will give us more information.

So, I choose ""PALIS"".

But note: we are putting L in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, we are putting I in position 4, which we haven't tried.

So, let's do it.

<guess>palis</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓).
- **I** and **L** are in the word but **not in position 3** (from ""daily"" -) and **not in position 4** (from ""daily"" -), respectively.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Known letters**: A (pos2), I, L are present, with I not in pos3 and L not in pos4.

The word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in position 2**.
- Must include **I and L** (since they are confirmed present).
- I cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.
- Avoid all forbidden letters.

**""palis""** is a valid guess:
- **P** (new) in position 1.
- **A** (confirmed) in position 2.
- **L** in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5).
- **I** in position 4 (allowed, since I can be in 1,4,5 and not in 3).
- **S** (new) in position 5.

This tests new letters (P, S) and checks positions for I and L.",Guess 4: palis -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the first guess at position 3, which is the third letter, and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it's not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).

 Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.

 Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.

 However, note that the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven't tried.

 Some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.

 A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to test more new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

 Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we haven't tried S, T, P.

 But we can also consider words without A in the third position.

 Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:

 - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A's? We don't know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.
 - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A's.
 - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T's? And we don't know about T and Y.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don't know if I and T are in the word.

 Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don't know if it has U, D, I, O.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn't have A. We must include A because we know it's in the word.

 So, we must include A.

 Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).

 We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don't know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 However, we haven't tried P, S, T, Y.

 Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).

 But let's choose a word that is common.

 Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.

 We need a word that has A.

 Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.

 We cannot use N.

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let's index:
   Position 1: P
   Position 2: L
   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it's not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.

 In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let's spell:
   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.

 We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 How about ""AUDIO""? 
   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.

 But we don't know if U, D, I, O are in the word.

 Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.

 We cannot use E.

 How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.

 We must avoid N.

 Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A's? Also, we are repeating A.

 Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
   P, A, S, T, A -> two A's. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.

 How about ""PASTY""? 
   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.

 But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it's a type of pie.

 Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.

 Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.

 Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.

 We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven't tried H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.

 How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.

 But we don't know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.

 We are trying to cover more common letters.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.

 But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it's in the word, but we don't know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.

 We can try to put A in a position we haven't tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: 
   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.

 ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.

 But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: 
   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.

 Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.

 Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it's in the word, but we don't know about others.

 We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.

 But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.

 I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.

 Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.

 We must avoid C.

 Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.

 We need A.

 How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.

 This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.

 But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.

 Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).

 But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's consider ""DAISY"":

   D: new
   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)
   I: new
   S: new
   Y: new

 This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

 Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.

 But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it's valid.

 Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.

 But we don't know if the word has M, I, L, S.

 I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't know.

 We'll go with ""DAISY"".

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won't get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A's position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. 

 ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.

 This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.

 We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).

 Which one to choose? 

 We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.

 By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an 'x', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn't get an 'x' for A.

 So, let's choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.

 But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.

 But wait, we have to make sure we don't use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.

 So, let's go with ""ADMIT"".

 However, note that we are using A again. But that's okay because we are trying to find the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A's and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.

 So, I choose ""ADMIT"".

 But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.

 We know that the secret word has an A, but we don't know if it has D, M, I, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A's? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.

 So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.

 Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.

 We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.

 Both are valid.

 I'll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.

 So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""

 But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.

 We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven't tried and also includes other common letters. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that's the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.

 So, we must avoid position 3 for A.

 ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? 
   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.

 How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.

 ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S's? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.

 We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So, let's stick with ""ADMIT"".

 Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.

 But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.

 We can choose either.

 I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).

 So, let's go with ""ABOUT"".

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a '-', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 This is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.

 Both are valid. I'll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? 

 But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don't know about others.

 I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".

 However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.

 We have to make a choice.

 I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we test B, O, U, T.

 Let's do it.

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.

The word **""about""** fits these criteria:
- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.

This guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.

<guess>about</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

So, what we know:
- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.

We need to choose a new word that:
- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.
- Uses new common letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.

We also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.

Let's think of words that have A in position 2:
- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A's? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".

We must avoid T.

How about ""PASTY""? 
  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid T.

How about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it's the same word.

We need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.

How about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S's? Also, we don't know about S, but E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another idea: ""PALLY""? But two L's and we don't know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L's and we don't know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

How about ""PALSY""? 
  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.

But we don't know if L, S, Y are in the word.

Another word: ""DAILY""? 
  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.

This seems good.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).

So, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.

We can also consider A in position 4 or 5.

For example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.

Avoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.

Position 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.

Another position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z's. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don't know about Z.

We want to test common letters.

Another word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A's and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.

But let me check: 
  D: new
  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)
  I: new
  L: new
  Y: new

This tests 4 new letters and the known A.

We can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.

Another: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don't have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. So it's acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

So, let's go with ""DAILY"".

But wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.

Another: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.

It's hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.

How about position 5? 
  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z's and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.

But Z is not very common.

Another: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.

No.

""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.

No.

""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.

No.

""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A's and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.

We can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A's. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A's. If we get a '-' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an 'x' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be 'x'. So we will get either ✓ or '-'.

But we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.

Therefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.

We can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.

""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.

No.

""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L's and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.

We can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L's. We don't know if the word has two L's.

But we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.

Therefore, I choose ""DAILY"".

So, the next guess is ""DAILY"".

But note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.

We also test D, I, L, Y.

This will give us information about these letters.

So, let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.
- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.
- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.

The word **""daily""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).
- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).
- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.

This guess will help:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Reveal if D, I, L, or Y are in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>daily</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)
Guess 3: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""daily""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  L: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  Y: x (not in word)

So, what we know now:

1. The secret word has A in position 2. (From the ✓ in ""daily"")
2. The secret word contains I and L, but not in position 3 and 4 respectively. (From the '-' in ""daily"")
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.
4. Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now we have A in position 2) and from guess 2 that A is not in position 1 (which we know because A is in position 2).

Now, let's list the knowns:

- Position 2 is A.
- The word contains I and L, but not in positions 3 and 4.
- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, I, L, Y.

We need to find a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains I and L (since they are in the word, but we don't know their positions yet).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Also, we know that I is not in position 3 and L is not in position 4.

So, the word pattern so far: _ A _ _ _

We need to fill the blanks with letters that are not forbidden and that include I and L.

The word must have I and L, and we have two positions to fill: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

We know that I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
Similarly, L is in the word but not in position 4, so L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

But note: the word must have exactly the letters we know so far? Not necessarily, because we don't know about the other letters. We have two more letters to find? Actually, we know the word has A (in pos2), I, L, and two more letters.

We have two more letters to discover because the word is 5 letters.

We also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters.

So, we need to choose a word that has:
- Position 2: A
- Contains I and L (each at least once, but possibly more? We don't know about duplicates)
- And two other letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.

Available letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others.

We also have to consider the positions for I and L.

I cannot be in position 3 (from ""daily"") and L cannot be in position 4.

So, for I: possible positions: 1, 4, 5.
For L: possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

But note: if we put I in position 1, then L can be in 3 or 5. If we put I in position 4, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 5. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 4? But L cannot be in 4? Wait, from ""daily"", L was in position 4 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. So L can be in 1, 3, or 5.

But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

We need to form a valid English word.

Let's think of words that have A in the second position and contain I and L.

Possible words:

- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but we have to check the positions.
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: I -> but we know I cannot be in position 3? From ""daily"", I was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3. Therefore, ""MAILS"" is invalid because it puts I in position 3.

- ""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S -> but then I is missing? We need to include I. So no.

- ""IALs"": I, A, L, S -> but that's only 4 letters? We need 5. ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

- ""LAPIS"": L, A, P, I, S -> positions: 
  1: L
  2: A
  3: P
  4: I
  5: S
  This avoids the forbidden letters? 
  L: allowed, A: fixed, P: allowed, I: allowed, S: allowed.
  But we have to check the positions: 
  I is in position 4, which is allowed (since we only know it's not in 3). 
  L is in position 1, which is allowed (since we know it's not in 4, and here it's in 1).

  So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.

- ""SALAD"": but we have two A's? And D is forbidden. Also, we have A in position 2 and then A again? But D is forbidden.

- ""PALIS"": P, A, L, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: I
  5: S
  This seems good. 
  L is in position 3: which is allowed (since L can be in 1,3,5 and we haven't tried position 3 for L). 
  I is in position 4: which is allowed (since I can be in 1,4,5 and we haven't tried 4 for I).

  But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, A, L, I, S -> none of these are forbidden (C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y are forbidden). So ""PALIS"" is a candidate.

- ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> similar to ""PALIS"", but with M.

  But ""MALIS"" is a word? Yes, meaning mistakes or errors.

- ""FALIS"": not a common word.

- ""GALIS"": not common.

- ""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: H
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

- ""WAILS"": same issue.

- ""RAILS"": but R is forbidden.

- ""TAILS"": T is forbidden.

- ""DAISY"": but D and Y are forbidden.

- ""PAIS"": only 4 letters.

So, let's consider ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". But we also have to think of words with A in position 2 and I and L.

Another word: ""LAICS"": L, A, I, C, S -> but C is forbidden.

""LAUFS"": but U and F? U is forbidden.

""LAIRS"": R forbidden.

""LAMIN"": but N is forbidden.

""LAPSE"": E and S? E is forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are candidates.

But note: in ""PALIS"", we have:
  P (position 1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

We know that L is not in position 4 (from ""daily"") but we are putting L in position 3, which is allowed. And I is in position 4, which is allowed.

Similarly, for ""MALIS"": M (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, etc.

We can also consider words that put I and L in different positions.

For example, put I in position 1 and L in position 5? 
  ""IALS"" is 4 letters.

""ILium"": but U is forbidden and it's not common.

""ILACI"": but C and I in position 1? But C is forbidden.

""VALID"": but V, A, L, I, D -> D is forbidden.

""VALID"" has D, which is forbidden.

""GAVIL"": not a word.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAIL"": 4 letters.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SALAD"" is invalid because of D and two A's.

""PALMY"": but Y is forbidden.

""PALMS"": P, A, L, M, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: L
  4: M
  5: S
  This word: 
  - P: new
  - A: fixed
  - L: in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5)
  - M: new
  - S: new
  And it includes I? No, it doesn't have I. But we know the word must have I. So this is invalid.

We must include I.

So, we need a word that has I and L, with A in position 2.

We have ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". Also, ""PALIS"" is a word (plural of palis, meaning palis or picket fences).

Another word: ""HAILS"" is invalid because of I in position 3.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: M
  2: A
  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.

""TAILS"": T forbidden.

""FAILS"": F, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  1: F
  2: A
  3: I -> again, I in position 3 is not allowed.

So, we must avoid putting I in position 3.

Therefore, in our guess, we must not put I in position 3 and not put L in position 4.

So, for ""PALIS"": 
  Position 1: P
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: L -> allowed? Yes, because L can be in 3.
  Position 4: I -> allowed? Yes, because I can be in 4.
  Position 5: S

This is valid.

Similarly, ""MALIS"":
  Position 1: M
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: L
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: S

Both ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are valid.

But we don't know if the word has P, M, S, or the other letters.

We can also consider ""SALIS"": but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's? And A in position 2. But then I is in position 4? 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but two S's? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, we are repeating S. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are better because they have all distinct letters except A, L, I, S? Actually, ""PALIS"" has P, A, L, I, S -> all distinct? Yes.

Similarly, ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> distinct.

But note: we have already used S in ""crane"" and ""about""? No, we haven't. ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E; ""about"" had A,B,O,U,T; ""daily"" had D,A,I,L,Y. So S is new.

We can choose either.

But we also have to consider that we know I is in the word but not in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 4. In ""PALIS"", we have L in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable.

In ""MALIS"", same positions.

But what if the word has I in position 1? Then we haven't tested that.

We can try to put I in position 1.

For example, ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""ILAC"": 4 letters.

""ILIAD"": but D is forbidden.

""ILIAD"": has D? Yes, D is forbidden.

""VALID"": has D, forbidden.

""JAIL"": 4 letters.

""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but I is in position 3? 
  M (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5) -> but I in position 3 is not allowed (from ""daily"", I cannot be in 3). And also, L is in position 4? But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from ""daily""). So both positions are forbidden for these letters? 

Wait, no: for I, we cannot put it in position 3. For L, we cannot put it in position 4.

In ""MAILS"", if we put I in position 3, that is not allowed because we know I is not in position 3. And L in position 4 is not allowed. So ""MAILS"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""AILIS"" (if valid) is not common.

Another word: ""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

""LARVA"": R and V? R is forbidden.

""LATKE"": T and K? T is forbidden.

So, it's hard to put I in position 1.

What about putting I in position 4 or 5?

We have ""PALIS"" (I in 4) and ""MALis"" (I in 4) and also ""PALIS"" has L in position 3 and I in 4.

But we can also consider putting L in position 1 and I in position 5? 
  ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LARIS"": R forbidden.

""LAMAS"": M, A, S -> but then we need I? We must have I. ""LAMAS"" has A in position 2? 
  L (1), A (2), M (3), A (4), S (5) -> but we have two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

But we know A is in the word, so we are using one slot for A. We have two more letters to test.

In ""LAMAS"", we have A in position 2 and 4? So we are testing L, A, M, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, back to ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"".

We can also consider ""SALIS"": S, A, L, I, S -> but two S's? And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. Also, we are testing S multiple times. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"" are better.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""GAILS"": G, A, I, L, S -> positions: 
  G (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)
  But I is in position 3: not allowed! Because we know I is not in position 3.

So invalid.

""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> I in position 3: invalid.

So, we must avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, the only options are words like ""PALIS"" (where I is in 4) or ""MALis"" (same).

Another word: ""PALIK"" -> not common and K is new, but we don't have I in position 3? 
  P, A, L, I, K -> positions: 
    1: P
    2: A
    3: L -> but L can be in 3? Yes, because we only know it's not in 4. 
    4: I
    5: K
  This is valid? But is ""PALIK"" a word? I don't think it's common. Let me check: I think ""palik"" is not standard. 

""PALIS"" is a valid word (plural of palis).

Similarly, ""MALis"" is valid (plural of malis, meaning mistakes? But also an adjective in some contexts?).

But to be safe, let's choose a more common word.

Another word: ""SALIS"" -> but S, A, L, I, S -> two S's. And A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> I is in 4, L in 3 (which is allowed). But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" or ""MALis"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""PALIS"" because it's a common word.

But let me confirm: 
  P: new
  A: fixed
  L: in position 3 (allowed, since we only know L is not in 4)
  I: in position 4 (allowed, since we know I is not in 3)
  S: new

This tests P, L, I, S and confirms A.

But we already know A is in position 2, so we are mainly testing the other positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PALMS"": but M and S? And I is missing.

We need I.

""PALIS"" has I in position 4.

Another word: ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.

""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a good choice.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and I in position 4. But we are repeating S.

We can try ""PALIS"" to test P, L, I, S.

But we also have to consider that L is in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, I is in position 4.

So, let's go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters. We are not.

So, the next guess: ""PALIS""

But let me double-check: 
  P: not forbidden
  A: in word, but we know position 2 is A, so we are using that.
  L: in word, and we are putting it in position 3 (which is allowed).
  I: in word, putting it in position 4 (allowed).
  S: not forbidden.

So, it should be valid.

Alternatively, we can try ""MAFIA"", but F and A? But ""MAFIA"" has A in position 2? 
  M (1), A (2), F (3), I (4), A (5) -> but two A's? And we are testing M, F, I, and A again. We know A is in position 2, so we are using that. But we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

Another word: ""GALAS"": G, A, L, A, S -> two A's? And we are testing G, L, S, and A again. Not ideal.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

We'll go with ""PALIS"".

So, the guess is ""PALIS"".

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's and A in position 2. 
  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. And we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing S in two positions? But we are only testing one new letter (S) because the other S is repeated.

Whereas in ""PALIS"", we have all distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S. So we test P, L, I, S, and A.

We know A is in position 2, so we are testing P, L, I, S.

This is better.

Similarly, ""MALis"" is also distinct.

But ""PALIS"" is more common? 

I think both are acceptable. Let me pick ""PALIS"".

So, the next guess is ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? 
  For example, ""PANIC"" -> but N and C are forbidden.

No.

""PAPAL"": P, A, P, A, L -> but A in position 2 and 4? And L in position 5. But we are repeating P and A. And we don't have I? We must include I.

We must have I.

So, I think ""PALIS"" is the best.

But let me think of ""PAWIS"": P, A, W, I, S -> positions: 
  1: P
  2: A
  3: W
  4: I
  5: S
  This is valid? ""PAWIS"" is a word? I think not. 

""PAWIS"" is not standard.

""PALIS"" is the plural of palis, which is acceptable.

So, I'll go with ""PALIS"".

But note: we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1? We haven't tried that.

But we can try in the next guess if needed.

We have 6 tries, so we can test.

But we are making progress.

Another word: ""MANIS"": M, A, N, I, S -> but N is forbidden.

No.

So, ""PALIS"" it is.

But wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S's. We are testing S, but we are repeating S. So we test S only once (in position 1 or 5) and then the other S is known to be in the word? But we don't know if there are duplicate S.

We want to test new letters.

So, ""PALIS"" is better.

We can also consider ""HAIL"": 4 letters.

So, I think we should guess ""PALIS"".

But let me confirm the feedback we have: 
  We know A is in position 2.
  We know I is in the word but not in position 3.
  We know L is in the word but not in position 4.
  We know the word has I and L.

So, with ""PALIS"", we are testing:
  Position 1: P
  Position 3: L -> we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it can be in position 3.
  Position 4: I -> testing if I is in position 4.
  Position 5: S

We also test P.

If we get a ✓ for P, then P is in the word and in position 1.

If we get a '-' for P, then P is in the word but not in position 1.

Similarly for the others.

This will give us more information.

So, I choose ""PALIS"".

But note: we are putting L in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don't know if it can be in position 3. We haven't tried position 3 for L.

Similarly, we are putting I in position 4, which we haven't tried.

So, let's do it.

<guess>palis</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓).
- **I** and **L** are in the word but **not in position 3** (from ""daily"" -) and **not in position 4** (from ""daily"" -), respectively.
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Known letters**: A (pos2), I, L are present, with I not in pos3 and L not in pos4.

The word pattern is: _ A _ _ _

For the next guess:
- Must have **A in position 2**.
- Must include **I and L** (since they are confirmed present).
- I cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.
- Avoid all forbidden letters.

**""palis""** is a valid guess:
- **P** (new) in position 1.
- **A** (confirmed) in position 2.
- **L** in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5).
- **I** in position 4 (allowed, since I can be in 1,4,5 and not in 3).
- **S** (new) in position 5.

This tests new letters (P, S) and checks positions for I and L.

Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.\n\n Since we have only one letter known to be in the word (A), and it\'s not in position 3, we need to choose a new word that:\n 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it\'s in the word) but not in the third position.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n\n Also, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.\n\n We know the word is 5 letters and must include A. We can try to put A in a different position.\n\n Since in ""crane"" the A was in position 3 (index 2), we can try putting A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We also want to test other common letters.\n\n Let\'s consider a word that has A in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if A can be in first. Alternatively, we can try a word with A in a different position.\n\n However, note that the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. So it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n We also have to avoid C, R, N, E.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Some common letters we haven\'t used: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\n A good candidate might be a word like ""SALAD"", but that has two A\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we want to test more new letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"", but note that E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n\n We must avoid E, so let\'s avoid words with E.\n\n Another idea: ""PASTA"" - but note that we have A twice, and we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we haven\'t tried S, T, P.\n\n But we can also consider words without A in the third position.\n\n Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, N, E:\n\n - ""SALAD"": S, A, L, A, D -> but two A\'s? We don\'t know. Also, we are repeating A. We might get less information because of repetition.\n - ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> again two A\'s.\n - ""TASTY"": T, A, S, T, Y -> two T\'s? And we don\'t know about T and Y.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n How about ""PLAIT""? But that has I and T, and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we don\'t know if I and T are in the word.\n\n Another word: ""AUDIO"" -> but that has A in first position and avoids the forbidden letters. However, we know that the word has an A, but we don\'t know if it has U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STOMP"" but that doesn\'t have A. We must include A because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n So, we must include A.\n\n Let me try to think of words that have A and also include other common consonants and vowels (but avoiding E, and also C, R, N).\n\n We can try: ""PASTY"" (a type of pie) -> P, A, S, T, Y. But note: we don\'t know if Y is in the word. Also, we are avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we haven\'t tried P, S, T, Y.\n\n Another word: ""MASTY"" (not very common) or ""GAMUT"" (but has U and T, and avoids forbidden).\n\n But let\'s choose a word that is common.\n\n Alternatively, ""PAINT"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n How about ""LIGHT"" -> but no A.\n\n We need a word that has A.\n\n Let me try ""SLANT"" -> but N is forbidden and T is new. Also, we know N is not in the word.\n\n We cannot use N.\n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. This has A in the third position? Wait, let\'s index:\n   Position 1: P\n   Position 2: L\n   Position 3: A -> but we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback for the first guess said A was in the word but not in position 3. So we can try A in position 3 again? Actually, we cannot put A in position 3 again because we know it\'s not there. So we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n In ""PLAIT"", A is in position 3? Actually, let\'s spell:\n   P-L-A-I-T -> so A is in position 3. But we know A is not in position 3, so we cannot use that.\n\n We need a word that has A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n How about ""AUDIO""? \n   A in position 1, and then U, D, I, O.\n\n But we don\'t know if U, D, I, O are in the word.\n\n Another word: ""PAUSE"" -> but E is forbidden.\n\n We cannot use E.\n\n How about ""MANGO"" -> but M, A, N, G, O: N is forbidden, so no.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n Let me try ""TAPAS"" -> but S is new, and we have two A\'s? Also, we are repeating A.\n\n Alternatively, ""SALAD"" has A in positions 2 and 4? But we are repeating A.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible. So a word with only one A and four new letters would be ideal.\n\n How about ""PASTA""? \n   P, A, S, T, A -> two A\'s. We are testing P, S, T, and then A again. Not ideal.\n\n How about ""PASTY""? \n   P, A, S, T, Y -> only one A (in position 2) and four new letters. This seems good.\n\n But is ""PASTY"" a valid word? Yes, it\'s a type of pie.\n\n Alternatively, ""TAWNY"" -> T, A, W, N, Y -> but N is forbidden. So no.\n\n Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. This avoids the forbidden letters. And we test D, I, L, Y.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, L, Y are in the word.\n\n Another: ""HASTY"" -> H, A, S, T, Y -> A in position 2. This tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n We can choose ""HASTY"". But we haven\'t tried H, S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""BASIC"" -> but C is forbidden (we know C is not in the word). So no.\n\n How about ""BAYOU""? -> B, A, Y, O, U -> A in position 2. This tests B, Y, O, U.\n\n But we don\'t know if B, Y, O, U are in the word.\n\n We are trying to cover more common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""ALOUD""? -> A, L, O, U, D -> A in position 1. This tests A (again) and L, O, U, D.\n\n But we are only testing 4 new letters (L, O, U, D) and we already know A is in the word.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible. So including A again is necessary because we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know the position. However, we are trying to find the position.\n\n We can try to put A in a position we haven\'t tried. In the first guess, A was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to find a word with A in position 1: \n   Words: ""ADIEU"" -> but E is forbidden and we have D, I, U. But E is not allowed.\n\n ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O -> avoids forbidden letters. This is a good candidate because it tests A (in position 1) and U, D, I, O.\n\n But note: we are not forced to test only new letters. We also want to get closer to the solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 2: \n   ""SALTY"": S, A, L, T, Y -> avoids forbidden letters. Tests S, L, T, Y.\n\n Or ""HALTS"": H, A, L, T, S -> tests H, L, T, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but English words have vowels.\n\n Since we have only one vowel so far (A) and we know it\'s in the word, but we don\'t know about others.\n\n We can try ""AUDIO"" to test A, U, D, I, O.\n\n But we can also try ""PASTY"" to test P, S, T, Y.\n\n I think ""PASTY"" is a good choice because it has common consonants and a new vowel? But it has Y which can be a vowel.\n\n Alternatively, ""SAUCY"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n We must avoid C.\n\n Another word: ""MOUTH"" -> no A.\n\n We need A.\n\n How about ""ABOUT""? -> A, B, O, U, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a good candidate because it tests 5 new letters (B, O, U, T) and we know A is in the word.\n\n But note: we are using A again, which is necessary.\n\n Alternatively, ""DAISY"" -> D, A, I, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests D, I, S, Y.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a common word and tests four new letters (D, I, S, Y) and A in a new position (2).\n\n But wait, we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""DAISY"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s consider ""DAISY"":\n\n   D: new\n   A: known to be in the word, but we are trying it in position 2 (which is new)\n   I: new\n   S: new\n   Y: new\n\n This tests 4 new letters and the known A.\n\n Alternatively, ""HASTY"" (A in position 2) tests H, S, T, Y.\n\n But ""DAISY"" is a flower, so it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""PAINT"" is invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""MAILS""? -> M, A, I, L, S -> A in position 2. This tests M, I, L, S.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has M, I, L, S.\n\n I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t know.\n\n We\'ll go with ""DAISY"".\n\n But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we won\'t get it in ""DAISY"". But we are trying to get information about A\'s position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 1: ""ADIEU"" is invalid because of E. \n\n ""ADMIT"": A, D, M, I, T -> A in position 1. This tests A (position 1), D, M, I, T.\n\n This is also good because we are testing A in a new position (1) and we get information about D, M, I, T.\n\n We have two good candidates: ""DAISY"" (A in position 2) and ""ADMIT"" (A in position 1).\n\n Which one to choose? \n\n We know that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but not there. So it could be in 1,2,4,5.\n\n By putting A in position 1 (as in ""ADMIT"") we are testing a new position. If we get a ✓ for A, then we know it\'s in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1 (so it must be in 2,4,5). If we get an \'x\', that would be a contradiction because we know A is in the word. But we shouldn\'t get an \'x\' for A.\n\n So, let\'s choose ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in position 1 and we get to test D, M, I, T.\n\n But note: we are also testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we lock in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n After considering, I think ""ADMIT"" is a good choice.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure we don\'t use forbidden letters: C, R, N, E. ""ADMIT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ADMIT"".\n\n However, note that we are using A again. But that\'s okay because we are trying to find the position of A.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SALAD"" has two A\'s and we are repeating A. We want to avoid repetition to test more letters.\n\n So, I choose ""ADMIT"".\n\n But let me check: ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1, D in 2, M in 3, I in 4, T in 5.\n\n We know that the secret word has an A, but we don\'t know if it has D, M, I, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" but it has two A\'s? Actually, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5. We are repeating A. We want to test more letters.\n\n So, I think ""ADMIT"" is better.\n\n Let me see: ""ADMIT"" uses A, D, M, I, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing D, M, I, T.\n\n We can also consider ""DAISY"" which tests D, A, I, S, Y. But in ""DAISY"", A is in position 2.\n\n Both are valid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ADMIT"" because it tests A in the first position and we get to see if A is in position 1.\n\n So, the next guess: ""ADMIT""\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has D, M, I, T. We are testing them.\n\n We are hoping to get feedback that might reveal more.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a position that we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters. \n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? -> S, T, A, M, P -> A in position 3? No, that\'s the same as before. We cannot put A in position 3.\n\n So, we must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n ""STAMP"" has A in position 3? \n   S (1), T (2), A (3), M (4), P (5) -> yes, position 3. So we cannot use that.\n\n How about ""SPAM""? -> only 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n ""SPAMS"": S, P, A, M, S -> but two S\'s? and A in position 3? Again, position 3 for A is not allowed.\n\n We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So, let\'s stick with ""ADMIT"".\n\n Alternatively, ""ABOUT"": A in position 1, and then B, O, U, T. This is also good.\n\n But ""ABOUT"" has A in position 1 and tests B, O, U, T.\n\n We can choose either.\n\n I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has O and U (vowels) and B, T (consonants).\n\n So, let\'s go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n But note: we are testing A in position 1. If we get a ✓, we know A is in position 1. If we get a \'-\', then we know A is not in position 1 and must be in 2,4,5.\n\n Also, we test B, O, U, T.\n\n This is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, ""ADMIT"" tests A in position 1 and D, M, I, T.\n\n Both are valid. I\'ll choose ""ABOUT"" because it has more vowels? \n\n But we already know the word has at least one vowel (A). We don\'t know about others.\n\n I think both are fine. Let me pick ""ABOUT"".\n\n However, note that we are not using the letter S, which is very common. But we can use that in the next guess if needed.\n\n We have to make a choice.\n\n I\'ll go with ""ABOUT"".\n\n So, the next guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n But wait, what if the word has A in position 1? Then we get a ✓ and we know the first letter. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A is in position 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test B, O, U, T.\n\n Let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.\n- Avoid **C, R, N, E** entirely.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **B, O, U, T**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""about""** fits these criteria:\n- **A** is placed in **position 1** (a new position to test).\n- Tests **B, O, U, T** (all new letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, N, E) and position 3 for A.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of A and reveal if any of B, O, U, T are in the secret word.\n\n<guess>about</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.\n  B: x (not in word)\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, what we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter A, but it is not in position 1, 3 (from the two guesses). Therefore, it must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n\nWe need to choose a new word that:\n- Includes A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).\n- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T.\n- Uses new common letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, L, I, D, H, M, P, Y, G, F, etc.\n\nWe also note that the word must have 5 letters and we know one of them (A) is in position 2,4, or 5.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in position 2:\n- Example: ""PASTA"" but we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""PASTA"" has P, A, S, T, A -> but T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word) and also we have two A\'s? But T is not allowed, so we cannot use ""PASTA"".\n\nWe must avoid T.\n\nHow about ""PASTY""? \n  P, A, S, T, Y -> but T is forbidden, so no.\n\nWe need to avoid T.\n\nHow about ""PASTY"" without T? Not possible because it\'s the same word.\n\nWe need a word without T and without the other forbidden letters.\n\nHow about ""PASSE""? But E is forbidden and it has two S\'s? Also, we don\'t know about S, but E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nAnother idea: ""PALLY""? But two L\'s and we don\'t know about L. Also, A is in position 2? But we have two L\'s and we don\'t know if L is in the word. Also, the word is 5 letters? ""PALLY"" is 5 letters: P, A, L, L, Y -> but two L\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two L\'s. Also, we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nHow about ""PALSY""? \n  P, A, L, S, Y -> A in position 2. This tests P, L, S, Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L, S, Y are in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY""? \n  D, A, I, L, Y -> A in position 2. Tests D, I, L, Y.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""DAILY"" does not contain any of the forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" is a candidate.\n\nWe can also consider A in position 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 4: ""FOCAL"" -> but C is forbidden and O is forbidden.\n\nAvoiding forbidden letters: F, O, C, L -> but O and C are forbidden, so no.\n\nPosition 5: ""MANGA"" -> M, A, N, G, A -> but N is forbidden, so no.\n\nAnother position 5: ""PIZZA"" -> P, I, Z, Z, A -> but Z is not very common and we have two Z\'s. Also, we are testing P, I, Z, and A. But we don\'t know about Z.\n\nWe want to test common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""SALAD"" -> but two A\'s and we have S, A, L, A, D -> but we know A is in the word, so we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""DAILY"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: \n  D: new\n  A: known, in position 2 (which is new)\n  I: new\n  L: new\n  Y: new\n\nThis tests 4 new letters and the known A.\n\nWe can also consider ""HAIKU"": H, A, I, K, U -> but U is forbidden (from guess2: U is not in the word). So no.\n\nAnother: ""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A\'s and avoids forbidden? M, A, F, I, A -> forbidden letters? We have A, M, F, I. But we are repeating A. And U is not in it, but we don\'t have U. However, we have A twice. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. So it\'s acceptable, but we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. So avoiding repetition is better.\n\nTherefore, ""DAILY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe also test D, I, L, Y.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""DAILY"".\n\nBut wait, what if the word has A in position 4? Then in ""DAILY"", A would be in position 2? Actually, in ""DAILY"", A is in position 2. But we are trying to test position 2.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4. For example: ""LYCRA"" -> but C and R are forbidden.\n\nAnother: ""SYNOD"" -> but N and O are forbidden.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with A in position 4 without using forbidden letters.\n\nHow about position 5? \n  ""PIZZA"": P, I, Z, Z, A -> but two Z\'s and we are testing P, I, Z. And A in position 5.\n\nBut Z is not very common.\n\nAnother: ""JUMBA"" -> J, U, M, B, A -> but U and B are forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""KARMA"": K, A, R, M, A -> but R is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""LABIA"": L, A, B, I, A -> but B is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""MAFIA"": M, A, F, I, A -> two A\'s and no forbidden letters? M, A, F, I, A. Forbidden letters are C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T. So M, F, I are allowed. But we are repeating A.\n\nWe can try ""MAFIA"", but we are using two A\'s. We know A is in the word, so if we get a ✓ for the last A, then we know the word has two A\'s. If we get a \'-\' for the last A, then we know A is in the word but not in position 5. If we get an \'x\' for the last A? But we know A is in the word, so it cannot be \'x\'. So we will get either ✓ or \'-\'.\n\nBut we are using two slots for A instead of testing new letters. So we get less information.\n\nTherefore, I think ""DAILY"" is a better choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALTY"": but S, A, L, T, Y -> T is forbidden (from guess2: T is not in the word). So no.\n\n""HASTY"": H, A, S, T, Y -> T is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""PALLY"": P, A, L, L, Y -> two L\'s and we are testing P, A, L, Y. But we are repeating L.\n\nWe can try ""PALLY"", but it has two L\'s. We don\'t know if the word has two L\'s.\n\nBut we want to test new letters. So avoiding repetition is better.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""DAILY"".\n\nSo, the next guess is ""DAILY"".\n\nBut note: we are putting A in position 2. If the word has A in position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nWe also test D, I, L, Y.\n\nThis will give us information about these letters.\n\nSo, let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A** is in the secret word but **not in position 1 or 3** (from Guess 1 and 2). Therefore, it must be in **position 2, 4, or 5**.\n- **C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T** are **not** in the word (all marked ""x"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- Avoid all forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T).\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **D, I, L, S, Y**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""daily""** fits perfectly:\n- **A** is placed in **position 2** (a new position to test).\n- Tests **D, I, L, Y** (all new letters, none forbidden).\n- Avoids position 3 for A and all excluded letters.\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).\n- Reveal if D, I, L, or Y are in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>daily</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)\n  N: x (not in word)\n  E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""about""\n  A: - (in word, but not in position 1) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 or 3.\n  B: x (not in word)\n  O: x (not in word)\n  U: x (not in word)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: ""daily""\n  D: x (not in word)\n  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n  I: - (in word, but not in position 3)\n  L: - (in word, but not in position 4)\n  Y: x (not in word)\n\nSo, what we know now:\n\n1. The secret word has A in position 2. (From the ✓ in ""daily"")\n2. The secret word contains I and L, but not in position 3 and 4 respectively. (From the \'-\' in ""daily"")\n   - I is in the word but not in position 3.\n   - L is in the word but not in position 4.\n3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.\n4. Additionally, we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3 (which we already know because now we have A in position 2) and from guess 2 that A is not in position 1 (which we know because A is in position 2).\n\nNow, let\'s list the knowns:\n\n- Position 2 is A.\n- The word contains I and L, but not in positions 3 and 4.\n- The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, I, L, Y.\n\nWe need to find a word that:\n- Has A in position 2.\n- Contains I and L (since they are in the word, but we don\'t know their positions yet).\n- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.\n\nAlso, we know that I is not in position 3 and L is not in position 4.\n\nSo, the word pattern so far: _ A _ _ _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters that are not forbidden and that include I and L.\n\nThe word must have I and L, and we have two positions to fill: positions 1, 3, 4, and 5? Actually, position 2 is fixed as A. So the word is: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWe know that I is in the word but not in position 3, so I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, L is in the word but not in position 4, so L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word must have exactly the letters we know so far? Not necessarily, because we don\'t know about the other letters. We have two more letters to find? Actually, we know the word has A (in pos2), I, L, and two more letters.\n\nWe have two more letters to discover because the word is 5 letters.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain the forbidden letters.\n\nSo, we need to choose a word that has:\n- Position 2: A\n- Contains I and L (each at least once, but possibly more? We don\'t know about duplicates)\n- And two other letters that are not in the forbidden list.\n\nForbidden letters: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y.\n\nAvailable letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z, and possibly others.\n\nWe also have to consider the positions for I and L.\n\nI cannot be in position 3 (from ""daily"") and L cannot be in position 4.\n\nSo, for I: possible positions: 1, 4, 5.\nFor L: possible positions: 1, 3, 5.\n\nBut note: if we put I in position 1, then L can be in 3 or 5. If we put I in position 4, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 5. Similarly, if I is in position 5, then L can be in 1 or 3 or 4? But L cannot be in 4? Wait, from ""daily"", L was in position 4 and got a \'-\', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. So L can be in 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A in the second position and contain I and L.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but we have to check the positions.\n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: I -> but we know I cannot be in position 3? From ""daily"", I was in position 3 and got a \'-\', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3. Therefore, ""MAILS"" is invalid because it puts I in position 3.\n\n- ""LAMPS"": L, A, M, P, S -> but then I is missing? We need to include I. So no.\n\n- ""IALs"": I, A, L, S -> but that\'s only 4 letters? We need 5. ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n- ""LAPIS"": L, A, P, I, S -> positions: \n  1: L\n  2: A\n  3: P\n  4: I\n  5: S\n  This avoids the forbidden letters? \n  L: allowed, A: fixed, P: allowed, I: allowed, S: allowed.\n  But we have to check the positions: \n  I is in position 4, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not in 3). \n  L is in position 1, which is allowed (since we know it\'s not in 4, and here it\'s in 1).\n\n  So ""LAPIS"" is a candidate.\n\n- ""SALAD"": but we have two A\'s? And D is forbidden. Also, we have A in position 2 and then A again? But D is forbidden.\n\n- ""PALIS"": P, A, L, I, S -> positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A\n  3: L\n  4: I\n  5: S\n  This seems good. \n  L is in position 3: which is allowed (since L can be in 1,3,5 and we haven\'t tried position 3 for L). \n  I is in position 4: which is allowed (since I can be in 1,4,5 and we haven\'t tried 4 for I).\n\n  But note: we have to avoid forbidden letters: P, A, L, I, S -> none of these are forbidden (C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y are forbidden). So ""PALIS"" is a candidate.\n\n- ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> similar to ""PALIS"", but with M.\n\n  But ""MALIS"" is a word? Yes, meaning mistakes or errors.\n\n- ""FALIS"": not a common word.\n\n- ""GALIS"": not common.\n\n- ""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> positions: \n  1: H\n  2: A\n  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.\n\n- ""WAILS"": same issue.\n\n- ""RAILS"": but R is forbidden.\n\n- ""TAILS"": T is forbidden.\n\n- ""DAISY"": but D and Y are forbidden.\n\n- ""PAIS"": only 4 letters.\n\nSo, let\'s consider ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". But we also have to think of words with A in position 2 and I and L.\n\nAnother word: ""LAICS"": L, A, I, C, S -> but C is forbidden.\n\n""LAUFS"": but U and F? U is forbidden.\n\n""LAIRS"": R forbidden.\n\n""LAMIN"": but N is forbidden.\n\n""LAPSE"": E and S? E is forbidden.\n\n""LARIS"": R forbidden.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are candidates.\n\nBut note: in ""PALIS"", we have:\n  P (position 1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)\n\nWe know that L is not in position 4 (from ""daily"") but we are putting L in position 3, which is allowed. And I is in position 4, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for ""MALIS"": M (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5)\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has P, M, S, etc.\n\nWe can also consider words that put I and L in different positions.\n\nFor example, put I in position 1 and L in position 5? \n  ""IALS"" is 4 letters.\n\n""ILium"": but U is forbidden and it\'s not common.\n\n""ILACI"": but C and I in position 1? But C is forbidden.\n\n""VALID"": but V, A, L, I, D -> D is forbidden.\n\n""VALID"" has D, which is forbidden.\n\n""GAVIL"": not a word.\n\n""JAIL"": 4 letters.\n\n""MAIL"": 4 letters.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SALAD"" is invalid because of D and two A\'s.\n\n""PALMY"": but Y is forbidden.\n\n""PALMS"": P, A, L, M, S -> positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A\n  3: L\n  4: M\n  5: S\n  This word: \n  - P: new\n  - A: fixed\n  - L: in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5)\n  - M: new\n  - S: new\n  And it includes I? No, it doesn\'t have I. But we know the word must have I. So this is invalid.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nSo, we need a word that has I and L, with A in position 2.\n\nWe have ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"". Also, ""PALIS"" is a word (plural of palis, meaning palis or picket fences).\n\nAnother word: ""HAILS"" is invalid because of I in position 3.\n\n""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> positions: \n  1: M\n  2: A\n  3: I -> but I cannot be in position 3! So invalid.\n\n""TAILS"": T forbidden.\n\n""FAILS"": F, A, I, L, S -> positions: \n  1: F\n  2: A\n  3: I -> again, I in position 3 is not allowed.\n\nSo, we must avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our guess, we must not put I in position 3 and not put L in position 4.\n\nSo, for ""PALIS"": \n  Position 1: P\n  Position 2: A (fixed)\n  Position 3: L -> allowed? Yes, because L can be in 3.\n  Position 4: I -> allowed? Yes, because I can be in 4.\n  Position 5: S\n\nThis is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""MALIS"":\n  Position 1: M\n  Position 2: A\n  Position 3: L\n  Position 4: I\n  Position 5: S\n\nBoth ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has P, M, S, or the other letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SALIS"": but S, A, L, I, S -> two S\'s? And A in position 2. But then I is in position 4? \n  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but two S\'s? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, we are repeating S. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" and ""MALIS"" are better because they have all distinct letters except A, L, I, S? Actually, ""PALIS"" has P, A, L, I, S -> all distinct? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""MALIS"": M, A, L, I, S -> distinct.\n\nBut note: we have already used S in ""crane"" and ""about""? No, we haven\'t. ""crane"" had C,R,A,N,E; ""about"" had A,B,O,U,T; ""daily"" had D,A,I,L,Y. So S is new.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we know I is in the word but not in position 3, and L is in the word but not in position 4. In ""PALIS"", we have L in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable.\n\nIn ""MALIS"", same positions.\n\nBut what if the word has I in position 1? Then we haven\'t tested that.\n\nWe can try to put I in position 1.\n\nFor example, ""IALS"" is 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n""ILAC"": 4 letters.\n\n""ILIAD"": but D is forbidden.\n\n""ILIAD"": has D? Yes, D is forbidden.\n\n""VALID"": has D, forbidden.\n\n""JAIL"": 4 letters.\n\n""MAILS"": M, A, I, L, S -> but I is in position 3? \n  M (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5) -> but I in position 3 is not allowed (from ""daily"", I cannot be in 3). And also, L is in position 4? But we know L cannot be in position 4 (from ""daily""). So both positions are forbidden for these letters? \n\nWait, no: for I, we cannot put it in position 3. For L, we cannot put it in position 4.\n\nIn ""MAILS"", if we put I in position 3, that is not allowed because we know I is not in position 3. And L in position 4 is not allowed. So ""MAILS"" is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""AILIS"" (if valid) is not common.\n\nAnother word: ""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.\n\n""LARVA"": R and V? R is forbidden.\n\n""LATKE"": T and K? T is forbidden.\n\nSo, it\'s hard to put I in position 1.\n\nWhat about putting I in position 4 or 5?\n\nWe have ""PALIS"" (I in 4) and ""MALis"" (I in 4) and also ""PALIS"" has L in position 3 and I in 4.\n\nBut we can also consider putting L in position 1 and I in position 5? \n  ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.\n\n""LARIS"": R forbidden.\n\n""LAMAS"": M, A, S -> but then we need I? We must have I. ""LAMAS"" has A in position 2? \n  L (1), A (2), M (3), A (4), S (5) -> but we have two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.\n\nBut we know A is in the word, so we are using one slot for A. We have two more letters to test.\n\nIn ""LAMAS"", we have A in position 2 and 4? So we are testing L, A, M, S, and A again. Not ideal.\n\nSo, back to ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"".\n\nWe can also consider ""SALIS"": S, A, L, I, S -> but two S\'s? And A in position 2. \n  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. Also, we are testing S multiple times. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" and ""MALis"" are better.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""GAILS"": G, A, I, L, S -> positions: \n  G (1), A (2), I (3), L (4), S (5)\n  But I is in position 3: not allowed! Because we know I is not in position 3.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""HAILS"": H, A, I, L, S -> I in position 3: invalid.\n\nSo, we must avoid position 3 for I.\n\nTherefore, the only options are words like ""PALIS"" (where I is in 4) or ""MALis"" (same).\n\nAnother word: ""PALIK"" -> not common and K is new, but we don\'t have I in position 3? \n  P, A, L, I, K -> positions: \n    1: P\n    2: A\n    3: L -> but L can be in 3? Yes, because we only know it\'s not in 4. \n    4: I\n    5: K\n  This is valid? But is ""PALIK"" a word? I don\'t think it\'s common. Let me check: I think ""palik"" is not standard. \n\n""PALIS"" is a valid word (plural of palis).\n\nSimilarly, ""MALis"" is valid (plural of malis, meaning mistakes? But also an adjective in some contexts?).\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""SALIS"" -> but S, A, L, I, S -> two S\'s. And A in position 2. \n  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> I is in 4, L in 3 (which is allowed). But we are repeating S.\n\nWe can try ""PALIS"" or ""MALis"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""PALIS"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  P: new\n  A: fixed\n  L: in position 3 (allowed, since we only know L is not in 4)\n  I: in position 4 (allowed, since we know I is not in 3)\n  S: new\n\nThis tests P, L, I, S and confirms A.\n\nBut we already know A is in position 2, so we are mainly testing the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? \n  For example, ""PALMS"": but M and S? And I is missing.\n\nWe need I.\n\n""PALIS"" has I in position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""LAPSE"": E forbidden.\n\n""LAMIN"" -> N forbidden.\n\nSo, I think ""PALIS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S\'s and I in position 4. But we are repeating S.\n\nWe can try ""PALIS"" to test P, L, I, S.\n\nBut we also have to consider that L is in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be in position 3. We haven\'t tried position 3 for L.\n\nSimilarly, I is in position 4.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not using any forbidden letters. We are not.\n\nSo, the next guess: ""PALIS""\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  P: not forbidden\n  A: in word, but we know position 2 is A, so we are using that.\n  L: in word, and we are putting it in position 3 (which is allowed).\n  I: in word, putting it in position 4 (allowed).\n  S: not forbidden.\n\nSo, it should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MAFIA"", but F and A? But ""MAFIA"" has A in position 2? \n  M (1), A (2), F (3), I (4), A (5) -> but two A\'s? And we are testing M, F, I, and A again. We know A is in position 2, so we are using that. But we are repeating A. We want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""GALAS"": G, A, L, A, S -> two A\'s? And we are testing G, L, S, and A again. Not ideal.\n\nSo, I think ""PALIS"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""PALIS"".\n\nSo, the guess is ""PALIS"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S\'s and A in position 2. \n  S (1), A (2), L (3), I (4), S (5) -> but we are repeating S. And we don\'t know if S is in the word. We are testing S in two positions? But we are only testing one new letter (S) because the other S is repeated.\n\nWhereas in ""PALIS"", we have all distinct letters: P, A, L, I, S. So we test P, L, I, S, and A.\n\nWe know A is in position 2, so we are testing P, L, I, S.\n\nThis is better.\n\nSimilarly, ""MALis"" is also distinct.\n\nBut ""PALIS"" is more common? \n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me pick ""PALIS"".\n\nSo, the next guess is ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we have to output in the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 5? \n  For example, ""PANIC"" -> but N and C are forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""PAPAL"": P, A, P, A, L -> but A in position 2 and 4? And L in position 5. But we are repeating P and A. And we don\'t have I? We must include I.\n\nWe must have I.\n\nSo, I think ""PALIS"" is the best.\n\nBut let me think of ""PAWIS"": P, A, W, I, S -> positions: \n  1: P\n  2: A\n  3: W\n  4: I\n  5: S\n  This is valid? ""PAWIS"" is a word? I think not. \n\n""PAWIS"" is not standard.\n\n""PALIS"" is the plural of palis, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1? We haven\'t tried that.\n\nBut we can try in the next guess if needed.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can test.\n\nBut we are making progress.\n\nAnother word: ""MANIS"": M, A, N, I, S -> but N is forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" it is.\n\nBut wait, what about ""SALIS""? It has two S\'s. We are testing S, but we are repeating S. So we test S only once (in position 1 or 5) and then the other S is known to be in the word? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate S.\n\nWe want to test new letters.\n\nSo, ""PALIS"" is better.\n\nWe can also consider ""HAIL"": 4 letters.\n\nSo, I think we should guess ""PALIS"".\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback we have: \n  We know A is in position 2.\n  We know I is in the word but not in position 3.\n  We know L is in the word but not in position 4.\n  We know the word has I and L.\n\nSo, with ""PALIS"", we are testing:\n  Position 1: P\n  Position 3: L -> we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it can be in position 3.\n  Position 4: I -> testing if I is in position 4.\n  Position 5: S\n\nWe also test P.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for P, then P is in the word and in position 1.\n\nIf we get a \'-\' for P, then P is in the word but not in position 1.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nThis will give us more information.\n\nSo, I choose ""PALIS"".\n\nBut note: we are putting L in position 3. We know L is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be in position 3. We haven\'t tried position 3 for L.\n\nSimilarly, we are putting I in position 4, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nSo, let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>palis</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓).\n- **I** and **L** are in the word but **not in position 3** (from ""daily"" -) and **not in position 4** (from ""daily"" -), respectively.\n- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).\n- **Known letters**: A (pos2), I, L are present, with I not in pos3 and L not in pos4.\n\nThe word pattern is: _ A _ _ _\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must have **A in position 2**.\n- Must include **I and L** (since they are confirmed present).\n- I cannot be in position 3, and L cannot be in position 4.\n- Avoid all forbidden letters.\n\n**""palis""** is a valid guess:\n- **P** (new) in position 1.\n- **A** (confirmed) in position 2.\n- **L** in position 3 (allowed, since L can be in 1,3,5).\n- **I** in position 4 (allowed, since I can be in 1,4,5 and not in 3).\n- **S** (new) in position 5.\n\nThis tests new letters (P, S) and checks positions for I and L.\n\n<guess>palis</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: daily -> FEEDBACK: D(x) A(✓) I(-) L(-) Y(x)\nGuess 4: palis -> FEEDBACK: P(-) A(✓) L(-) I(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>

3. Absent letters: 
   From all feedback: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y, and also from ""palis"": P is present but not in position 1, and L is present but not in position 3. But we already knew L was not in position 4.

4. So the secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: I
   - Position 5: S
   - The letter P is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - The letter L is in the word, but not in position 3 or 4. Since position 4 is I and position 5 is S, L must be in position 1 or 3? But wait, position 3 is the only one left? Let's see:

   The word is: [1] A [3] [4] [5]
   We know: 
     Position 4: I
     Position 5: S
   So positions 1, 3, and 4 are open? But position 4 is taken by I, so position 1 and 3 are free.

   But L cannot be in position 3? From ""palis"": L was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. So L cannot be in position 3.

   Therefore, L must be in position 1.

   Because the only positions left are 1, 3, and we know L is not in 3 or 4? Position 4 is I and S, so L can only be in position 1.

   So position 1 must be L? But we haven't confirmed L in position 1 yet.

   We know L is in the word and it must be in position 1 or 3? But we know it's not in 3, so it must be in position 1.

   Therefore, position 1 is L.

   So the word is: L A [3] I S

   Now, we have position 3 missing.

5. Also, we know P is in the word, but not in position 1 (which we just deduced is L). So P must be in position 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are I and S, so position 3 is the only one left? 

   The word: L A [3] I S
   P is in the word, but not in position 1 (which is L), and not in position 4 or 5 (which are I and S). So the only position left for P is position 3.

   Therefore, position 3 must be P.

   So the word is: L A P I S

   But wait, we have feedback from ""palis"": 
     In ""palis"", we had P in position 1 (which got a '-', meaning P is in the word but not in position 1) and L in position 3 (which got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 3). 
     But in our new word, we are putting L in position 1 and P in position 3? 

   Let's check: 
     Position 1: L (we are putting L there, which we haven't tried before)
     Position 3: P (we are putting P there, which we haven't tried)

   But in the feedback for ""palis"", we know that P is in the word (but not in position 1) and L is in the word (but not in position 3). 
   In our new word, we are putting L in position 1 (which is new) and P in position 3 (which is new). 

   This is consistent.

   So the word should be: L A P I S

   But we haven't guessed it yet. We need to confirm.

   However, we are to make a new guess. We can guess the whole word.

   But let's see if there are other possibilities.

   We know position 3 must be P? Because we have to fill position 3 and we know P is in the word and must go there because:
     - Position 1: we cannot put P (because of ""palis"" feedback: P not in position 1)
     - Position 3: we cannot put L (because of ""palis"": L not in position 3)
     - Position 4 and 5 are fixed.

   So P must be in position 3.

   Therefore, the word is L A P I S.

   But wait, we haven't tested position 1 for L? But we are putting L there.

   And we haven't tested position 3 for P? But we are putting P there.

   So we can guess ""LAPIS"".

   But let's make sure about the letters: 
     L: we are putting L in position 1. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tried position 1 for L.
     P: we are putting P in position 3. We know P is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for P.
     A: position 2 (confirmed)
     I: position 4 (confirmed)
     S: position 5 (confirmed)

   And we avoid all forbidden letters.

   So the guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words. However, we have deduced that L must be in position 1 and P in position 3.

   Alternatively, could P be in position 1? But we know from ""palis"" that P is not in position 1 (because it got a '-'). So no.

   Could L be in position 3? But in ""palis"", we put L in position 3 and got a '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So position 3 must be P.

   Therefore, the word is L A P I S.

   So we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we have to output the guess.

   However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   Also, we haven't used any duplicate letters in our guesses.

   So, let's go with ""LAPIS"".

   But wait, what about position 3? We are putting P there. We know P is in the word, and we are testing it in position 3.

   If we guess ""LAPIS"", we are testing:
      L in position 1: we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 1.
      P in position 3: we know P is in the word, testing if it's in position 3.
      A in position 2: already confirmed.
      I in position 4: confirmed.
      S in position 5: confirmed.

   This should be the secret word.

   But we are to make a new guess, so we can guess ""LAPIS"".

   However, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

   Another possibility: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, could there be two P's? 
     We know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. 
     In ""palis"", we had P in position 1 and got a '-', meaning at least one P is present but not in position 1. 
     If we put P in position 3, that might be the same P or a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

   Similarly, for L: we have L in position 1. We know L is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the word has two L's, then we might get more feedback, but we don't have reason to think that.

   So, we assume the word is ""LAPIS"".

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess, and we have 6 tries. We are on the fifth guess.

   So, let's output ""LAPIS"".

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""LAPIS"" but with a duplicate? 
     We don't have any duplicate in our guess ""palis"", so we don't know.

   But in ""palis"", we had only one P and one L. The feedback for P was '-' meaning at least one P is present but not in position 1. That is consistent with ""LAPIS"" having one P (in position 3).

   Similarly, for L: in ""palis"", we had L in position 3 (got '-') and in ""LAPIS"" we have L in position 1. So if the word is ""LAPIS"", then in ""palis"" we had L in position 3 (which is wrong) and P in position 1 (which is also wrong, and we now know P is in position 3).

   So it fits.

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But wait, what about the letter in position 3? In ""palis"", we had L in position 3 and got a '-', meaning the letter in position 3 is not L. Then in ""LAPIS"", we put P in position 3, which is not L, so that's consistent.

   Also, in ""LAPIS"", we have:
        L: position 1 -> we haven't tried L in position 1 before? We tried L in position 4 (in ""daily"") and position 3 (in ""palis"", but that was a '-' meaning not in 3). Now we are trying L in position 1.

   Similarly, P: we tried P in position 1 (in ""palis"") and got a '-', meaning P is in the word but not in position 1. Now we are trying P in position 3.

   This matches.

   So, we are confident.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess, and we are on the fifth guess. We can solve it now.

   However, the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", so we output the guess.

   But let me double-check the forbidden letters: 
      LAPIS: L, A, P, I, S -> no C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y. Correct.

   And the pattern: 
      Position 1: L -> we haven't tried L in position 1. We know L is in the word, so if it's in position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know L must be in position 3? But wait, we know L is not in position 3 (from ""palis"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily""). And position 2 is A and 5 is S, so the only position left for L is position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 1.

   Similarly, P: we are putting it in position 3. We know P is in the word, and we haven't tried it in position 3. So if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then P must be in position 1? But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). So that's a contradiction? 

   Wait, no: if we put P in position 3 and it's not there, then where else can P be? The only positions available are 1 and 3? But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). So if we get a '-' for P, that would mean P is in the word but not in position 3? But then where? 
     Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
     Position 2: A (fixed), position 4: I (fixed), position 5: S (fixed). 
     So the only position for P is position 1. But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). Therefore, P must be in position 3? But we are putting P in position 3. 

   This is a logical contradiction because we know P is in the word and the only position left is position 3? 

   Wait, let me clarify:

   The secret word: [1] A [3] [4] [5] = [1] A I S (since I and S are fixed in 4 and 5).

   We know P is in the word. The only positions available are 1 and 3. 
   - If we put P in position 1, that would be a conflict because we know from ""palis"" that P is not in position 1 (because we had P in position 1 and got a '-').
   - If we put P in position 3, then that is a new position. We haven't tried P in position 3. So it's possible.

   Therefore, the only possibility is that P is in position 3.

   So the word must be: L A P I S.

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure because we haven't guessed L in position 1 before. But logically, it must be.

   So, we output ""LAPIS"".

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""LAPIS"" but with a duplicate? 
     We don't have any duplicate in our previous guesses. But if there is a duplicate, it might affect the feedback. 
     In ""palis"", we had one P and one L. The feedback for P was '-' meaning at least one P is present. If the word has two P's, then when we put P in position 1 (in ""palis"") we got a '-' meaning that the P is present but not in position 1. Then when we put P in position 3 (in ""LAPIS"") we will get a ✓ if there is only one P, or a '-' if there is a duplicate P elsewhere? But we don't have any duplicate in ""LAPIS"".

   In ""LAPIS"", we have one P and one L.

   But what if the word has two L's? 
     In ""daily"", we had L in position 4 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. 
     In ""LAPIS"", we are putting L in position 1 (which is new) and P in position 3. 
     If the word has two L's, then we are putting one L in position 1 (which might be correct) and the other L might be in position 3? But we are putting P in position 3. So if the word has L in position 3, then we are putting P there? That would be a conflict.

   Therefore, the only possibility is that L is in position 1 and P is in position 3.

   So, we are confident.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess. We are on the fifth guess.

   So, we output ""LAPIS"".

   However, let me check if ""LAPIS"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a type of stone).

   So, the guess is ""LAPIS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓ and ""about"" -).
- **I** is confirmed in **position 4** (from ""palis"" ✓).
- **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (from ""palis"" ✓).
- **L** is in the word but **not in position 3 or 4** (from ""daily"" - and ""palis"" -).
- **P** is in the word but **not in position 1** (from ""palis"" -).

The secret word pattern is: **L A [?] I S**

We know:
- Position 1: **L** (deduced because L must be in position 1, as it cannot be in 3 or 4, and positions 2,4,5 are fixed).
- Position 2: **A** (fixed).
- Position 3: **P** (deduced because P must be in position 3: it cannot be in 1, and positions 4/5 are fixed; position 3 is the only remaining slot).
- Position 4: **I** (fixed).
- Position 5: **S** (fixed).

Thus, the secret word must be **L A P I S** (a type of stone).

This guess confirms the only possible word that fits all constraints.

<guess>lapis</guess>",lapis,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""about""
  A: - (in word, but not in position 1)
  B: x (not in word)
  O: x (not in word)
  U: x (not in word)
  T: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""daily""
  D: x (not in word)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  I: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  L: - (in word, but not in position 4)
  Y: x (not in word)

Guess 4: ""palis""
  P: - (in word, but not in position 1)
  A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
  L: - (in word, but not in position 3)
  I: ✓ (correct, in position 4)
  S: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Now, let's consolidate the information:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: I
   - Position 5: S

2. Known present letters (but not yet positioned):
   - P: in word, but not in position 1 (from ""palis"" feedback: P(-))
   - L: in word, but not in position 3 or 4 (from ""daily"" and ""palis"")
   - A: already placed and confirmed.

3. Absent letters: 
   From all feedback: C, R, N, E, B, O, U, T, D, Y, and also from ""palis"": P is present but not in position 1, and L is present but not in position 3. But we already knew L was not in position 4.

4. So the secret word has:
   - Position 2: A
   - Position 4: I
   - Position 5: S
   - The letter P is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - The letter L is in the word, but not in position 3 or 4. Since position 4 is I and position 5 is S, L must be in position 1 or 3? But wait, position 3 is the only one left? Let's see:

   The word is: [1] A [3] [4] [5]
   We know: 
     Position 4: I
     Position 5: S
   So positions 1, 3, and 4 are open? But position 4 is taken by I, so position 1 and 3 are free.

   But L cannot be in position 3? From ""palis"": L was in position 3 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 3. So L cannot be in position 3.

   Therefore, L must be in position 1.

   Because the only positions left are 1, 3, and we know L is not in 3 or 4? Position 4 is I and S, so L can only be in position 1.

   So position 1 must be L? But we haven't confirmed L in position 1 yet.

   We know L is in the word and it must be in position 1 or 3? But we know it's not in 3, so it must be in position 1.

   Therefore, position 1 is L.

   So the word is: L A [3] I S

   Now, we have position 3 missing.

5. Also, we know P is in the word, but not in position 1 (which we just deduced is L). So P must be in position 3? Because positions 4 and 5 are I and S, so position 3 is the only one left? 

   The word: L A [3] I S
   P is in the word, but not in position 1 (which is L), and not in position 4 or 5 (which are I and S). So the only position left for P is position 3.

   Therefore, position 3 must be P.

   So the word is: L A P I S

   But wait, we have feedback from ""palis"": 
     In ""palis"", we had P in position 1 (which got a '-', meaning P is in the word but not in position 1) and L in position 3 (which got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 3). 
     But in our new word, we are putting L in position 1 and P in position 3? 

   Let's check: 
     Position 1: L (we are putting L there, which we haven't tried before)
     Position 3: P (we are putting P there, which we haven't tried)

   But in the feedback for ""palis"", we know that P is in the word (but not in position 1) and L is in the word (but not in position 3). 
   In our new word, we are putting L in position 1 (which is new) and P in position 3 (which is new). 

   This is consistent.

   So the word should be: L A P I S

   But we haven't guessed it yet. We need to confirm.

   However, we are to make a new guess. We can guess the whole word.

   But let's see if there are other possibilities.

   We know position 3 must be P? Because we have to fill position 3 and we know P is in the word and must go there because:
     - Position 1: we cannot put P (because of ""palis"" feedback: P not in position 1)
     - Position 3: we cannot put L (because of ""palis"": L not in position 3)
     - Position 4 and 5 are fixed.

   So P must be in position 3.

   Therefore, the word is L A P I S.

   But wait, we haven't tested position 1 for L? But we are putting L there.

   And we haven't tested position 3 for P? But we are putting P there.

   So we can guess ""LAPIS"".

   But let's make sure about the letters: 
     L: we are putting L in position 1. We know L is in the word, and we haven't tried position 1 for L.
     P: we are putting P in position 3. We know P is in the word, and we haven't tried position 3 for P.
     A: position 2 (confirmed)
     I: position 4 (confirmed)
     S: position 5 (confirmed)

   And we avoid all forbidden letters.

   So the guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure because there might be other words. However, we have deduced that L must be in position 1 and P in position 3.

   Alternatively, could P be in position 1? But we know from ""palis"" that P is not in position 1 (because it got a '-'). So no.

   Could L be in position 3? But in ""palis"", we put L in position 3 and got a '-', meaning L is not in position 3. So position 3 must be P.

   Therefore, the word is L A P I S.

   So we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we have to output the guess.

   However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   Also, we haven't used any duplicate letters in our guesses.

   So, let's go with ""LAPIS"".

   But wait, what about position 3? We are putting P there. We know P is in the word, and we are testing it in position 3.

   If we guess ""LAPIS"", we are testing:
      L in position 1: we know L is in the word, but we are testing if it's in position 1.
      P in position 3: we know P is in the word, testing if it's in position 3.
      A in position 2: already confirmed.
      I in position 4: confirmed.
      S in position 5: confirmed.

   This should be the secret word.

   But we are to make a new guess, so we can guess ""LAPIS"".

   However, we have to make sure that we are not missing something.

   Another possibility: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, could there be two P's? 
     We know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. 
     In ""palis"", we had P in position 1 and got a '-', meaning at least one P is present but not in position 1. 
     If we put P in position 3, that might be the same P or a duplicate? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

   Similarly, for L: we have L in position 1. We know L is in the word, and we are putting it in position 1. If the word has two L's, then we might get more feedback, but we don't have reason to think that.

   So, we assume the word is ""LAPIS"".

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess, and we have 6 tries. We are on the fifth guess.

   So, let's output ""LAPIS"".

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""LAPIS"" but with a duplicate? 
     We don't have any duplicate in our guess ""palis"", so we don't know.

   But in ""palis"", we had only one P and one L. The feedback for P was '-' meaning at least one P is present but not in position 1. That is consistent with ""LAPIS"" having one P (in position 3).

   Similarly, for L: in ""palis"", we had L in position 3 (got '-') and in ""LAPIS"" we have L in position 1. So if the word is ""LAPIS"", then in ""palis"" we had L in position 3 (which is wrong) and P in position 1 (which is also wrong, and we now know P is in position 3).

   So it fits.

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But wait, what about the letter in position 3? In ""palis"", we had L in position 3 and got a '-', meaning the letter in position 3 is not L. Then in ""LAPIS"", we put P in position 3, which is not L, so that's consistent.

   Also, in ""LAPIS"", we have:
        L: position 1 -> we haven't tried L in position 1 before? We tried L in position 4 (in ""daily"") and position 3 (in ""palis"", but that was a '-' meaning not in 3). Now we are trying L in position 1.

   Similarly, P: we tried P in position 1 (in ""palis"") and got a '-', meaning P is in the word but not in position 1. Now we are trying P in position 3.

   This matches.

   So, we are confident.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess, and we are on the fifth guess. We can solve it now.

   However, the problem says ""Make a new 5-letter word guess"", so we output the guess.

   But let me double-check the forbidden letters: 
      LAPIS: L, A, P, I, S -> no C,R,N,E,B,O,U,T,D,Y. Correct.

   And the pattern: 
      Position 1: L -> we haven't tried L in position 1. We know L is in the word, so if it's in position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know L must be in position 3? But wait, we know L is not in position 3 (from ""palis"") and not in position 4 (from ""daily""). And position 2 is A and 5 is S, so the only position left for L is position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 1.

   Similarly, P: we are putting it in position 3. We know P is in the word, and we haven't tried it in position 3. So if it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then P must be in position 1? But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). So that's a contradiction? 

   Wait, no: if we put P in position 3 and it's not there, then where else can P be? The only positions available are 1 and 3? But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). So if we get a '-' for P, that would mean P is in the word but not in position 3? But then where? 
     Positions: 1,2,3,4,5. 
     Position 2: A (fixed), position 4: I (fixed), position 5: S (fixed). 
     So the only position for P is position 1. But we know P is not in position 1 (from ""palis""). Therefore, P must be in position 3? But we are putting P in position 3. 

   This is a logical contradiction because we know P is in the word and the only position left is position 3? 

   Wait, let me clarify:

   The secret word: [1] A [3] [4] [5] = [1] A I S (since I and S are fixed in 4 and 5).

   We know P is in the word. The only positions available are 1 and 3. 
   - If we put P in position 1, that would be a conflict because we know from ""palis"" that P is not in position 1 (because we had P in position 1 and got a '-').
   - If we put P in position 3, then that is a new position. We haven't tried P in position 3. So it's possible.

   Therefore, the only possibility is that P is in position 3.

   So the word must be: L A P I S.

   Therefore, we guess ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure because we haven't guessed L in position 1 before. But logically, it must be.

   So, we output ""LAPIS"".

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, what if the word is ""LAPIS"" but with a duplicate? 
     We don't have any duplicate in our previous guesses. But if there is a duplicate, it might affect the feedback. 
     In ""palis"", we had one P and one L. The feedback for P was '-' meaning at least one P is present. If the word has two P's, then when we put P in position 1 (in ""palis"") we got a '-' meaning that the P is present but not in position 1. Then when we put P in position 3 (in ""LAPIS"") we will get a ✓ if there is only one P, or a '-' if there is a duplicate P elsewhere? But we don't have any duplicate in ""LAPIS"".

   In ""LAPIS"", we have one P and one L.

   But what if the word has two L's? 
     In ""daily"", we had L in position 4 and got a '-', meaning L is in the word but not in position 4. 
     In ""LAPIS"", we are putting L in position 1 (which is new) and P in position 3. 
     If the word has two L's, then we are putting one L in position 1 (which might be correct) and the other L might be in position 3? But we are putting P in position 3. So if the word has L in position 3, then we are putting P there? That would be a conflict.

   Therefore, the only possibility is that L is in position 1 and P is in position 3.

   So, we are confident.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""LAPIS"".

   But note: we are to make a new guess. We are on the fifth guess.

   So, we output ""LAPIS"".

   However, let me check if ""LAPIS"" is a valid word. Yes, it is (a type of stone).

   So, the guess is ""LAPIS"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from ""daily"" ✓ and ""about"" -).
- **I** is confirmed in **position 4** (from ""palis"" ✓).
- **S** is confirmed in **position 5** (from ""palis"" ✓).
- **L** is in the word but **not in position 3 or 4** (from ""daily"" - and ""palis"" -).
- **P** is in the word but **not in position 1** (from ""palis"" -).

The secret word pattern is: **L A [?] I S**

We know:
- Position 1: **L** (deduced because L must be in position 1, as it cannot be in 3 or 4, and positions 2,4,5 are fixed).
- Position 2: **A** (fixed).
- Position 3: **P** (deduced because P must be in position 3: it cannot be in 1, and positions 4/5 are fixed; position 3 is the only remaining slot).
- Position 4: **I** (fixed).
- Position 5: **S** (fixed).

Thus, the secret word must be **L A P I S** (a type of stone).

This guess confirms the only possible word that fits all constraints.",Guess 5: lapis -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) P(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
