We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.
 We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).

 We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.

 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let's spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.

 However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don't know. We can try.

 But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it's not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we don't know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.

 Let me think of words starting with E: but we don't know if that's the case. We might want to test other positions.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.

 But we also want to test other common letters.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don't know if these are in the word.
 - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.
 - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn't have those. However, we don't know about H, O, T, L.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, let's avoid the end for E.

 How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: 
 - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let's try: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don't want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don't know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E's? But we don't have information about duplicates.

 To keep it simple, let's try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: 
   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don't know about B, O, W.

 However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn't have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.

 But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.

 Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

 So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.

 Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can try position 1: 
   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. 
     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don't know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that's 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.

 But we don't know if E is at 1. We are testing.

 However, we can also try E at position 2: 
   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That's still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.

 However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don't know about position 4.

 But we can try a word that has E in the middle.

 Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it's in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven't tried.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. And D is a common letter.

 But we don't know if D is in the word. We are testing.

 However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.

 How about E at position 2? 
   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.

   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.

   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.
   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.

 We don't know which position E is in. So either is fine.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. 
 ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 

 Both are good. I'll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.

 However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.

 I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.

 However, we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

 Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing P and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.

 Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it's less common.

 Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".

 I'll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.

 But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn't get an 'x'. We will get either ✓ or -.

 So let's choose ""TEPID"".

 But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.

 ""TEPID"" has I and no O? 

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. So that's acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.

 However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.

 How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.

 How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.

 So my second guess: ""SPIEL""

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.

 Also, we test S, P, I, L.

 So let's do ""SPIEL"".

<guess>spiel</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.

The word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.

<guess>spiel</guess>",spiel,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.
 We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).

 We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.

 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let's spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.

 However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don't know. We can try.

 But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it's not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we don't know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.

 Let me think of words starting with E: but we don't know if that's the case. We might want to test other positions.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.

 But we also want to test other common letters.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don't know if these are in the word.
 - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.
 - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn't have those. However, we don't know about H, O, T, L.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, let's avoid the end for E.

 How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: 
 - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let's try: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don't want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don't know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E's? But we don't have information about duplicates.

 To keep it simple, let's try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: 
   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don't know about B, O, W.

 However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn't have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.

 But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.

 Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

 So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.

 Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can try position 1: 
   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. 
     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don't know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that's 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.

 But we don't know if E is at 1. We are testing.

 However, we can also try E at position 2: 
   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That's still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.

 However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don't know about position 4.

 But we can try a word that has E in the middle.

 Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it's in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven't tried.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. And D is a common letter.

 But we don't know if D is in the word. We are testing.

 However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.

 How about E at position 2? 
   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.

   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.

   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.
   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.

 We don't know which position E is in. So either is fine.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. 
 ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 

 Both are good. I'll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.

 However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.

 I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.

 However, we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

 Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing P and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.

 Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it's less common.

 Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".

 I'll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.

 But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn't get an 'x'. We will get either ✓ or -.

 So let's choose ""TEPID"".

 But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.

 ""TEPID"" has I and no O? 

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. So that's acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.

 However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.

 How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.

 How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.

 So my second guess: ""SPIEL""

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.

 Also, we test S, P, I, L.

 So let's do ""SPIEL"".

<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.

The word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.",Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.
 We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).

 We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.

 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let's spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.

 However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don't know. We can try.

 But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it's not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we don't know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.

 Let me think of words starting with E: but we don't know if that's the case. We might want to test other positions.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.

 But we also want to test other common letters.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don't know if these are in the word.
 - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.
 - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn't have those. However, we don't know about H, O, T, L.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, let's avoid the end for E.

 How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: 
 - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let's try: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don't want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don't know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E's? But we don't have information about duplicates.

 To keep it simple, let's try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: 
   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don't know about B, O, W.

 However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn't have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.

 But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.

 Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

 So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.

 Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can try position 1: 
   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. 
     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don't know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that's 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.

 But we don't know if E is at 1. We are testing.

 However, we can also try E at position 2: 
   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That's still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.

 However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don't know about position 4.

 But we can try a word that has E in the middle.

 Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it's in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven't tried.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. And D is a common letter.

 But we don't know if D is in the word. We are testing.

 However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.

 I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.

 However, we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

 Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing P and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.

 Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it's less common.

 Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".

 I'll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.

 But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn't get an 'x'. We will get either ✓ or -.

 So let's choose ""TEPID"".

 But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.

 ""TEPID"" has I and no O? 

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. So that's acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.

 However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.

 How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.

 How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.

 So my second guess: ""SPIEL""

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.

 Also, we test S, P, I, L.

 So let's do ""SPIEL"".

<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.

The word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.

Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.\n We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.\n\n Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).\n\n We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.\n\n Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don\'t know if these letters are in the word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let\'s spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.\n\n However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don\'t know. We can try.\n\n But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it\'s not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n However, we don\'t know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.\n\n Let me think of words starting with E: but we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We might want to test other positions.\n\n Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.\n\n But we also want to test other common letters.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Possibilities: \n - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don\'t know if these are in the word.\n - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.\n - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn\'t have those. However, we don\'t know about H, O, T, L.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid the end for E.\n\n How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\n Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: \n - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let\'s try: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don\'t want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don\'t know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E\'s? But we don\'t have information about duplicates.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.\n\n But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: \n   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don\'t know about B, O, W.\n\n However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn\'t have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.\n\n But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.\n\n Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.\n\n Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include E.\n\n So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.\n\n Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We can try position 1: \n   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. \n     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don\'t know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that\'s 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if E is at 1. We are testing.\n\n However, we can also try E at position 2: \n   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Similarly, E at position 3: \n   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That\'s still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.\n\n However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don\'t know about position 4.\n\n But we can try a word that has E in the middle.\n\n Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it\'s in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. And D is a common letter.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word. We are testing.\n\n However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: \n   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.\n\n How about E at position 2? \n   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.\n\n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.\n\n   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.\n   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.\n\n We don\'t know which position E is in. So either is fine.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. \n ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n\n Both are good. I\'ll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.\n\n But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.\n\n However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.\n\n I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.\n\n However, we don\'t have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.\n\n Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.\n\n But note: we are also testing P and I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.\n\n Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it\'s less common.\n\n Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".\n\n I\'ll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.\n\n But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it\'s at position 2. If we get a \'-\', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an \'x\' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn\'t get an \'x\'. We will get either ✓ or -.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TEPID"".\n\n But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.\n\n ""TEPID"" has I and no O? \n\n Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. So that\'s acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.\n\n However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.\n\n How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.\n\n So my second guess: ""SPIEL""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.\n\n Also, we test S, P, I, L.\n\n So let\'s do ""SPIEL"".\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.\n- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").
- P is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.
- L is not in the word (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The 4th letter is E.
2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _

We know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn't try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.

Specifically:
- S is in the word but not at position 1.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the 4th letter.
- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.

So, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

We know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.

Also, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don't know yet).

We have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.

We should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.

Let me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We can consider common letters that are still available. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common ones.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.

Let me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.

The pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.

We know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.

We can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Let me try to list possible words.

For example:
- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.

So let's try to form words:

Option 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? 
But we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

Another: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.

Option 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _
But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.

Another: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P.

How about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don't know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need E at position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ E _

With I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

What can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.

Possible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let's think of common words.

Another: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.

""ISMEL"" -> not a word.

This seems difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.

""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.

We must avoid L.

Another: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.

So pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.

So the word ends with a letter at position 5.

So: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.

We know S and I must be in the first three.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

We need a word: I S ? E ?

Possible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don't know.

Another: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: I ? S E ?

What words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.

""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.

""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.

This is challenging.

Put S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.

So I cannot be at 3.

Therefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).

So let's try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.

""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.

""MSIZE"" -> not a word.

""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.

This is difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISE"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.

""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: _ I S E ?

What words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.

""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.

We need E at 4.

So: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.

But we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?

But we don't know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.

Is that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.

""DISCO"" is not ending with E.

Perhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.

So let's try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.

""BITES"" -> L forbidden.

""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

But we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven't used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.

So ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.

But note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.

But we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.

Similarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 1).

But we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.

But we don't know if I can be at 2. We are testing.

Another possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.

""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.

But let's see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.

We need E at 4.

So: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.

So the word: ? ? S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.

""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Another idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: _ S ? E I

What words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.

""ISLEI"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven't tried.

For example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.

But we also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?

With S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.

So let's try:

- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven't tried that.

We can try I at position 1.

Then the word: I ? ? E ?

But we also need S somewhere.

So I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

And the word must be valid.

We can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.

""ISIDE"" -> not a word.

""IMBUE"" -> not.

How about ""ITCHY"" -> no.

I think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.

This is difficult.

Another idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.

In ""DIKES"", we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it's at 2)
- Position 3: K (new)
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it's at 5)

This seems like a good candidate.

But we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.

Another word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).

But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.

But we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).

But we are using two S's? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.

Similarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.

But we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

But ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.

We can choose either.

But note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.

In ""DIKES"":
- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Another candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not a word.

""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.

But ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.

But we don't know about H, O, M.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.

But we don't know about T, O, W.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

In ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.

In ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider the positions for S and I.

In ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.

We must include I and S.

So ""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

We must include I and S.

So the word must contain I and S.

So ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S's. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is a common word.

But let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.

We can choose one.

But note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it's correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly for I at 2.

In ""DIKES"", we are testing:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> E at 1, but we need E at 4.

""OSIER"" -> R forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we should go with ""DIKES"" or ""BIKES"".

Let me choose ""BIKES"": B-I-K-E-S

But in ""BIKES"", we are putting I at 2 and S at 5.

We know that in the secret word, E is at 4, and we know S and I are present.

If we get feedback that I is at 2, then we know. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

Also, we test B and K.

But we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn't find a word for that.

Another word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.

We must include I.

""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.

So guess: ""BIKES""

But note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it's at 2 or 3, we get a '-'.

Similarly for I at 2.

But we are also testing B and K.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn't find a word.

Another word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.

We must have E at 4.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.

For example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was '-', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.

In ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Similarly, we cannot put S at 1.

So S must be at 2, 3, or 5.

But if we put S at 5, then we can test that.

Similarly, I at 1,2, or 5.

But if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I

And we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.

Example: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not.

""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.

Another word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is better.

I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But let me confirm: 
- B at 1: we don't know.
- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- K at 3: new letter.
- E at 4: known.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

Also, we test B and K.

So let's do ""BIKES"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.

Another word: ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.

I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think it's hard.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.

What about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""BIKES"" seems good.

Another word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""BIKES"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get '-' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get '-' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get '-'.

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don't have a word.

Or S at 3 and I at 1.

But we don't have a word for that.

Another word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5? We need E at 4.

""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:G, 5:E -> not.

I think we should go with ""BIKES"".

So my guess is ""BIKES"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E at 4: fixed.
- S is present, not at 1.
- I is present, not at 3.

In ""BIKES"", we have:
- B at 1: new
- I at 2: testing if I is at 2
- K at 3: new
- E at 4: known
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are elsewhere.

Also, we get information about B and K.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BIKES"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: spiel** → S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - S is present but not at position 1.  
  - I is present but not at position 3.  
  - P and L are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`.  
- **Present letters**: E, S, I (S cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, P, L.  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be solved, with S and I placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 5; I: positions 1, 2, or 5).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for S and I while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, K, T, O) to gather more information.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, P, L).  
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place E at position 4 (fixed).  
  - Include S and I in positions not ruled out (S not at 1, I not at 3).  
  - Use high-frequency letters like B, K, T to maximize information gain.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BIKES""
- **B** (position 1): New letter, tests if B is in the word.  
- **I** (position 2): Tests if I is at position 2 (if not, I must be at 1 or 5).  
- **K** (position 3): New letter, tests K's presence.  
- **E** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.  
- **S** (position 5): Tests if S is at position 5 (if not, S must be at 2 or 3).  

This guess efficiently tests the positions of S and I while checking two new letters (B and K). If I is at position 2, we get a ✓; if not, we learn I is at 1 or 5. Similarly, S at position 5 will reveal if it's correct or not.

<guess>bikes</guess>",bikes,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").
- P is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.
- L is not in the word (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The 4th letter is E.
2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _

We know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn't try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.

Specifically:
- S is in the word but not at position 1.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the 4th letter.
- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.

So, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

We know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.

Also, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don't know yet).

We have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.

We should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.

Let me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We can consider common letters that are still available. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common ones.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.

Let me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.

The pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.

We know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.

We can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Let me try to list possible words.

For example:
- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.

So let's try to form words:

Option 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? 
But we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

Another: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.

Option 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _
But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.

Another: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P.

How about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don't know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need E at position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ E _

With I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

What can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.

Possible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let's think of common words.

Another: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.

""ISMEL"" -> not a word.

This seems difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.

""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.

We must avoid L.

Another: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.

So pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.

So the word ends with a letter at position 5.

So: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.

We know S and I must be in the first three.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

We need a word: I S ? E ?

Possible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don't know.

Another: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: I ? S E ?

What words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.

""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.

""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.

This is challenging.

Put S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.

So I cannot be at 3.

Therefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).

So let's try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.

""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.

""MSIZE"" -> not a word.

""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.

This is difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISE"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.

""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: _ I S E ?

What words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.

""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.

We need E at 4.

So: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.

But we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?

But we don't know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.

Is that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.

""DISCO"" is not ending with E.

Perhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.

So let's try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.

""BITES"" -> L forbidden.

""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

But we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven't used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.

So ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.

But note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.

But we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.

Similarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 1).

But we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.

But we don't know if I can be at 2. We are testing.

Another possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.

""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.

But let's see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.

We need E at 4.

So: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.

So the word: ? ? S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.

""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Another idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: _ S ? E I

What words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.

""ISLEI"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven't tried.

For example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.

But we also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?

With S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.

So let's try:

- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven't tried that.

We can try I at position 1.

Then the word: I ? ? E ?

But we also need S somewhere.

So I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

And the word must be valid.

We can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.

""ISIDE"" -> not a word.

""IMBUE"" -> not.

How about ""ITCHY"" -> no.

I think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.

This is difficult.

Another idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.

In ""DIKES"", we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it's at 2)
- Position 3: K (new)
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it's at 5)

This seems like a good candidate.

But we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.

Another word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).

But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.

But we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).

But we are using two S's? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.

Similarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.

But we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

But ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.

We can choose either.

But note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.

In ""DIKES"":
- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Another candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not a word.

""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.

But ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.

But we don't know about H, O, M.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.

But we don't know about T, O, W.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

In ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.

In ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider the positions for S and I.

In ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.

We must include I and S.

So ""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

We must include I and S.

So the word must contain I and S.

So ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S's. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is a common word.

But let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.

We can choose one.

But note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it's correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly for I at 2.

In ""DIKES"", we are testing:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> E at 1, but we need E at 4.

""OSIER"" -> R forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we should go with ""DIKES"" or ""BIKES"".

Let me choose ""BIKES"": B-I-K-E-S

But in ""BIKES"", we are putting I at 2 and S at 5.

We know that in the secret word, E is at 4, and we know S and I are present.

If we get feedback that I is at 2, then we know. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

Also, we test B and K.

But we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn't find a word for that.

Another word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.

We must include I.

""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.

So guess: ""BIKES""

But note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it's at 2 or 3, we get a '-'.

Similarly for I at 2.

But we are also testing B and K.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn't find a word.

Another word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.

We must have E at 4.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.

For example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was '-', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.

In ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Similarly, we cannot put S at 1.

So S must be at 2, 3, or 5.

But if we put S at 5, then we can test that.

Similarly, I at 1,2, or 5.

But if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I

And we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.

Example: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not.

""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.

Another word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is better.

I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But let me confirm: 
- B at 1: we don't know.
- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- K at 3: new letter.
- E at 4: known.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

Also, we test B and K.

So let's do ""BIKES"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.

Another word: ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.

I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think it's hard.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.

What about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""BIKES"" seems good.

Another word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""BIKES"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get '-' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get '-' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get '-'.

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don't have a word.

Or S at 3 and I at 1.

But we don't have a word for that.

Another word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5? We need E at 4.

""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:G, 5:E -> not.

I think we should go with ""BIKES"".

So my guess is ""BIKES"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E at 4: fixed.
- S is present, not at 1.
- I is present, not at 3.

In ""BIKES"", we have:
- B at 1: new
- I at 2: testing if I is at 2
- K at 3: new
- E at 4: known
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are elsewhere.

Also, we get information about B and K.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BIKES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: spiel** → S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - S is present but not at position 1.  
  - I is present but not at position 3.  
  - P and L are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`.  
- **Present letters**: E, S, I (S cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, P, L.  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be solved, with S and I placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 5; I: positions 1, 2, or 5).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for S and I while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, K, T, O) to gather more information.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, P, L).  
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place E at position 4 (fixed).  
  - Include S and I in positions not ruled out (S not at 1, I not at 3).  
  - Use high-frequency letters like B, K, T to maximize information gain.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BIKES""
- **B** (position 1): New letter, tests if B is in the word.  
- **I** (position 2): Tests if I is at position 2 (if not, I must be at 1 or 5).  
- **K** (position 3): New letter, tests K's presence.  
- **E** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.  
- **S** (position 5): Tests if S is at position 5 (if not, S must be at 2 or 3).  

This guess efficiently tests the positions of S and I while checking two new letters (B and K). If I is at position 2, we get a ✓; if not, we learn I is at 1 or 5. Similarly, S at position 5 will reveal if it's correct or not.",Guess 3: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.
 We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).

 We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.

 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let's spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.

 However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don't know. We can try.

 But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it's not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we don't know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.

 Let me think of words starting with E: but we don't know if that's the case. We might want to test other positions.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.

 But we also want to test other common letters.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don't know if these are in the word.
 - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.
 - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn't have those. However, we don't know about H, O, T, L.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, let's avoid the end for E.

 How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: 
 - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let's try: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don't want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don't know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E's? But we don't have information about duplicates.

 To keep it simple, let's try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: 
   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don't know about B, O, W.

 However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn't have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.

 But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.

 Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

 So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.

 Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can try position 1: 
   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. 
     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don't know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that's 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.

 But we don't know if E is at 1. We are testing.

 However, we can also try E at position 2: 
   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That's still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.

 However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don't know about position 4.

 But we can try a word that has E in the middle.

 Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it's in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven't tried.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. And D is a common letter.

 But we don't know if D is in the word. We are testing.

 However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.

 How about E at position 2? 
   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.

   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.

   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.
   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.

 We don't know which position E is in. So either is fine.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. 
 ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 

 Both are good. I'll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.

 However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.

 I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.

 However, we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

 Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing P and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.

 Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it's less common.

 Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".

 I'll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.

 But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn't get an 'x'. We will get either ✓ or -.

 So let's choose ""TEPID"".

 But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.

 ""TEPID"" has I and no O? 

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. So that's acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.

 However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.

 How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.

 How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.

 So my second guess: ""SPIEL""

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.

 Also, we test S, P, I, L.

 So let's do ""SPIEL"".

<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.

The word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.

<guess>spiel</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").
- P is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.
- L is not in the word (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The 4th letter is E.
2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _

We know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn't try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.

Specifically:
- S is in the word but not at position 1.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the 4th letter.
- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.

So, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

We know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.

Also, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don't know yet).

We have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.

We should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.

Let me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We can consider common letters that are still available. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common ones.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.

Let me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.

The pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.

We know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.

We can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Let me try to list possible words.

For example:
- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.

So let's try to form words:

Option 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? 
But we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

Another: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.

Option 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _
But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.

Another: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P.

How about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don't know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need E at position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ E _

With I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

What can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.

Possible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let's think of common words.

Another: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.

""ISMEL"" -> not a word.

This seems difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.

""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.

We must avoid L.

Another: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.

So pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.

So the word ends with a letter at position 5.

So: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.

We know S and I must be in the first three.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

We need a word: I S ? E ?

Possible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don't know.

Another: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: I ? S E ?

What words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.

""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.

""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.

This is challenging.

Put S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.

So I cannot be at 3.

Therefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).

So let's try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.

""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.

""MSIZE"" -> not a word.

""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.

This is difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISE"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.

""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: _ I S E ?

What words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.

""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.

We need E at 4.

So: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.

But we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?

But we don't know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.

Is that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.

""DISCO"" is not ending with E.

Perhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.

So let's try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.

""BITES"" -> L forbidden.

""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

But we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven't used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.

So ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.

But note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.

But we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.

Similarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 1).

But we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.

But we don't know if I can be at 2. We are testing.

Another possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.

""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.

But let's see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.

We need E at 4.

So: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.

So the word: ? ? S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.

""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Another idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: _ S ? E I

What words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.

""ISLEI"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven't tried.

For example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.

But we also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?

With S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.

So let's try:

- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven't tried that.

We can try I at position 1.

Then the word: I ? ? E ?

But we also need S somewhere.

So I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

And the word must be valid.

We can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.

""ISIDE"" -> not a word.

""IMBUE"" -> not.

How about ""ITCHY"" -> no.

I think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.

This is difficult.

Another idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.

In ""DIKES"", we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it's at 2)
- Position 3: K (new)
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it's at 5)

This seems like a good candidate.

But we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.

Another word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).

But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.

But we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).

But we are using two S's? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.

Similarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.

But we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

But ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.

We can choose either.

But note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.

In ""DIKES"":
- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Another candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not a word.

""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.

But ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.

But we don't know about H, O, M.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.

But we don't know about T, O, W.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

In ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.

In ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider the positions for S and I.

In ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.

We must include I and S.

So ""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

We must include I and S.

So the word must contain I and S.

So ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S's. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is a common word.

But let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.

We can choose one.

But note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it's correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly for I at 2.

In ""DIKES"", we are testing:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> E at 1, but we need E at 4.

""OSIER"" -> R forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we should go with ""DIKES"" or ""BIKES"".

Let me choose ""BIKES"": B-I-K-E-S

But in ""BIKES"", we are putting I at 2 and S at 5.

We know that in the secret word, E is at 4, and we know S and I are present.

If we get feedback that I is at 2, then we know. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

Also, we test B and K.

But we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn't find a word for that.

Another word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.

We must include I.

""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.

So guess: ""BIKES""

But note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it's at 2 or 3, we get a '-'.

Similarly for I at 2.

But we are also testing B and K.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn't find a word.

Another word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.

We must have E at 4.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.

For example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was '-', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.

In ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Similarly, we cannot put S at 1.

So S must be at 2, 3, or 5.

But if we put S at 5, then we can test that.

Similarly, I at 1,2, or 5.

But if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I

And we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.

Example: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not.

""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.

Another word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is better.

I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But let me confirm: 
- B at 1: we don't know.
- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- K at 3: new letter.
- E at 4: known.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

Also, we test B and K.

So let's do ""BIKES"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.

Another word: ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.

I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think it's hard.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.

What about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""BIKES"" seems good.

Another word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""BIKES"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get '-' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get '-' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get '-'.

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don't have a word.

Or S at 3 and I at 1.

But we don't have a word for that.

Another word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5? We need E at 4.

""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:G, 5:E -> not.

I think we should go with ""BIKES"".

So my guess is ""BIKES"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E at 4: fixed.
- S is present, not at 1.
- I is present, not at 3.

In ""BIKES"", we have:
- B at 1: new
- I at 2: testing if I is at 2
- K at 3: new
- E at 4: known
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are elsewhere.

Also, we get information about B and K.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BIKES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: spiel** → S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - S is present but not at position 1.  
  - I is present but not at position 3.  
  - P and L are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`.  
- **Present letters**: E, S, I (S cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, P, L.  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be solved, with S and I placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 5; I: positions 1, 2, or 5).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for S and I while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, K, T, O) to gather more information.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, P, L).  
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place E at position 4 (fixed).  
  - Include S and I in positions not ruled out (S not at 1, I not at 3).  
  - Use high-frequency letters like B, K, T to maximize information gain.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BIKES""
- **B** (position 1): New letter, tests if B is in the word.  
- **I** (position 2): Tests if I is at position 2 (if not, I must be at 1 or 5).  
- **K** (position 3): New letter, tests K's presence.  
- **E** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.  
- **S** (position 5): Tests if S is at position 5 (if not, S must be at 2 or 3).  

This guess efficiently tests the positions of S and I while checking two new letters (B and K). If I is at position 2, we get a ✓; if not, we learn I is at 1 or 5. Similarly, S at position 5 will reveal if it's correct or not.

Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.\n We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.\n\n Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).\n\n We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.\n\n Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don\'t know if these letters are in the word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let\'s spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.\n\n However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don\'t know. We can try.\n\n But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it\'s not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n However, we don\'t know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.\n\n Let me think of words starting with E: but we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We might want to test other positions.\n\n Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.\n\n But we also want to test other common letters.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Possibilities: \n - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don\'t know if these are in the word.\n - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.\n - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn\'t have those. However, we don\'t know about H, O, T, L.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid the end for E.\n\n How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\n Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: \n - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let\'s try: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don\'t want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don\'t know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E\'s? But we don\'t have information about duplicates.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.\n\n But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: \n   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don\'t know about B, O, W.\n\n However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn\'t have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.\n\n But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.\n\n Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.\n\n Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include E.\n\n So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.\n\n Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We can try position 1: \n   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. \n     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don\'t know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that\'s 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if E is at 1. We are testing.\n\n However, we can also try E at position 2: \n   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Similarly, E at position 3: \n   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That\'s still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.\n\n However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don\'t know about position 4.\n\n But we can try a word that has E in the middle.\n\n Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it\'s in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. And D is a common letter.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word. We are testing.\n\n However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: \n   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.\n\n How about E at position 2? \n   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.\n\n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.\n\n   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.\n   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.\n\n We don\'t know which position E is in. So either is fine.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. \n ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n\n Both are good. I\'ll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.\n\n But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.\n\n However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.\n\n I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.\n\n However, we don\'t have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.\n\n Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.\n\n But note: we are also testing P and I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.\n\n Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it\'s less common.\n\n Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".\n\n I\'ll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.\n\n But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it\'s at position 2. If we get a \'-\', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an \'x\' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn\'t get an \'x\'. We will get either ✓ or -.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TEPID"".\n\n But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.\n\n ""TEPID"" has I and no O? \n\n Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. So that\'s acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.\n\n However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.\n\n How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.\n\n So my second guess: ""SPIEL""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.\n\n Also, we test S, P, I, L.\n\n So let\'s do ""SPIEL"".\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.\n- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").\n- P is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").\n- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.\n- L is not in the word (x).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The 4th letter is E.\n2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.\n3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn\'t try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.\n\nSpecifically:\n- S is in the word but not at position 1.\n- I is in the word but not at position 3.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has E as the 4th letter.\n- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nAdditionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.\n\nSo, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don\'t know yet).\n\nWe have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.\n\nWe should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.\n\nLet me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nWe can consider common letters that are still available. We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common ones.\n\nWe need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.\n\nThe pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.\n\nWe know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.\n\nWe can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know the exact positions.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nLet me try to list possible words.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.\n\nSo let\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? \nBut we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.\n\nAnother: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.\n\n""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.\n\nOption 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _\nBut we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.\n\nAnother: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.\n\nWe must avoid P.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don\'t know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ _ E _\n\nWith I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.\n\nLet me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?\n\nWhat can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.\n\nPossible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let\'s think of common words.\n\nAnother: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.\n\n""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""ISMEL"" -> not a word.\n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.\n\n""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.\n\nWe must avoid L.\n\nAnother: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.\n\nSo pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.\n\nSo the word ends with a letter at position 5.\n\nSo: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.\n\nWe know S and I must be in the first three.\n\nLet me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?\n\nWe need a word: I S ? E ?\n\nPossible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.\n\n""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.\n\nWe need to end with E at 4.\n\nSo: I ? S E ?\n\nWhat words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.\n\n""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.\n\n""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nPut S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.\n\nSo I cannot be at 3.\n\nTherefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).\n\nSo let\'s try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.\n\n""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.\n\n""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.\n\n""MSIZE"" -> not a word.\n\n""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?\n\nExample: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""WISE"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n""WISER"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.\n\n""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.\n\nWe need to end with E at 4.\n\nSo: _ I S E ?\n\nWhat words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.\n\n""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\nSo: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.\n\nBut we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.\n\nSo the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?\n\nBut we don\'t know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.\n\nIs that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.\n\n""DISCO"" is not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""BITES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven\'t used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nSo ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.\n\nBut note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.\n\nBut we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not at 1).\n\nBut we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I can be at 2. We are testing.\n\nAnother possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I\n\nExample: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.\n\n""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\nSo: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.\n\nSo the word: ? ? S E I\n\nExample: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nAnother idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.\n\n""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.\n\n""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: _ S ? E I\n\nWhat words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.\n\n""ISLEI"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven\'t tried.\n\nFor example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> not.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters.\n\nWe have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?\n\nWith S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.\n\nSo let\'s try:\n\n- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven\'t tried that.\n\nWe can try I at position 1.\n\nThen the word: I ? ? E ?\n\nBut we also need S somewhere.\n\nSo I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?\n\nBut we need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWe can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.\n\n""ISIDE"" -> not a word.\n\n""IMBUE"" -> not.\n\nHow about ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\nI think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 5.\n\nExample: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""WISER"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.\n\nIn ""DIKES"", we have:\n- Position 1: D (new)\n- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it\'s at 2)\n- Position 3: K (new)\n- Position 4: E (known)\n- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it\'s at 5)\n\nThis seems like a good candidate.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).\n\nBut let\'s see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.\n\nBut we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).\n\nBut we are using two S\'s? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.\n\nSimilarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.\n\nBut we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.\n\nBut we are repeating S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""FICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.\n\nIn ""DIKES"":\n- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.\n- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nBut we are also testing D and K.\n\nAnother candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> no.\n\n""IVORY"" -> no.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> no.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> no.\n\nI think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""TOISE"" -> not a word.\n\n""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.\n\nBut ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H, O, M.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know about T, O, W.\n\nBut we are testing multiple new letters.\n\nIn ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.\n\nIn ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions for S and I.\n\nIn ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.\n\nWe must include I and S.\n\nSo ""HOMES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include I and S.\n\nSo the word must contain I and S.\n\nSo ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\n""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\n""HOMES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S\'s. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is not common.\n\n""BIKES"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it\'s correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for I at 2.\n\nIn ""DIKES"", we are testing:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don\'t know)\n- Position 3: K\n- Position 4: E (known)\n- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)\n\nIf we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nBut we are also testing D and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ?

If not, then I is at 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nAlso, we test B and K.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn\'t find a word for that.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.\n\nWe must include I.\n\n""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.\n\nSo guess: ""BIKES""\n\nBut note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it\'s at 2 or 3, we get a \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for I at 2.\n\nBut we are also testing B and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn\'t find a word.\n\nAnother word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.\n\nWe must have E at 4.\n\nSo I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.\n\nFor example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was \'-\', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.\n\nIn ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put S at 1.\n\nSo S must be at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut if we put S at 5, then we can test that.\n\nSimilarly, I at 1,2, or 5.\n\nBut if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I\n\nAnd we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.\n\nExample: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""TOISE"" -> not.\n\n""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""FICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is not common.\n\n""BIKES"" is better.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- B at 1: we don\'t know.\n- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.\n- K at 3: new letter.\n- E at 4: known.\n- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.\n- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.\n\nIf not, we get \'-\' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.\n\nAlso, we test B and K.\n\nSo let\'s do ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> no.\n\n""IVORY"" -> no.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> no.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> no.\n\nI think it\'s hard.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.\n\nWhat about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""BIKES"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""BIKES"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get \'-\' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get \'-\' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get \'-\'.\n\nBut we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don\'t have a word.\n\nOr S at 3 and I at 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word for that.\n\nAnother word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5?

If I is at position 2, we get a ✓; if not, we learn I is at 1 or 5. Similarly, S at position 5 will reveal if it\'s correct or not.\n\n<guess>bikes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)\nGuess 3: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
  - E is in the correct position (position 4).
  - S is in the word but not at position 1.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3.
  - P and L are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(✓), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in the correct position (position 2).
  - K is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 4) - already known.
  - S is in the correct position (position 5).
  - B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ I K E S
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: K
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Only position 1 is unknown.

Therefore, the word is: ? I K E S

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (call it X) and then ""IKES"", so X + ""IKES"" = XIKES.

We know that X cannot be:
- C, R, A, N (from guess 1)
- P, L (from guess 2)
- B (from guess 3)

Also, from guess 1, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because E is at 4.

Now, what letters are possible for X?
- It must be a letter not in the forbidden set: C, R, A, N, P, L, B.
- It must form a valid English word.

Common letters that are not forbidden: D, F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word that ends with ""IKES"".

Possible words:
- ""DIKES"" - but D is not forbidden? We haven't used D.
- ""MIKES"" - M is not forbidden.
- ""VIKES"" - V is not forbidden.
- ""TIKES"" - not a common word? Maybe not valid.
- ""HIKES"" - H is not forbidden.
- ""YIKES"" - Y is not forbidden, but it's informal? Maybe not ideal.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

Actually, ""DIKES"", ""MIKES"", ""HIKES"", ""VIKES"", etc.

But note: in guess 3, we used ""bikes"" and got B wrong, but we have the correct IKES part.

Now, we know that the first letter is not B, and not the forbidden ones.

We have to choose one.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had E as present but not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, which one to pick? We can try ""DIKES"" because D is a common letter.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Alternatively, we can think: we have only one position left, so we can guess one of the possibilities.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can try one.

But we can also think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one position, so it's straightforward.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the possibilities without forbidden letters:
- D: ""DIKES""
- M: ""MIKES""
- H: ""HIKES""
- V: ""VIKES""
- F: ""FIKES"" - not a common word? (Fikes? Not sure)
- G: ""GIKES"" - not a word
- J: ""JIKES"" - not a word
- O: ""OIKES"" - not a word
- Q: ""QUIKES"" - not 5 letters? ""Quikes"" is not standard.
- T: ""TIKES"" - not a common word? (Tikes? Maybe as a name)
- U: ""UIKES"" - not a word
- W: ""WIKES"" - not a word
- X: ""IXNES"" - not, and X is not common here.
- Y: ""YIKES"" - informal, might not be accepted. But let's see: in word games, ""yikes"" is sometimes accepted as an interjection. However, we should stick to common words.

Common words: 
- ""DIKES"" (plural of dike)
- ""MIKES"" (not a common word? But ""mike"" is a name, but ""mikes"" might be plural? Actually, ""mikes"" is acceptable in some word lists)
- ""HIKES"" (hikes, plural of hike)
- ""VIKES"" (not common; vikes might refer to Vikings, but not general term)

The most common words are ""DIKES"" and ""HIKES"".

We can try ""DIKES"" first.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list.

Since we are playing by the rules, ""DIKES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""HIKES"" is valid.

But we have two options. We can choose one.

Alternatively, we can think: in the first guess, we had E as present, and now we have E at 4, which is consistent.

But we don't have any other constraints.

We can also consider that we have not used D, H, M, etc.

But we have to guess one.

Let me pick ""DIKES"".

But wait: in guess 2, we had ""spiel"" which had S at 1 and I at 3, both wrong positions. Now in ""DIKES"", we have:
- D at 1: new
- I at 2: we know is correct (from guess 3, I is ✓ at 2)
- K at 3: we know is correct (from guess 3, K is ✓ at 3)
- E at 4: correct
- S at 5: we know is correct (from guess 3, S is ✓ at 5)

So if we guess ""DIKES"", we are only testing D at position 1.

If D is correct, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -? But D is at position 1, so if D is not in the word, we get x. If D is in the word but not at 1, we get -.

But we know the word is ?IKES, so the only unknown is the first letter.

So by guessing ""DIKES"", we can confirm if D is the first letter.

Similarly, we could guess ""HIKES"" to test H.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have multiple guesses left, we can pick one.

I'll go with ""DIKES"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to cover more ground? But in this case, we are only testing one letter.

However, we have 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and this is the fourth).

But we can also consider: we know the word is ?IKES. We can try ""DIKES"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we can also think: is there a word that has more than one new letter? But we only have one position.

So I think ""DIKES"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""DIKES"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters. D is not forbidden.

So <guess>dikes</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **I** is confirmed at position 2 (from Guess 3).
- **K** is confirmed at position 3 (from Guess 3).
- **S** is confirmed at position 5 (from Guess 3).
- **E** is not at position 5 (from Guess 1), which is consistent with the current E position.

The secret word pattern is: `_ I K E S`. Only position 1 is unknown.

**Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), P, L (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). So absent: **C, R, A, N, P, L, B**.

**Possible words**: The word must be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""IKES"". Common options include:
- **DIKES** (plural of ""dike"")
- **HIKES** (plural of ""hike"")
- **MIKES** (less common, but possible; may refer to ""mike"" as a name)
- **VIKES** (variant of ""vike"", not commonly used)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only position 1 is unknown. We need to test the first letter using a valid word.
- **DIKES** is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and try another candidate (e.g., HIKES or MIKES) in subsequent guesses.

Given that, we guess **DIKES** to efficiently confirm or rule out D.

<guess>dikes</guess>",dikes,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
  - E is in the correct position (position 4).
  - S is in the word but not at position 1.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3.
  - P and L are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(✓), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in the correct position (position 2).
  - K is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 4) - already known.
  - S is in the correct position (position 5).
  - B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ I K E S
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: K
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Only position 1 is unknown.

Therefore, the word is: ? I K E S

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (call it X) and then ""IKES"", so X + ""IKES"" = XIKES.

We know that X cannot be:
- C, R, A, N (from guess 1)
- P, L (from guess 2)
- B (from guess 3)

Also, from guess 1, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because E is at 4.

Now, what letters are possible for X?
- It must be a letter not in the forbidden set: C, R, A, N, P, L, B.
- It must form a valid English word.

Common letters that are not forbidden: D, F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word that ends with ""IKES"".

Possible words:
- ""DIKES"" - but D is not forbidden? We haven't used D.
- ""MIKES"" - M is not forbidden.
- ""VIKES"" - V is not forbidden.
- ""TIKES"" - not a common word? Maybe not valid.
- ""HIKES"" - H is not forbidden.
- ""YIKES"" - Y is not forbidden, but it's informal? Maybe not ideal.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

Actually, ""DIKES"", ""MIKES"", ""HIKES"", ""VIKES"", etc.

But note: in guess 3, we used ""bikes"" and got B wrong, but we have the correct IKES part.

Now, we know that the first letter is not B, and not the forbidden ones.

We have to choose one.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had E as present but not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, which one to pick? We can try ""DIKES"" because D is a common letter.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Alternatively, we can think: we have only one position left, so we can guess one of the possibilities.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can try one.

But we can also think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one position, so it's straightforward.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the possibilities without forbidden letters:
- D: ""DIKES""
- M: ""MIKES""
- H: ""HIKES""
- V: ""VIKES""
- F: ""FIKES"" - not a common word? (Fikes? Not sure)
- G: ""GIKES"" - not a word
- J: ""JIKES"" - not a word
- O: ""OIKES"" - not a word
- Q: ""QUIKES"" - not 5 letters? ""Quikes"" is not standard.
- T: ""TIKES"" - not a common word? (Tikes? Maybe as a name)
- U: ""UIKES"" - not a word
- W: ""WIKES"" - not a word
- X: ""IXNES"" - not, and X is not common here.
- Y: ""YIKES"" - informal, might not be accepted. But let's see: in word games, ""yikes"" is sometimes accepted as an interjection. However, we should stick to common words.

Common words: 
- ""DIKES"" (plural of dike)
- ""MIKES"" (not a common word? But ""mike"" is a name, but ""mikes"" might be plural? Actually, ""mikes"" is acceptable in some word lists)
- ""HIKES"" (hikes, plural of hike)
- ""VIKES"" (not common; vikes might refer to Vikings, but not general term)

The most common words are ""DIKES"" and ""HIKES"".

We can try ""DIKES"" first.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list.

Since we are playing by the rules, ""DIKES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""HIKES"" is valid.

But we have two options. We can choose one.

Alternatively, we can think: in the first guess, we had E as present, and now we have E at 4, which is consistent.

But we don't have any other constraints.

We can also consider that we have not used D, H, M, etc.

But we have to guess one.

Let me pick ""DIKES"".

But wait: in guess 2, we had ""spiel"" which had S at 1 and I at 3, both wrong positions. Now in ""DIKES"", we have:
- D at 1: new
- I at 2: we know is correct (from guess 3, I is ✓ at 2)
- K at 3: we know is correct (from guess 3, K is ✓ at 3)
- E at 4: correct
- S at 5: we know is correct (from guess 3, S is ✓ at 5)

So if we guess ""DIKES"", we are only testing D at position 1.

If D is correct, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -? But D is at position 1, so if D is not in the word, we get x. If D is in the word but not at 1, we get -.

But we know the word is ?IKES, so the only unknown is the first letter.

So by guessing ""DIKES"", we can confirm if D is the first letter.

Similarly, we could guess ""HIKES"" to test H.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have multiple guesses left, we can pick one.

I'll go with ""DIKES"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to cover more ground? But in this case, we are only testing one letter.

However, we have 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and this is the fourth).

But we can also consider: we know the word is ?IKES. We can try ""DIKES"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we can also think: is there a word that has more than one new letter? But we only have one position.

So I think ""DIKES"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""DIKES"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters. D is not forbidden.

So <guess>dikes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **I** is confirmed at position 2 (from Guess 3).
- **K** is confirmed at position 3 (from Guess 3).
- **S** is confirmed at position 5 (from Guess 3).
- **E** is not at position 5 (from Guess 1), which is consistent with the current E position.

The secret word pattern is: `_ I K E S`. Only position 1 is unknown.

**Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), P, L (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). So absent: **C, R, A, N, P, L, B**.

**Possible words**: The word must be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""IKES"". Common options include:
- **DIKES** (plural of ""dike"")
- **HIKES** (plural of ""hike"")
- **MIKES** (less common, but possible; may refer to ""mike"" as a name)
- **VIKES** (variant of ""vike"", not commonly used)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only position 1 is unknown. We need to test the first letter using a valid word.
- **DIKES** is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and try another candidate (e.g., HIKES or MIKES) in subsequent guesses.

Given that, we guess **DIKES** to efficiently confirm or rule out D.",Guess 4: dikes -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since we placed it at the end and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter E, and does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter E (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.
 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.
 We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.

 Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).

 We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don't know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.

 Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.

 Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don't know if these letters are in the word.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let's spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.

 However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don't know. We can try.

 But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it's not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.

 However, we don't know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.

 Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.

 Let me think of words starting with E: but we don't know if that's the case. We might want to test other positions.

 Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it's not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.

 But we also want to test other common letters.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.

 Possibilities: 
 - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don't know if these are in the word.
 - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.
 - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn't have those. However, we don't know about H, O, T, L.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.

 Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.

 Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.

 Therefore, let's avoid the end for E.

 How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.

 Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: 
 - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let's try: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don't want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don't know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E's? But we don't have information about duplicates.

 To keep it simple, let's try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.

 How about ""SPIEL"": 
   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.

 But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: 
   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. 
   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. 
   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don't know about B, O, W.

 However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn't have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.

 But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.

 Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.

 I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.

 Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word. So we have to include E.

 So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.

 Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.

 Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can try position 1: 
   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. 
     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don't know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that's 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.

 But we don't know if E is at 1. We are testing.

 However, we can also try E at position 2: 
   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.

 Similarly, E at position 3: 
   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That's still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.

 However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don't know about position 4.

 But we can try a word that has E in the middle.

 Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.

 But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it's in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven't tried.

 Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.

 How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. And D is a common letter.

 But we don't know if D is in the word. We are testing.

 However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: 
   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.

 How about E at position 2? 
   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.

   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.

   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.

 Let me compare:
   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.
   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.

 We don't know which position E is in. So either is fine.

 But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. 
 ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. 

 Both are good. I'll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.

 But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.

 However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.

 I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.

 I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.

 However, we don't have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.

 Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.

 But note: we are also testing P and I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.

 How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.

 How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.

 Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.

 But we don't know about S, T, U, P.

 I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it's less common.

 Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".

 I'll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.

 But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a '-', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an 'x' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn't get an 'x'. We will get either ✓ or -.

 So let's choose ""TEPID"".

 But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.

 ""TEPID"" has I and no O? 

 Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.

 How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That's not 5. So that's acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.

 However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.

 But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.

 How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.

 How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.

 Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.

 I think I'll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.

 So my second guess: ""SPIEL""

 But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.

 Also, we test S, P, I, L.

 So let's do ""SPIEL"".

<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **E** (since it's confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.
- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.

The word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).

This guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.

<guess>spiel</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
Meaning:
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").
- P is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").
- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.
- L is not in the word (x).

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The 4th letter is E.
2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.
3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.

Also, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _

We know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn't try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.

Specifically:
- S is in the word but not at position 1.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.

Also, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has E as the 4th letter.
- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.

Additionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.

So, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _

We know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.

Also, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don't know yet).

We have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.

We should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.

Let me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.

Similarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.

We also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.

We can consider common letters that are still available. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common ones.

We need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.

Let me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.

The pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.

We know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.

We can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions.

We can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

Let me try to list possible words.

For example:
- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.
- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.

But we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.

So let's try to form words:

Option 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? 
But we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

Another: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.

Option 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _
But we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.

Another: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.

We must avoid P.

How about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don't know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need E at position 4.

So pattern: _ _ _ E _

With I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

What can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.

Possible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let's think of common words.

Another: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.

""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.

""ISMEL"" -> not a word.

This seems difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.

""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.

We must avoid L.

Another: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.

We need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.

So pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.

So the word ends with a letter at position 5.

So: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.

We know S and I must be in the first three.

Let me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?

We need a word: I S ? E ?

Possible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.

""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don't know.

Another: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: I ? S E ?

What words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.

""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.

""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.

This is challenging.

Put S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.

So I cannot be at 3.

Therefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.

Similarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).

So let's try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.

""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.

""MSIZE"" -> not a word.

""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.

This is difficult.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISE"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.

""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.

We need to end with E at 4.

So: _ I S E ?

What words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.

""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.

We need E at 4.

So: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.

But we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?

But we don't know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.

Is that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.

""DISCO"" is not ending with E.

Perhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.

So let's try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.

""BITES"" -> L forbidden.

""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.

But we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven't used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.

So ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.

But note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.

But we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got '-', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.

Similarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it's not at 1).

But we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.

But we don't know if I can be at 2. We are testing.

Another possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.

""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don't know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.

But let's see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.

We need E at 4.

So: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.

So the word: ? ? S E I

Example: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.

""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.

""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Another idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

So: _ S ? E I

What words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.

""ISLEI"" -> not a word.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven't tried.

For example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.

But we also need to test new letters.

We have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?

With S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.

So let's try:

- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven't tried that.

We can try I at position 1.

Then the word: I ? ? E ?

But we also need S somewhere.

So I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?

But we need a letter for position 3 and 5.

And the word must be valid.

We can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.

""ISIDE"" -> not a word.

""IMBUE"" -> not.

How about ""ITCHY"" -> no.

I think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Example: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.

""WISER"" -> R forbidden.

""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.

This is difficult.

Another idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.

In ""DIKES"", we have:
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it's at 2)
- Position 3: K (new)
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it's at 5)

This seems like a good candidate.

But we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.

Another word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).

But let's see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.

But we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).

But we are using two S's? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.

Similarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.

But we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

But ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.

We can choose either.

But note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.

In ""DIKES"":
- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Another candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not a word.

""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.

But ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.

But we don't know about H, O, M.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.

But we don't know about T, O, W.

But we are testing multiple new letters.

In ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.

In ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider the positions for S and I.

In ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.

We must include I and S.

So ""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

Similarly, ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

We must include I and S.

So the word must contain I and S.

So ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

""HOMES"" doesn't have I.

""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S's. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is a common word.

But let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.

We can choose one.

But note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it's correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.

Similarly for I at 2.

In ""DIKES"", we are testing:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don't know)
- Position 3: K
- Position 4: E (known)
- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)

If we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

But we are also testing D and K.

Alternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ? E I

We need a letter for position 1 and 3.

Example: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""ASKED"" -> A forbidden.

""EXIST"" -> E at 1, but we need E at 4.

""OSIER"" -> R forbidden.

""ASIDE"" -> A forbidden.

This is hard.

Put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.

""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.

""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.

""IDYLL"" -> not.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> not.

I think we should go with ""DIKES"" or ""BIKES"".

Let me choose ""BIKES"": B-I-K-E-S

But in ""BIKES"", we are putting I at 2 and S at 5.

We know that in the secret word, E is at 4, and we know S and I are present.

If we get feedback that I is at 2, then we know. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.

Similarly for S at 5.

Also, we test B and K.

But we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn't find a word for that.

Another word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.

We must include I.

""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.

Similarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.

But let me check the dictionary: both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.

So guess: ""BIKES""

But note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it's at 2 or 3, we get a '-'.

Similarly for I at 2.

But we are also testing B and K.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn't find a word.

Another word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.

We must have E at 4.

So I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.

For example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was '-', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.

In ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.

Similarly, we cannot put S at 1.

So S must be at 2, 3, or 5.

But if we put S at 5, then we can test that.

Similarly, I at 1,2, or 5.

But if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I

And we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.

Example: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.

""TOISE"" -> not.

""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.

Another word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""FICES"" -> C forbidden.

""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.

But ""VISES"" is not common.

""BIKES"" is better.

I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But let me confirm: 
- B at 1: we don't know.
- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.
- K at 3: new letter.
- E at 4: known.
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.

Also, we test B and K.

So let's do ""BIKES"".

But note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.

Another word: ""TOWES"" doesn't have I.

""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.

I think ""BIKES"" is fine.

But let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?

We need a letter for position 2 and 5.

Example: ""ITCHY"" -> no.

""IMPEL"" -> no.

""IVORY"" -> no.

""IDYLL"" -> no.

How about ""IMBUE"" -> no.

I think it's hard.

So I'll go with ""BIKES"".

But wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.

What about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.

""BIKES"" seems good.

Another word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.

""BIKES"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get '-' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get '-' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get '-'.

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don't have a word.

Or S at 3 and I at 1.

But we don't have a word for that.

Another word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5? We need E at 4.

""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:G, 5:E -> not.

I think we should go with ""BIKES"".

So my guess is ""BIKES"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have.

We know:
- E at 4: fixed.
- S is present, not at 1.
- I is present, not at 3.

In ""BIKES"", we have:
- B at 1: new
- I at 2: testing if I is at 2
- K at 3: new
- E at 4: known
- S at 5: testing if S is at 5

If we get:
- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.
- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.

If not, we get '-' for I and S, meaning they are elsewhere.

Also, we get information about B and K.

So it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""BIKES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
  - C, R, A, N are absent.  

- **Guess 2: spiel** → S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)  
  - E is confirmed at position 4.  
  - S is present but not at position 1.  
  - I is present but not at position 3.  
  - P and L are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`.  
- **Present letters**: E, S, I (S cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3).  
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, P, L.  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be solved, with S and I placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 5; I: positions 1, 2, or 5).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test possible positions for S and I while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, K, T, O) to gather more information.  
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, P, L).  
- Prioritize words that:  
  - Place E at position 4 (fixed).  
  - Include S and I in positions not ruled out (S not at 1, I not at 3).  
  - Use high-frequency letters like B, K, T to maximize information gain.  

### Chosen Guess: ""BIKES""
- **B** (position 1): New letter, tests if B is in the word.  
- **I** (position 2): Tests if I is at position 2 (if not, I must be at 1 or 5).  
- **K** (position 3): New letter, tests K's presence.  
- **E** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.  
- **S** (position 5): Tests if S is at position 5 (if not, S must be at 2 or 3).  

This guess efficiently tests the positions of S and I while checking two new letters (B and K). If I is at position 2, we get a ✓; if not, we learn I is at 1 or 5. Similarly, S at position 5 will reveal if it's correct or not.

<guess>bikes</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.
  - C, R, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)
  - E is in the correct position (position 4).
  - S is in the word but not at position 1.
  - I is in the word but not at position 3.
  - P and L are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""bikes"" -> B(x), I(✓), K(✓), E(✓), S(✓)
  - I is in the correct position (position 2).
  - K is in the correct position (position 3).
  - E is in the correct position (position 4) - already known.
  - S is in the correct position (position 5).
  - B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ I K E S
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: K
  - Position 4: E
  - Position 5: S
- Only position 1 is unknown.

Therefore, the word is: ? I K E S

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (call it X) and then ""IKES"", so X + ""IKES"" = XIKES.

We know that X cannot be:
- C, R, A, N (from guess 1)
- P, L (from guess 2)
- B (from guess 3)

Also, from guess 1, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because E is at 4.

Now, what letters are possible for X?
- It must be a letter not in the forbidden set: C, R, A, N, P, L, B.
- It must form a valid English word.

Common letters that are not forbidden: D, F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a word that ends with ""IKES"".

Possible words:
- ""DIKES"" - but D is not forbidden? We haven't used D.
- ""MIKES"" - M is not forbidden.
- ""VIKES"" - V is not forbidden.
- ""TIKES"" - not a common word? Maybe not valid.
- ""HIKES"" - H is not forbidden.
- ""YIKES"" - Y is not forbidden, but it's informal? Maybe not ideal.

But we need to check if they are valid words.

Actually, ""DIKES"", ""MIKES"", ""HIKES"", ""VIKES"", etc.

But note: in guess 3, we used ""bikes"" and got B wrong, but we have the correct IKES part.

Now, we know that the first letter is not B, and not the forbidden ones.

We have to choose one.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had E as present but not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, which one to pick? We can try ""DIKES"" because D is a common letter.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Alternatively, we can think: we have only one position left, so we can guess one of the possibilities.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can try one.

But we can also think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one position, so it's straightforward.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters.

Let me list the possibilities without forbidden letters:
- D: ""DIKES""
- M: ""MIKES""
- H: ""HIKES""
- V: ""VIKES""
- F: ""FIKES"" - not a common word? (Fikes? Not sure)
- G: ""GIKES"" - not a word
- J: ""JIKES"" - not a word
- O: ""OIKES"" - not a word
- Q: ""QUIKES"" - not 5 letters? ""Quikes"" is not standard.
- T: ""TIKES"" - not a common word? (Tikes? Maybe as a name)
- U: ""UIKES"" - not a word
- W: ""WIKES"" - not a word
- X: ""IXNES"" - not, and X is not common here.
- Y: ""YIKES"" - informal, might not be accepted. But let's see: in word games, ""yikes"" is sometimes accepted as an interjection. However, we should stick to common words.

Common words: 
- ""DIKES"" (plural of dike)
- ""MIKES"" (not a common word? But ""mike"" is a name, but ""mikes"" might be plural? Actually, ""mikes"" is acceptable in some word lists)
- ""HIKES"" (hikes, plural of hike)
- ""VIKES"" (not common; vikes might refer to Vikings, but not general term)

The most common words are ""DIKES"" and ""HIKES"".

We can try ""DIKES"" first.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list.

Since we are playing by the rules, ""DIKES"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""HIKES"" is valid.

But we have two options. We can choose one.

Alternatively, we can think: in the first guess, we had E as present, and now we have E at 4, which is consistent.

But we don't have any other constraints.

We can also consider that we have not used D, H, M, etc.

But we have to guess one.

Let me pick ""DIKES"".

But wait: in guess 2, we had ""spiel"" which had S at 1 and I at 3, both wrong positions. Now in ""DIKES"", we have:
- D at 1: new
- I at 2: we know is correct (from guess 3, I is ✓ at 2)
- K at 3: we know is correct (from guess 3, K is ✓ at 3)
- E at 4: correct
- S at 5: we know is correct (from guess 3, S is ✓ at 5)

So if we guess ""DIKES"", we are only testing D at position 1.

If D is correct, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -? But D is at position 1, so if D is not in the word, we get x. If D is in the word but not at 1, we get -.

But we know the word is ?IKES, so the only unknown is the first letter.

So by guessing ""DIKES"", we can confirm if D is the first letter.

Similarly, we could guess ""HIKES"" to test H.

But we have to choose one.

Since we have multiple guesses left, we can pick one.

I'll go with ""DIKES"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to cover more ground? But in this case, we are only testing one letter.

However, we have 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and this is the fourth).

But we can also consider: we know the word is ?IKES. We can try ""DIKES"".

If it's not, then we try another.

But we can also think: is there a word that has more than one new letter? But we only have one position.

So I think ""DIKES"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""DIKES"".

But note: we must avoid the forbidden letters. D is not forbidden.

So <guess>dikes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **I** is confirmed at position 2 (from Guess 3).
- **K** is confirmed at position 3 (from Guess 3).
- **S** is confirmed at position 5 (from Guess 3).
- **E** is not at position 5 (from Guess 1), which is consistent with the current E position.

The secret word pattern is: `_ I K E S`. Only position 1 is unknown.

**Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), P, L (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). So absent: **C, R, A, N, P, L, B**.

**Possible words**: The word must be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""IKES"". Common options include:
- **DIKES** (plural of ""dike"")
- **HIKES** (plural of ""hike"")
- **MIKES** (less common, but possible; may refer to ""mike"" as a name)
- **VIKES** (variant of ""vike"", not commonly used)

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Only position 1 is unknown. We need to test the first letter using a valid word.
- **DIKES** is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and try another candidate (e.g., HIKES or MIKES) in subsequent guesses.

Given that, we guess **DIKES** to efficiently confirm or rule out D.

Includes the letter E (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the end.\n 2. Avoids the letters C, R, A, N.\n 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at the end, we can try placing E in the beginning, middle, or other positions.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have used: C, R, A, N, E.\n We should avoid C, R, A, N, and use E again but in a different position.\n\n Some common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but we know A is out).\n\n We can try a word that has E in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if E is at the start. We can try to put E in a different position.\n\n Also, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me think of words that have E and avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Example: ""SPIEL"" - but that has 5 letters? S-P-I-E-L -> 5 letters. However, we don\'t know if these letters are in the word.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N, C. So ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. None of these are in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N). And E is in the fourth position? Actually, in ""SPIEL"", E is the fourth letter? Let\'s spell: S-P-I-E-L -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:E, 5:L. So E is at position 4.\n\n However, we know E is in the word but not at position 5 (from the first guess). It could be at position 4? We don\'t know. We can try.\n\n But note: we have to consider that E might be in a different position. We had E at the end and it was wrong, so it must be in one of the first three positions? Actually, it could be in any position except the fifth? But wait, the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in the fifth position. So E is in one of positions 1,2,3, or 4? Actually, positions are 1 to 5. We placed E at position 5 and it\'s not there, so E is in position 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n However, we don\'t know which one. So we can try to put E in a new position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use E in the first position? For example, ""E"" at the beginning.\n\n Let me think of words starting with E: but we don\'t know if that\'s the case. We might want to test other positions.\n\n Another idea: since we have only one known letter (E) and we know it\'s not at the end, we can try to put E in the middle or beginning to see if it appears there.\n\n But we also want to test other common letters.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in a position other than 5.\n\n Possibilities: \n - E in position 1: e.g., ""E"", then four new letters. Example: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T, and I). However, we don\'t know if these are in the word.\n - E in position 2: e.g., ""LEMON"" (but has M, O, N) -> but N is forbidden! We cannot use N. So avoid N.\n - E in position 3: e.g., ""HOTEL"" (H, O, T, E, L) -> but we have to avoid A, R, C, N? This word doesn\'t have those. However, we don\'t know about H, O, T, L.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me try to form a word that has E and uses other common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is acceptable: S, P, I, E, L. But in ""SPIEL"", E is at position 4. We can also consider words with E at position 1,2,3.\n\n Another common word: ""HOUSE"" -> H, O, U, S, E. But E is at the end again? We know E is not at the end? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at the fifth position. So we cannot put E at the end again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at the end.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid the end for E.\n\n How about ""HOUSE"" is not good because E is at the end. We need a word that has E in positions 1-4.\n\n Let me try ""E"" at the beginning: \n - ""E"" followed by: we can use any letters except C, R, A, N. So let\'s try: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   Example: ""ELOPE"" -> but has O, L, P, E? But E is at the end? No, ""ELOPE"" is E-L-O-P-E -> E at 1 and 5. We know E is not at 5, so if we use this, we are repeating E at 5 which we know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n We can try ""EDGES"" -> but has D, G, E, S. However, E is at position 2 and 5? We don\'t want E at 5. Also, we are repeating E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s? The feedback only told us that E is in the word (at least one E). But it might have two? However, we don\'t know. So we can try a word with one E for now? Or we can try a word with two E\'s? But we don\'t have information about duplicates.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s try to use E only once and in a position other than 5.\n\n How about ""SPIEL"": \n   S at position 1, P at 2, I at 3, E at 4, L at 5.\n\n But note: we are not sure if E is at 4. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try E at position 1: \n   ""E"" at 1, then we need four more letters. Example: ""E"" + [new letters]. \n   How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then common letters: ""E"", ""S"", ""T"", ""O"", ""L"" -> ""ESTOL""? Not a word. \n   ""E"" at 1 and then another common word: ""ELBOW"" -> but has B, O, W. But we don\'t know about B, O, W.\n\n However, we can use ""ELBOW"" but that doesn\'t have E in the first? Actually, ""ELBOW"" is E-L-B-O-W -> E at position 1.\n\n But let me check: we want to maximize information. We know E is in the word, so we can try to put it in a different position to see if it appears there.\n\n Since we have only one known letter, we can try to use E in a new position and also test other common letters.\n\n I think ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and uses common letters. But let me see if we can get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the middle and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can try O and I.\n\n Another idea: ""TOILS"" -> T, O, I, L, S. But this word doesn\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include E.\n\n So we need a word that includes E and avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Let me list some words without C, R, A, N and with E in positions 1-4.\n\n Positions for E: we can try position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We can try position 1: \n   Words: ""E"", then four other letters (not C, R, A, N). \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" + [new] = ""E"" + [letter1, letter2, letter3, letter4]. \n     Common: ""EIGHT"" (but has G, H, T) -> but E is at 1 and then I, G, H, T. But we don\'t know about I, G, H, T. However, note that ""EIGHT"" has E at 1 and then I at 2? Actually, ""EIGHT"" is E-I-G-H-T? No, wait: E-I-G-H-T -> that\'s 5 letters? E (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5). So E is at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if E is at 1. We are testing.\n\n However, we can also try E at position 2: \n   Example: ""LEMON"" -> but L, E, M, O, N -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. And avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n Similarly, E at position 3: \n   ""HOTEL"" -> H, O, T, E, L -> E at position 4? Actually, H(1), O(2), T(3), E(4), L(5). So E is at 4? Then we are repeating the end? We want to avoid the end? Actually, we know E is not at the end, so we should avoid putting E at the end. But in ""HOTEL"", E is at the fourth? That\'s still the end? Actually, the end is position 5. So position 4 is not the end? But we are trying to find the position.\n\n However, we know E is not at position 5, so we should avoid position 5. But position 4 is adjacent to 5. We don\'t know about position 4.\n\n But we can try a word that has E in the middle.\n\n Let me choose a word that has E in a new position and uses common letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> E at position 4 (which is not 5). And we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n But note: we are not forced to use E again? Actually, we must use E because we know it\'s in the word. But we are allowed to reuse a known present letter in a different position.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E and also other common letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n Another common word: ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at position 5. So we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""PILED"": P, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. And D is a common letter.\n\n But we don\'t know if D is in the word. We are testing.\n\n However, I think ""SPIEL"" is a good candidate: \n   It has E at position 4 (which is not 5) and uses S, P, I, L which are common.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, L. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E at position 4? Again, same as above.\n\n How about E at position 2? \n   ""BELIE"" -> B, E, L, I, E -> but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are repeating E? And we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. It might be inefficient.\n\n   ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> E at position 2. This is good because we are testing E in a new position (2) and also testing B, L, O, W.\n\n   Also, ""BELOW"" is a common word.\n\n Let me compare:\n   ""SPIEL"": tests E at position 4 and also S, P, I, L.\n   ""BELOW"": tests E at position 2 and also B, L, O, W.\n\n We don\'t know which position E is in. So either is fine.\n\n But note: we have only 5 letters to work with. We want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n ""BELOW"" uses B, E, L, O, W. \n ""SPIEL"" uses S, P, I, E, L. \n\n Both are good. I\'ll choose ""BELOW"" because it tests E in the second position and we get to test B, L, O, W.\n\n But wait: we also want to test more common consonants. The letters in ""SPIEL"" (S, P, I, E, L) are all fairly common. The letters in ""BELOW"" (B, E, L, O, W) are also common.\n\n However, we have already eliminated C, R, A, N. So we have to avoid those.\n\n I think ""BELOW"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has B, L, O, W. We are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TEPID"": T, E, P, I, D -> E at position 2. This tests T, E, P, I, D.\n\n I think ""TEPID"" is also a good choice because it tests T and P and I and D.\n\n However, we don\'t have a strong reason to prefer one over the other.\n\n Let me choose ""TEPID"" because it has T and D which are very common.\n\n But note: we are also testing P and I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> but E is at the end? Position 5. We know E is not at 5, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""STOIC"": but C is forbidden? So no.\n\n How about ""STOLE"" is not good because of the end position.\n\n Another word: ""SETUP"" -> S, E, T, U, P -> E at position 2. This avoids C, R, A, N.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, T, U, P.\n\n I think ""SETUP"" is a good word? But it\'s less common.\n\n Let me stick with a more common word: ""BELOW"" or ""TEPID"".\n\n I\'ll go with ""TEPID"" because it tests T, E, P, I, D. And E is at position 2.\n\n But note: we are testing E at position 2. If we get a ✓ for E, then we know it\'s at position 2. If we get a \'-\', then we know E is in the word but not at 2 (so it must be at 1,3, or 4). If we get an \'x\' for E? But we know E is in the word, so we shouldn\'t get an \'x\'. We will get either ✓ or -.\n\n So let\'s choose ""TEPID"".\n\n But wait: we are also testing T, E, P, I, D. This will give us information about these letters.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has E and also includes other vowels? We know A is out, so we can test O and I.\n\n ""TEPID"" has I and no O? \n\n Another word: ""OPINE"" -> O, P, I, N, E -> but N is forbidden! So we cannot use N.\n\n How about ""OILED"": O, I, L, E, D -> E at position 4? That\'s not 5. So that\'s acceptable. But we are repeating the end? Actually, position 4 is not the end? But we are testing E at 4.\n\n However, I think ""TEPID"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we are not using S, which is a very common letter. So maybe we should include S.\n\n How about ""ESTOP""? Not a common word.\n\n How about ""SETUP""? As I thought earlier.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPIEL"" is a valid word and includes S and P which are common.\n\n I think I\'ll go with ""SPIEL"" because it has S and P and we can get information about S and P.\n\n So my second guess: ""SPIEL""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 4. If E is actually at position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3.\n\n Also, we test S, P, I, L.\n\n So let\'s do ""SPIEL"".\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A, N** are **absent** from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **E** is **present** but **not in position 5** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **E** (since it\'s confirmed present) but **not in position 5**.\n- Avoid **C, R, A, N** entirely.\n- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., **S, T, L, I, O, P**) to maximize information.\n\nThe word **""SPIEL""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **E** in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Uses new common letters: **S, P, I, L**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help locate **E** and test four additional letters.\n\n<guess>spiel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""spiel"" -> S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)\nMeaning:\n- S is in the word but not in position 1 (since we placed it at position 1 and got ""-"").\n- P is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since we placed it at position 3 and got ""-"").\n- E is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 4 (since in ""spiel"", E is the 4th letter). So the secret word has E as the 4th letter.\n- L is not in the word (x).\n\nSo, from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The 4th letter is E.\n2. The word contains E and also S and I, but not in the positions we tried.\n3. The following letters are absent: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know E is not at position 5, which is consistent because now we know E is at position 4.\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe know the word contains S and I, but not in positions 1, 3 (from ""spiel"") and not in the positions we didn\'t try? Actually, we only know that in ""spiel"", S was at position 1 and I at position 3, and they are not there. But they could be in other positions.\n\nSpecifically:\n- S is in the word but not at position 1.\n- I is in the word but not at position 3.\n\nAlso, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I, L. So we should avoid these except E, S, I which are present.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Has E as the 4th letter.\n- Contains S and I (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nAdditionally, we must avoid the positions we know are wrong for S and I.\n\nSo, the word must be of the form: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe know S cannot be at position 1, and I cannot be at position 3.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to account for: the word has 5 letters, and we know E, S, I are present (along with two other letters that we don\'t know yet).\n\nWe have to choose a word that tests possible positions for S and I and also introduces two new letters.\n\nWe should avoid positions that we have already ruled out for S and I.\n\nLet me list the possible positions for S: it cannot be at position 1. So it can be at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at position 3, so it can be at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut note: the word has exactly 5 letters, and we know 3: E at 4, S somewhere, and I somewhere. So we need two more letters.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nWe can consider common letters that are still available. We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we should focus on common ones.\n\nWe need to form a word that has E at position 4, and includes S and I in positions that are allowed.\n\nLet me think of words that end with E at the 4th position.\n\nThe pattern: ???.?E? -> with the last letter being the 5th.\n\nWe know S and I must be in the first three positions, but not in the positions we tried.\n\nWe can try to put S in position 2 and I in position 1? Or S in position 3 and I in position 2, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know the exact positions.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nLet me try to list possible words.\n\nFor example:\n- If we put I at position 1: then the word starts with I. Then S could be at position 2, 3, or 5.\n- Similarly, if we put S at position 2, then I can be at 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3? Actually, I cannot be at position 3? Wait, from ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. So I can be at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the positions we know are wrong for S: S cannot be at 1.\n\nSo let\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: I at position 1, S at position 2: then the word is I S ? E ? \nBut we need a valid word. Is there any? For example, ""ISLE"" but L is forbidden. ""ISSUE"" has two S\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.\n\nAnother: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.\n\n""ISSUE"" has S at 1 and 4? But position 4 is E, so not. So not.\n\nOption 2: I at position 1, S at position 3: then I _ S E _\nBut we need a letter for position 2 and 5. And the word must be valid.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> but C is forbidden. ""ITCHY"" has C? No, C is forbidden? Actually, we cannot use C. So no.\n\nAnother: ""IMPEL"" -> but P is forbidden? P was in ""spiel"" and got x, so P is absent. So we cannot use P.\n\nWe must avoid P.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE""? But U and B? But we don\'t know. Also, E is at 4? ""IMBUE"" is I-M-B-U-E -> positions: 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need E at position 4.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ _ E _\n\nWith I and S in the first three positions, and not in the positions we know they are not.\n\nLet me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?\n\nWhat can fill position 3 and 5? We need a word.\n\nPossible: ""ISOLE"" -> but L is forbidden and O? But ""ISOLE"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be, but let\'s think of common words.\n\nAnother: ""ISSUE"" -> but S at 1 and 4? We need position 4 to be E, so not. And also, ""ISSUE"" has two S\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid L.\n\n""ISLET"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""ISMEL"" -> not a word.\n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> but R is forbidden? R was in ""crane"" and got x, so R is absent. So no.\n\n""IDLES"" -> but L and S at the end? But we have E at 4? ""IDLES"" is I-D-L-E-S -> positions: 1:I, 2:D, 3:L, 4:E, 5:S -> but L is forbidden and S is at 5? But we can try? However, L is absent, so we cannot use L.\n\nWe must avoid L.\n\nAnother: ""IMBUE"" -> E is at 4? I-M-B-U-E -> 1:I, 2:M, 3:B, 4:U, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need the 4th to be E, so the word must end with E? No, the 4th is E, then the 5th is something.\n\nSo pattern: ...E? -> so the last letter is not E, because E is at 4.\n\nSo the word ends with a letter at position 5.\n\nSo: _ _ _ E X, where X is the 5th letter.\n\nWe know S and I must be in the first three.\n\nLet me try to put S at position 2 and I at position 1: then I S ? E ?\n\nWe need a word: I S ? E ?\n\nPossible: ""ISLET"" -> but L is forbidden.\n\n""ISSUE"" -> not, because of L and also duplicate S? But we don\'t know.\n\nAnother: ""ISOME"" -> not a common word.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> L forbidden and not ending with E.\n\nWe need to end with E at 4.\n\nSo: I ? S E ?\n\nWhat words? ""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden.\n\n""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden.\n\n""IMMIX"" -> not ending with E.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nPut S at position 2 and I at position 3? But wait, we know I cannot be at position 3? From ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. So we cannot put I at 3.\n\nSo I cannot be at 3.\n\nTherefore, for I, we can only put it at 1, 2, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, for S, we can only put it at 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).\n\nSo let\'s try S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""OSIER"" -> but R is forbidden.\n\n""ASIDE"" -> A and E? But A is forbidden.\n\n""USHER"" -> R and H? R forbidden.\n\n""MSIZE"" -> not a word.\n\n""SHIRE"" -> R forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 2: then _ I S E ?\n\nExample: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""WISE"" -> but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n""WISER"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""MINCE"" -> C and N forbidden.\n\n""DISCO"" -> not ending with E.\n\nWe need to end with E at 4.\n\nSo: _ I S E ?\n\nWhat words? ""BISER"" -> not a word and R forbidden.\n\n""VISIT"" -> but E at 4? V-I-S-I-T -> positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:I, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not I. So no.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\nSo: _ I S E ? -> but that would be _ I S E X.\n\nBut we have to have E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.\n\nSo the pattern: position 1: ?, 2: I, 3: S, 4: E, 5: ?\n\nBut we don\'t know if we can put S at 3 and I at 2.\n\nIs that a word? ""ISEX"" is not a common word.\n\n""DISCO"" is not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that S might be at position 5.\n\nSo let\'s try S at position 5 and I at position 2: then _ I ? E S\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""TIMES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""BITES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""DIKES"" -> K and E? But E is at 4, so ""DIKES"" is D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to check if D and K are allowed? We haven\'t used them and they are not forbidden. Also, we avoid C, R, A, N, P, L.\n\nSo ""DIKES"" is a valid word? Yes, ""dikes"" is plural of dike.\n\nBut note: we are putting I at position 2 and S at position 5. Also, we are testing D and K.\n\nBut we also know that I cannot be at position 3? Actually, in ""spiel"", I was at position 3 and got \'-\', so I is not at 3. But in ""dikes"", I is at 2, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, S is at 5, which is allowed (since we only know it\'s not at 1).\n\nBut we have to consider: in ""dikes"", we have I at 2 and S at 5. Also, E at 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if I can be at 2. We are testing.\n\nAnother possibility: S at position 3 and I at position 5: then _ _ S E I\n\nExample: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""POSSE"" -> P and S? P is forbidden.\n\n""BESIE"" -> B, E, S, I, E -> but E is at 2 and 5? We know E is at 4, but we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we are repeating E? And we have E at 4 already. But if we put E at 2 and 5, we might get information about duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""BESIE"" is B-E-S-I-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:S, 4:I, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5? Actually, position 4 is I? So not.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\nSo: _ _ S E I -> that would be ... S E I? But we need E at 4, so the third letter is S, fourth is E, fifth is I.\n\nSo the word: ? ? S E I\n\nExample: ""TOSIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""POSIE"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""BASIE"" -> A forbidden.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nAnother idea: put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then _ S ? E I\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.\n\n""ASKED"" -> A and K? A is forbidden.\n\n""EXIST"" -> X and T? But E is at 1? We need E at 4. ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:S, 5:T -> but we need E at 4, not S. So no.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nSo: _ S ? E I\n\nWhat words? ""OSEBI"" -> not a word.\n\n""ISLEI"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have the S and I in positions we haven\'t tried.\n\nFor example, put I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> not.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother idea: we know E is at 4, so we can try to use a word that has E at 4, and tests S and I in new positions.\n\nBut we also need to test new letters.\n\nWe have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me list the available letters: we can use B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a word: ? ? ? E ?\n\nWith S and I in the first three, but not at the positions we know they are not.\n\nSo let\'s try:\n\n- Position 1: can be I? Or a new letter? But we know I is in the word, so we can put I at 1? But we haven\'t tried that.\n\nWe can try I at position 1.\n\nThen the word: I ? ? E ?\n\nBut we also need S somewhere.\n\nSo I at 1, S at 2? Then I S ? E ?\n\nBut we need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWe can try ""ISELE"" -> not a word.\n\n""ISIDE"" -> not a word.\n\n""IMBUE"" -> not.\n\nHow about ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\nI think we should consider putting S at position 3 and I at position 2: then ? I S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 5.\n\nExample: ""TISEL"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""WISER"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""BASIS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""MINCE"" -> N and C forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: put S at position 5 and I at position 2: then ? I ? E S\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""DIKES"" as I thought earlier: D-I-K-E-S -> 1:D, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a valid word.\n\nIn ""DIKES"", we have:\n- Position 1: D (new)\n- Position 2: I (we know I is in the word, but we are testing if it\'s at 2)\n- Position 3: K (new)\n- Position 4: E (known)\n- Position 5: S (we know S is in the word, testing if it\'s at 5)\n\nThis seems like a good candidate.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing D and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""TILES"" but L is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""BICES"" -> but C is forbidden.\n\n""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And E at 4. But we have two S\'s? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are repeating S? But we know S is in the word, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is a word (plural of vise).\n\nBut let\'s see: positions: 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 3 and 5. We know S is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, we are testing.\n\nBut we are also testing V and I (but I we know is present).\n\nBut we are using two S\'s? We might get confused if the word has one S or two.\n\nSimilarly, ""VISES"" uses V, I, S, E, S.\n\nBut we are avoiding forbidden letters? V is not forbidden, I is allowed, S is allowed, E is fixed, and S is allowed.\n\nBut we are repeating S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""FICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""MIKES"" -> M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" is also a word.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut ""DIKES"" uses D and K, while ""MIKES"" uses M and K.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we are testing the position of S and I.\n\nIn ""DIKES"":\n- I at position 2: we are testing if I is at 2.\n- S at position 5: testing if S is at 5.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5 (but we are testing 2).\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nBut we are also testing D and K.\n\nAnother candidate: put S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> no.\n\n""IVORY"" -> no.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> no.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> no.\n\nI think ""DIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""TOISE"" -> not a word.\n\n""BIKES"" -> B-I-K-E-S -> 1:B, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" and ""BIKES"" are both valid.\n\nBut ""BIKES"" uses B and K, while ""DIKES"" uses D and K.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""HOMES"" -> but E is at 4? H-O-M-E-S -> 1:H, 2:O, 3:M, 4:E, 5:S -> this is a word. And it uses H, O, M.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H, O, M.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:S -> valid.\n\nBut we don\'t know about T, O, W.\n\nBut we are testing multiple new letters.\n\nIn ""HOMES"", we test H, O, M.\n\nIn ""TOWES"", we test T, O, W.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut we also have to consider the positions for S and I.\n\nIn ""HOMES"", we are putting S at 5 and I is missing? But we know I must be in the word, so we must include I.\n\nWe must include I and S.\n\nSo ""HOMES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include I and S.\n\nSo the word must contain I and S.\n\nSo ""DIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\n""BIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\n""HOMES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""MIKES"" has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> but S at 3 and 5? And we have two S\'s. But we know S is in the word, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is not common.\n\n""BIKES"" is a common word.\n\nBut let me check: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. ""BIKES"" uses B, I, K, E, S. I and S are known, E is fixed. B and K are new. And no forbidden letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" uses D, I, K, E, S.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we also want to test if S is at the end. If we put S at 5, and if it\'s correct, then we know S is at 5. If not, then S must be at 2 or 3.\n\nSimilarly for I at 2.\n\nIn ""DIKES"", we are testing:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: I (we know I is present, but is it at 2? We don\'t know)\n- Position 3: K\n- Position 4: E (known)\n- Position 5: S (testing if S is at 5)\n\nIf we get a ✓ for I at 2, then we know I is at 2. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nBut we are also testing D and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: then ? S ? E I\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 3.\n\nExample: ""USQUE"" -> not a word.\n\n""ASKED"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""EXIST"" -> E at 1, but we need E at 4.\n\n""OSIER"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""ASIDE"" -> A forbidden.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nPut S at position 3 and I at position 1: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> P forbidden.\n\n""IVORY"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> not.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> not.\n\nI think we should go with ""DIKES"" or ""BIKES"".\n\nLet me choose ""BIKES"": B-I-K-E-S\n\nBut in ""BIKES"", we are putting I at 2 and S at 5.\n\nWe know that in the secret word, E is at 4, and we know S and I are present.\n\nIf we get feedback that I is at 2, then we know. If not, then I is at 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for S at 5.\n\nAlso, we test B and K.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have S at 2 and I at 5? But we couldn\'t find a word for that.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWES"" -> T-O-W-E-S -> but no I.\n\nWe must include I.\n\n""MIKES"" is a word: M-I-K-E-S -> 1:M, 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""DIKES"" is also common.\n\nBut let me check the dictionary: both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BIKES"" to use B instead of D.\n\nSo guess: ""BIKES""\n\nBut note: we are putting S at 5. We know E is at 4, and we know S is present, so if S is at 5, we get a ✓, else if it\'s at 2 or 3, we get a \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for I at 2.\n\nBut we are also testing B and K.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has S at 2 and I at 1? But we couldn\'t find a word.\n\nAnother word: ""SIEVE"" -> but E is at 5? We need E at 4. ""SIEVE"" is S-I-E-V-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:V, 5:E -> but we need E at 4, not at 5. So no.\n\nWe must have E at 4.\n\nSo I think ""BIKES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with S at 2 and I at 5.\n\nFor example, ""SIXES"" -> but X and S? ""SIXES"" is S-I-X-E-S -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:X, 4:E, 5:S -> but we are putting S at 1 and 5? But we know S is not at 1 (from ""spiel"" feedback: S at 1 was \'-\', so not at 1). So we cannot put S at 1.\n\nIn ""SIXES"", S is at 1, which is forbidden. So we cannot use that.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put S at 1.\n\nSo S must be at 2, 3, or 5.\n\nBut if we put S at 5, then we can test that.\n\nSimilarly, I at 1,2, or 5.\n\nBut if we put I at 5, then we have: _ _ _ E I\n\nAnd we need S in 2,3, or 5? But position 5 is I, so S must be at 2 or 3.\n\nExample: ""TOWIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""TOISE"" -> not.\n\n""BIKES"" has S at 5 and I at 2.\n\nAnother word: ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""FICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""VISES"" -> V-I-S-E-S -> 1:V, 2:I, 3:S, 4:E, 5:S -> this has I at 2 and S at 3 and 5. But we are repeating S? And we know S is present, so we can test.\n\nBut ""VISES"" is not common.\n\n""BIKES"" is better.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- B at 1: we don\'t know.\n- I at 2: we are testing if I is at 2.\n- K at 3: new letter.\n- E at 4: known.\n- S at 5: testing if S is at 5.\n\nIf we get:\n- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.\n- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.\n\nIf not, we get \'-\' for I and S, meaning they are in the word but not at these positions.\n\nAlso, we test B and K.\n\nSo let\'s do ""BIKES"".\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has B or K.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWES"" doesn\'t have I.\n\n""MIKES"" is similar to ""BIKES"" but with M instead of B.\n\nI think ""BIKES"" is fine.\n\nBut let me think of a word that has I at position 1 and S at position 3: then I ? S E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 2 and 5.\n\nExample: ""ITCHY"" -> no.\n\n""IMPEL"" -> no.\n\n""IVORY"" -> no.\n\n""IDYLL"" -> no.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE"" -> no.\n\nI think it\'s hard.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIKES"".\n\nBut wait, we have another option: we can try to put S at position 2 and I at position 5: but we need a word.\n\nWhat about ""DICES"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""BIKES"" seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""TILES"" -> L forbidden.\n\n""BIKES"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are putting I at 2 and S at 5. We know that if I is at 2, we get ✓, else if I is at 1, we get \'-\' for I at 2? Actually, if I is at 1, then in ""BIKES"", I is at 2, which is not the correct position, so we get \'-\' for I at 2. And S at 5: if S is at 5, we get ✓, else if S is at 2 or 3, we get \'-\'.\n\nBut we are testing.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I at 1 and S at 2? But we don\'t have a word.\n\nOr S at 3 and I at 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word for that.\n\nAnother word: ""SIEGE"" -> but E at 5? We need E at 4.\n\n""SIEGE"" is S-I-E-G-E -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:E, 4:G, 5:E -> not.\n\nI think we should go with ""BIKES"".\n\nSo my guess is ""BIKES"".\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have.\n\nWe know:\n- E at 4: fixed.\n- S is present, not at 1.\n- I is present, not at 3.\n\nIn ""BIKES"", we have:\n- B at 1: new\n- I at 2: testing if I is at 2\n- K at 3: new\n- E at 4: known\n- S at 5: testing if S is at 5\n\nIf we get:\n- If I is at 2, we get ✓ for I at 2.\n- If S is at 5, we get ✓ for S at 5.\n\nIf not, we get \'-\' for I and S, meaning they are elsewhere.\n\nAlso, we get information about B and K.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""BIKES"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  \n  - C, R, A, N are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: spiel** → S(-), P(x), I(-), E(✓), L(x)  \n  - E is confirmed at position 4.  \n  - S is present but not at position 1.  \n  - I is present but not at position 3.  \n  - P and L are absent.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **E is fixed at position 4**: The secret word pattern is `_ _ _ E _`.  \n- **Present letters**: E, S, I (S cannot be at position 1, I cannot be at position 3).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, P, L.  \n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 need to be solved, with S and I placed in valid positions (S: positions 2, 3, or 5; I: positions 1, 2, or 5).  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Test possible positions for S and I while introducing new common letters (e.g., B, K, T, O) to gather more information.  \n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, A, N, P, L).  \n- Prioritize words that:  \n  - Place E at position 4 (fixed).  \n  - Include S and I in positions not ruled out (S not at 1, I not at 3).  \n  - Use high-frequency letters like B, K, T to maximize information gain.  \n\n### Chosen Guess: ""BIKES""\n- **B** (position 1): New letter, tests if B is in the word.  \n- **I** (position 2): Tests if I is at position 2 (if not, I must be at 1 or 5).  \n- **K** (position 3): New letter, tests K\'s presence.  \n- **E** (position 4): Confirmed correct position.  \n- **S** (position 5): Tests if S is at position 5 (if not, S must be at 2 or 3).  \n\nThis guess efficiently tests the positions of S and I while checking two new letters (B and K).

We haven\'t used D.\n- ""MIKES"" - M is not forbidden.\n- ""VIKES"" - V is not forbidden.\n- ""TIKES"" - not a common word? Maybe not valid.\n- ""HIKES"" - H is not forbidden.\n- ""YIKES"" - Y is not forbidden, but it\'s informal? Maybe not ideal.\n\nBut we need to check if they are valid words.\n\nActually, ""DIKES"", ""MIKES"", ""HIKES"", ""VIKES"", etc.\n\nBut note: in guess 3, we used ""bikes"" and got B wrong, but we have the correct IKES part.\n\nNow, we know that the first letter is not B, and not the forbidden ones.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nBut we also have to consider that in the first guess, we had E as present but not at 5, which is consistent.\n\nNow, which one to pick? We can try ""DIKES"" because D is a common letter.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we have only one position left, so we can guess one of the possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can try one.\n\nBut we can also think: is there a word that uses more new letters? But we only have one position, so it\'s straightforward.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me list the possibilities without forbidden letters:\n- D: ""DIKES""\n- M: ""MIKES""\n- H: ""HIKES""\n- V: ""VIKES""\n- F: ""FIKES"" - not a common word? (Fikes? Not sure)\n- G: ""GIKES"" - not a word\n- J: ""JIKES"" - not a word\n- O: ""OIKES"" - not a word\n- Q: ""QUIKES"" - not 5 letters? ""Quikes"" is not standard.\n- T: ""TIKES"" - not a common word? (Tikes? Maybe as a name)\n- U: ""UIKES"" - not a word\n- W: ""WIKES"" - not a word\n- X: ""IXNES"" - not, and X is not common here.\n- Y: ""YIKES"" - informal, might not be accepted. But let\'s see: in word games, ""yikes"" is sometimes accepted as an interjection. However, we should stick to common words.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""DIKES"" (plural of dike)\n- ""MIKES"" (not a common word? But ""mike"" is a name, but ""mikes"" might be plural? Actually, ""mikes"" is acceptable in some word lists)\n- ""HIKES"" (hikes, plural of hike)\n- ""VIKES"" (not common; vikes might refer to Vikings, but not general term)\n\nThe most common words are ""DIKES"" and ""HIKES"".\n\nWe can try ""DIKES"" first.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the word list.\n\nSince we are playing by the rules, ""DIKES"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""HIKES"" is valid.\n\nBut we have two options. We can choose one.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: in the first guess, we had E as present, and now we have E at 4, which is consistent.\n\nBut we don\'t have any other constraints.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not used D, H, M, etc.\n\nBut we have to guess one.\n\nLet me pick ""DIKES"".\n\nBut wait: in guess 2, we had ""spiel"" which had S at 1 and I at 3, both wrong positions. Now in ""DIKES"", we have:\n- D at 1: new\n- I at 2: we know is correct (from guess 3, I is ✓ at 2)\n- K at 3: we know is correct (from guess 3, K is ✓ at 3)\n- E at 4: correct\n- S at 5: we know is correct (from guess 3, S is ✓ at 5)\n\nSo if we guess ""DIKES"", we are only testing D at position 1.\n\nIf D is correct, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -? But D is at position 1, so if D is not in the word, we get x. If D is in the word but not at 1, we get -.\n\nBut we know the word is ?IKES, so the only unknown is the first letter.\n\nSo by guessing ""DIKES"", we can confirm if D is the first letter.\n\nSimilarly, we could guess ""HIKES"" to test H.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nSince we have multiple guesses left, we can pick one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""DIKES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tried to cover more ground? But in this case, we are only testing one letter.\n\nHowever, we have 3 guesses left (since we used 3, and this is the fourth).\n\nBut we can also consider: we know the word is ?IKES. We can try ""DIKES"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try another.\n\nBut we can also think: is there a word that has more than one new letter? But we only have one position.\n\nSo I think ""DIKES"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""DIKES"".\n\nBut note: we must avoid the forbidden letters. D is not forbidden.\n\nSo <guess>dikes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:\n\n- **E** is confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2 and 3).\n- **I** is confirmed at position 2 (from Guess 3).\n- **K** is confirmed at position 3 (from Guess 3).\n- **S** is confirmed at position 5 (from Guess 3).\n- **E** is not at position 5 (from Guess 1), which is consistent with the current E position.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ I K E S`. Only position 1 is unknown.\n\n**Absent letters**: C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), P, L (from Guess 2), and B (from Guess 3). So absent: **C, R, A, N, P, L, B**.\n\n**Possible words**: The word must be a valid 5-letter word ending in ""IKES"". Common options include:\n- **DIKES** (plural of ""dike"")\n- **HIKES** (plural of ""hike"")\n- **MIKES** (less common, but possible; may refer to ""mike"" as a name)\n- **VIKES** (variant of ""vike"", not commonly used)\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- Only position 1 is unknown. We need to test the first letter using a valid word.\n- **DIKES** is a common word and tests the letter **D**. If incorrect, we eliminate D and try another candidate (e.g., HIKES or MIKES) in subsequent guesses.\n\nGiven that, we guess **DIKES** to efficiently confirm or rule out D.\n\n<guess>dikes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: spiel -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) I(-) E(✓) L(x)\nGuess 3: bikes -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\nGuess 4: dikes -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from Guess 4: ""dikes"" -> D(x) I(✓) K(✓) E(✓) S(✓)
This tells us that:
- D is not in the word (x).
- I, K, E, S are all in the correct positions (✓). Specifically:
  - I at position 2: ✓ (already known from Guess 3)
  - K at position 3: ✓ (already known from Guess 3)
  - E at position 4: ✓ (already known)
  - S at position 5: ✓ (already known)

So the feedback confirms that the word is ? I K E S, with the first letter unknown.

From the feedback, D is absent, so the first letter cannot be D.

Previously, we had a list of forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, P, L, B, D.

Now we add D to that list.

So forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, P, L, B, D.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form X I K E S, where X is a letter not in the forbidden set.

Possible letters: F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, common words ending with ""IKES"":
- HIKES: ""hikes"" (meaning: to walk or travel on foot)
- MIKES: ""mikes"" (informal for microphone? or as a name)
- VIKES: ""vikes"" (variant of vixen? not commonly used)
- TIKES: not a standard word.
- WIKES: not a word.
- FIKES: not a word.
- YIKES: informal, but might be accepted as an interjection.

The most common words are ""hikes"" and ""mikes"".

We have to choose between these.

We can try ""hikes"".

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. H is not forbidden.

Similarly, M is not forbidden.

We can try ""hikes"".

If it's not, then we try ""mikes"".

But we have two options.

Alternatively, we can think: in the first guess, we had E as present (but not at position 5), which is consistent with E being at 4.

Now, we know the word is either ""hikes"" or ""mikes"".

We can guess one of them.

Since ""hikes"" is more common, we try that.

But let's see: we have 6 tries, and this is the fifth guess. We can try ""hikes"".

If it's wrong, then we know it must be ""mikes"".

But we can also consider: are there other possibilities? Like ""wikes""? Unlikely.

Or ""jikes""? Not a word.

So likely between ""hikes"" and ""mikes"".

We can try ""hikes"".

So the guess is ""hikes"".

But note: we are not sure if the word is common or not. However, ""hikes"" is a common word.

Therefore, we guess ""hikes"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have:

- **Secret word pattern**: The word must be `_ I K E S` (positions 2-5 confirmed: I, K, E, S).
- **First letter constraints**: Cannot be C, R, A, N (from Guess 1), P, L (from Guess 2), B (from Guess 3), or D (from Guess 4). So forbidden letters: **C, R, A, N, P, L, B, D**.
- **Possible words**: Only common valid words fitting `X I K E S` are:
  - **HIKES** (plural of ""hike"")
  - **MIKES** (less common, but possible; informal for ""microphone"" or surname)
- **HIKES** is the most common and practical option. H is not forbidden and is a common letter.

### Reasoning:
- The word must start with a letter not in the forbidden set (F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- ""HIKES"" tests **H** at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If incorrect, we eliminate H and try ""MIKES"" next.

Given the pattern is confirmed, this guess will either solve the puzzle or narrow it to one remaining option.
