We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N as well.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters.

 Example words: 
   ""TOILS"" - but we have to check if it uses any forbidden letters: T (allowed), O (allowed), I (allowed), L (allowed), S (allowed). 
   However, we don't know if these are in the word. We want to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. Again, all allowed.

 But note: we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's list the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C, R, A, N, E): 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has as many of these as possible.

 Consider ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> all allowed and common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also very common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid. Both ""TOILS"" and ""MOIST"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and S which we haven't tried, and it's a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

Words like ""moist"" or ""toils"" are strong candidates since they use frequent consonants (S, T, L, M) and vowels (O, I, U) not yet tested. ""Moist"" is particularly effective as it includes the common letters M, O, I, S, and T. This helps probe multiple new letters at once, increasing the chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and got a dash, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated many common letters. The remaining letters that could be in the word are:
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, and place it in a different position than the 4th.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes S (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a position that is not 4th (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5).
- Uses only the remaining letters: from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

Let's list the available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the remaining: S (we know it's in), L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also note that S is already in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position and use other common letters.

Possible positions for S: since it was in position 4 in ""moist"" and that was wrong, we can try S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have S and use other available letters.

For example:
- Position 1: S _ _ _ _
  Words: ""shuln"" (not common), ""skulk"" (but K is available), ""sulky"" (S,U,L,K,Y) -> but we don't know if U,L,K,Y are in.

But we need valid words.

Another idea: ""shards"" - but that's 6 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S and using only the available letters.

Available vowels: U (and Y as semi-vowel)

Words:
- ""sully"" - but has double L? Actually, ""sully"" is a word: S,U,L,L,Y -> but double L? The word allows double letters? The rules don't say they are unique. But in feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in our case, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Another word: ""pudgy"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> but no S. We must include S.

So words with S:

- ""spuds"" - S,P,U,D,S -> but double S? And it's a word (spuds being potato chips). But we have two S's? The feedback might handle it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

Another word: ""shuds"" - S,H,U,D,S -> again double S.

We can try ""slush"": S,L,U,S,H -> but H is available. However, ""slush"" has two S's.

We need a word without forbidden letters and with S not in the 4th position.

Let me list some words:
- S in position 1: ""skulk"" (S,K,U,L,K) -> but K is repeated? Actually, ""skulk"" has two K's. And it's valid.
- S in position 2: ""psyst"" - not a word. ""usurp"" - U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R is out). R is eliminated.

R is eliminated? From ""crane"": R(x) -> so R is not in the word. Similarly, A,N,E are out.

So forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

So R is out.

Therefore, we cannot use R.

Similarly, in ""usurp"": R is forbidden, so invalid.

Another with S in position 2: ""psalm"" - P,S,A,L,M -> but A and M are forbidden. A from ""crane"" and M from ""moist"" are out.

So not.

Position 3: S _ _ _ _

Word: ""dusky"" - D,U,S,K,Y -> but S is in the 3rd position? D (position1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). And all letters are available? 
D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.

And ""dusky"" is a valid word.

But note: we have S in the 3rd position. In ""moist"", S was in 4th and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent 3rd from being wrong? We don't know. We are trying to find the correct position.

Another word: ""pulps"" - P,U,L,P,S -> double P? And S at the end. But we have two P's. It's valid, but might be less informative.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""dusky"" uses D,U,S,K,Y. All new letters (except S which we know is in).

Similarly, we could try ""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> but double S. It might be better to avoid double letters for now.

Another word: ""lusty"" - L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from ""moist"": T(x)). T is eliminated.

So ""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""hushy"" - H,U,S,H,Y -> double H? And H is available.

But double letters might not be ideal.

""shushy"" - S,H,U,S,H,Y -> double S and H. Not good.

""blush"" - B,L,U,S,H -> S in 4th position? But we must avoid S in 4th? No, the feedback said S was in the word but wrong position when in 4th. So we can try S in 4th again? Actually, we know S is not in 4th, so we should avoid putting S in 4th to not waste a position? But we can do it if we want, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there.

Actually, the feedback told us S is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we should try S in a different position to find the correct one.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put S in either position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

In ""dusky"", S is in position 3.

Another word: ""pussy"" - P,U,S,S,Y -> double S. Not ideal.

""busky"" - not a word.

""disco"" - D,I,S,C,O -> but I and C and O are forbidden.

No.

""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> double S.

""jussi"" - not common.

""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""pudgy"" no S.

We need S.

Another idea: ""sulky"" - S,U,L,K,Y -> S in position 1. This is good because we are trying S in a new position (position 1). And it uses U,L,K,Y which are new.

""sulky"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""dusky"" is also valid.

But ""dusky"" has S in position 3, and ""sulky"" has S in position 1.

We can also consider S in position 5.

For example: ""_ _ _ _ S"" -> but we have to use available letters.

Word: ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> but O and C are forbidden.

Not.

""bass"" is 4 letters.

""lupus"" - L,U,P,U,S -> double U? And S at the end. But U is available. However, ""lupus"" is a word. But it has two U's.

We can try ""sulky"" or ""dusky"".

Let me choose ""sulky"" because it places S at the start, which is a common position.

So guess: ""sulky""

But note: we are testing S in position 1. If we get a check for S, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then we know S is not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

Also, we are testing U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""sulky"".

But wait, we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn't use any forbidden letters.

""Sulky"" uses S,U,L,K,Y. 
- S: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
- U, L, K, Y: none of these have been tested yet, and they are not forbidden.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try S in position 5. For example, ""fuses"" -> F,U,S,E,S -> but E is forbidden (from ""crane""). E is out.

""jums"" - J,U,M,S -> M is forbidden (from ""moist"": M(x)).

Not.

""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> M is forbidden.

Not.

So ""sulky"" seems a good choice.

Another option: ""dusky"" has S in position 3.

But ""sulky"" has S in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""shuln"" but that's not common.

Or ""skulk"" - S,K,U,L,K -> double K? But it's valid. S in position 1? Actually, ""skulk"" is S,K,U,L,K -> positions: S1, K2, U3, L4, K5. But K is repeated. It might be acceptable, but we lose information on one position.

""sulky"" is better because all letters are distinct.

So I'll go with ""sulky"".

<guess>sulky</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x), meaning:
  - S is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.
  - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **S is in the secret word**, but not in position 4.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word cannot contain any of these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 4.
  - Use new, common letters from the available set to maximize information (e.g., L, U, K, Y).
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to test more possibilities.
  - Good candidate: **""sulky""** (S in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4, Y in 5). This tests S in a new position (1) and introduces four new common letters (U, L, K, Y).

<guess>sulky</guess>",sulky,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and got a dash, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated many common letters. The remaining letters that could be in the word are:
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, and place it in a different position than the 4th.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes S (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a position that is not 4th (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5).
- Uses only the remaining letters: from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

Let's list the available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the remaining: S (we know it's in), L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also note that S is already in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position and use other common letters.

Possible positions for S: since it was in position 4 in ""moist"" and that was wrong, we can try S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have S and use other available letters.

For example:
- Position 1: S _ _ _ _
  Words: ""shuln"" (not common), ""skulk"" (but K is available), ""sulky"" (S,U,L,K,Y) -> but we don't know if U,L,K,Y are in.

But we need valid words.

Another idea: ""shards"" - but that's 6 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S and using only the available letters.

Available vowels: U (and Y as semi-vowel)

Words:
- ""sully"" - but has double L? Actually, ""sully"" is a word: S,U,L,L,Y -> but double L? The word allows double letters? The rules don't say they are unique. But in feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in our case, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Another word: ""pudgy"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> but no S. We must include S.

So words with S:

- ""spuds"" - S,P,U,D,S -> but double S? And it's a word (spuds being potato chips). But we have two S's? The feedback might handle it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

Another word: ""shuds"" - S,H,U,D,S -> again double S.

We can try ""slush"": S,L,U,S,H -> but H is available. However, ""slush"" has two S's.

We need a word without forbidden letters and with S not in the 4th position.

Let me list some words:
- S in position 1: ""skulk"" (S,K,U,L,K) -> but K is repeated? Actually, ""skulk"" has two K's. And it's valid.
- S in position 2: ""psyst"" - not a word. ""usurp"" - U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R is out). R is eliminated.

R is eliminated? From ""crane"": R(x) -> so R is not in the word. Similarly, A,N,E are out.

So forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

So R is out.

Therefore, we cannot use R.

Similarly, in ""usurp"": R is forbidden, so invalid.

Another with S in position 2: ""psalm"" - P,S,A,L,M -> but A and M are forbidden. A from ""crane"" and M from ""moist"" are out.

So not.

Position 3: S _ _ _ _

Word: ""dusky"" - D,U,S,K,Y -> but S is in the 3rd position? D (position1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). And all letters are available? 
D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.

And ""dusky"" is a valid word.

But note: we have S in the 3rd position. In ""moist"", S was in 4th and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent 3rd from being wrong? We don't know. We are trying to find the correct position.

Another word: ""pulps"" - P,U,L,P,S -> double P? And S at the end. But we have two P's. It's valid, but might be less informative.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""dusky"" uses D,U,S,K,Y. All new letters (except S which we know is in).

Similarly, we could try ""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> but double S. It might be better to avoid double letters for now.

Another word: ""lusty"" - L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from ""moist"": T(x)). T is eliminated.

So ""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""hushy"" - H,U,S,H,Y -> double H? And H is available.

But double letters might not be ideal.

""shushy"" - S,H,U,S,H,Y -> double S and H. Not good.

""blush"" - B,L,U,S,H -> S in 4th position? But we must avoid S in 4th? No, the feedback said S was in the word but wrong position when in 4th. So we can try S in 4th again? Actually, we know S is not in 4th, so we should avoid putting S in 4th to not waste a position? But we can do it if we want, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there.

Actually, the feedback told us S is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we should try S in a different position to find the correct one.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put S in either position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

In ""dusky"", S is in position 3.

Another word: ""pussy"" - P,U,S,S,Y -> double S. Not ideal.

""busky"" - not a word.

""disco"" - D,I,S,C,O -> but I and C and O are forbidden.

No.

""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> double S.

""jussi"" - not common.

""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""pudgy"" no S.

We need S.

Another idea: ""sulky"" - S,U,L,K,Y -> S in position 1. This is good because we are trying S in a new position (position 1). And it uses U,L,K,Y which are new.

""sulky"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""dusky"" is also valid.

But ""dusky"" has S in position 3, and ""sulky"" has S in position 1.

We can also consider S in position 5.

For example: ""_ _ _ _ S"" -> but we have to use available letters.

Word: ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> but O and C are forbidden.

Not.

""bass"" is 4 letters.

""lupus"" - L,U,P,U,S -> double U? And S at the end. But U is available. However, ""lupus"" is a word. But it has two U's.

We can try ""sulky"" or ""dusky"".

Let me choose ""sulky"" because it places S at the start, which is a common position.

So guess: ""sulky""

But note: we are testing S in position 1. If we get a check for S, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then we know S is not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

Also, we are testing U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""sulky"".

But wait, we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn't use any forbidden letters.

""Sulky"" uses S,U,L,K,Y. 
- S: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
- U, L, K, Y: none of these have been tested yet, and they are not forbidden.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try S in position 5. For example, ""fuses"" -> F,U,S,E,S -> but E is forbidden (from ""crane""). E is out.

""jums"" - J,U,M,S -> M is forbidden (from ""moist"": M(x)).

Not.

""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> M is forbidden.

Not.

So ""sulky"" seems a good choice.

Another option: ""dusky"" has S in position 3.

But ""sulky"" has S in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""shuln"" but that's not common.

Or ""skulk"" - S,K,U,L,K -> double K? But it's valid. S in position 1? Actually, ""skulk"" is S,K,U,L,K -> positions: S1, K2, U3, L4, K5. But K is repeated. It might be acceptable, but we lose information on one position.

""sulky"" is better because all letters are distinct.

So I'll go with ""sulky"".

<guess>sulky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x), meaning:
  - S is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.
  - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N as well.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters.

 Example words: 
   ""TOILS"" - but we have to check if it uses any forbidden letters: T (allowed), O (allowed), I (allowed), L (allowed), S (allowed). 
   However, we don't know if these are in the word. We want to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. Again, all allowed.

 But note: we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's list the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C, R, A, N, E): 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has as many of these as possible.

 Consider ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> all allowed and common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also very common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid. Both ""TOILS"" and ""MOIST"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and S which we haven't tried, and it's a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

Words like ""moist"" or ""toils"" are strong candidates since they use frequent consonants (S, T, L, M) and vowels (O, I, U) not yet tested. ""Moist"" is particularly effective as it includes the common letters M, O, I, S, and T. This helps probe multiple new letters at once, increasing the chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and got a dash, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated many common letters. The remaining letters that could be in the word are:
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, and place it in a different position than the 4th.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes S (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a position that is not 4th (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5).
- Uses only the remaining letters: from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

Let's list the available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the remaining: S (we know it's in), L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also note that S is already in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position and use other common letters.

Possible positions for S: since it was in position 4 in ""moist"" and that was wrong, we can try S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have S and use other available letters.

For example:
- Position 1: S _ _ _ _
  Words: ""shuln"" (not common), ""skulk"" (but K is available), ""sulky"" (S,U,L,K,Y) -> but we don't know if U,L,K,Y are in.

But we need valid words.

Another idea: ""shards"" - but that's 6 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S and using only the available letters.

Available vowels: U (and Y as semi-vowel)

Words:
- ""sully"" - but has double L? Actually, ""sully"" is a word: S,U,L,L,Y -> but double L? The word allows double letters? The rules don't say they are unique. But in feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in our case, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Another word: ""pudgy"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> but no S. We must include S.

So words with S:

- ""spuds"" - S,P,U,D,S -> but double S? And it's a word (spuds being potato chips). But we have two S's? The feedback might handle it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

Another word: ""shuds"" - S,H,U,D,S -> again double S.

We can try ""slush"": S,L,U,S,H -> but H is available. However, ""slush"" has two S's.

We need a word without forbidden letters and with S not in the 4th position.

Let me list some words:
- S in position 1: ""skulk"" (S,K,U,L,K) -> but K is repeated? Actually, ""skulk"" has two K's. And it's valid.
- S in position 2: ""psyst"" - not a word. ""usurp"" - U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R is out). R is eliminated.

R is eliminated? From ""crane"": R(x) -> so R is not in the word. Similarly, A,N,E are out.

So forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

So R is out.

Therefore, we cannot use R.

Similarly, in ""usurp"": R is forbidden, so invalid.

Another with S in position 2: ""psalm"" - P,S,A,L,M -> but A and M are forbidden. A from ""crane"" and M from ""moist"" are out.

So not.

Position 3: S _ _ _ _

Word: ""dusky"" - D,U,S,K,Y -> but S is in the 3rd position? D (position1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). And all letters are available? 
D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.

And ""dusky"" is a valid word.

But note: we have S in the 3rd position. In ""moist"", S was in 4th and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent 3rd from being wrong? We don't know. We are trying to find the correct position.

Another word: ""pulps"" - P,U,L,P,S -> double P? And S at the end. But we have two P's. It's valid, but might be less informative.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""dusky"" uses D,U,S,K,Y. All new letters (except S which we know is in).

Similarly, we could try ""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> but double S. It might be better to avoid double letters for now.

Another word: ""lusty"" - L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from ""moist"": T(x)). T is eliminated.

So ""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""hushy"" - H,U,S,H,Y -> double H? And H is available.

But double letters might not be ideal.

""shushy"" - S,H,U,S,H,Y -> double S and H. Not good.

""blush"" - B,L,U,S,H -> S in 4th position? But we must avoid S in 4th? No, the feedback said S was in the word but wrong position when in 4th. So we can try S in 4th again? Actually, we know S is not in 4th, so we should avoid putting S in 4th to not waste a position? But we can do it if we want, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there.

Actually, the feedback told us S is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we should try S in a different position to find the correct one.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put S in either position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

In ""dusky"", S is in position 3.

Another word: ""pussy"" - P,U,S,S,Y -> double S. Not ideal.

""busky"" - not a word.

""disco"" - D,I,S,C,O -> but I and C and O are forbidden.

No.

""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> double S.

""jussi"" - not common.

""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""pudgy"" no S.

We need S.

Another idea: ""sulky"" - S,U,L,K,Y -> S in position 1. This is good because we are trying S in a new position (position 1). And it uses U,L,K,Y which are new.

""sulky"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""dusky"" is also valid.

But ""dusky"" has S in position 3, and ""sulky"" has S in position 1.

We can also consider S in position 5.

For example: ""_ _ _ _ S"" -> but we have to use available letters.

Word: ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> but O and C are forbidden.

Not.

""bass"" is 4 letters.

""lupus"" - L,U,P,U,S -> double U? And S at the end. But U is available. However, ""lupus"" is a word. But it has two U's.

We can try ""sulky"" or ""dusky"".

Let me choose ""sulky"" because it places S at the start, which is a common position.

So guess: ""sulky""

But note: we are testing S in position 1. If we get a check for S, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then we know S is not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

Also, we are testing U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""sulky"".

But wait, we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn't use any forbidden letters.

""Sulky"" uses S,U,L,K,Y. 
- S: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
- U, L, K, Y: none of these have been tested yet, and they are not forbidden.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try S in position 5. For example, ""fuses"" -> F,U,S,E,S -> but E is forbidden (from ""crane""). E is out.

""jums"" - J,U,M,S -> M is forbidden (from ""moist"": M(x)).

Not.

""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> M is forbidden.

Not.

So ""sulky"" seems a good choice.

Another option: ""dusky"" has S in position 3.

But ""sulky"" has S in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""shuln"" but that's not common.

Or ""skulk"" - S,K,U,L,K -> double K? But it's valid. S in position 1? Actually, ""skulk"" is S,K,U,L,K -> positions: S1, K2, U3, L4, K5. But K is repeated. It might be acceptable, but we lose information on one position.

""sulky"" is better because all letters are distinct.

So I'll go with ""sulky"".

<guess>sulky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x), meaning:
  - S is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.
  - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **S is in the secret word**, but not in position 4.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word cannot contain any of these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 4.
  - Use new, common letters from the available set to maximize information (e.g., L, U, K, Y).
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to test more possibilities.
  - Good candidate: **""sulky""** (S in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4, Y in 5). This tests S in a new position (1) and introduces four new common letters (U, L, K, Y).

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for S in position 1), U is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, K and Y absent.

So, from ""sulky"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (we already knew it's not in position 4 from ""moist"", and now position 1 is also wrong).
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K and Y are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has U in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ U L _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 1, 4 (from ""moist"" and ""sulky""), and not in position 2 or 3 (because position 2 is U and position 3 is L, so they are fixed). So S must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,4,5 but we know it's not in 1,4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by U and L. So position 5 is the only possibility? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 left. However, from ""sulky"", S was in position 1 and was wrong, so it can't be in position 1. From ""moist"", it was in position 4 and was wrong, so not in 4. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 5 available. However, we must consider that S could be in position 5, but we haven't tested position 5 for S. Also, note that in ""sulky"", we placed S in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. We also know it's not in position 4. The only positions left are 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5? But we don't have direct evidence for position 5. We need to test.

But wait, the word has positions: 1: ?, 2: U, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

We know S is in the word and cannot be in positions 1,4 (from feedback) and positions 2 and 3 are taken. So the only position left for S is 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5.

But let's confirm: the feedback for ""sulky"" says S(-) for position 1, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about other positions. We already know from ""moist"" that S is not in position 4. And now we know position 2 and 3 are U and L, so S cannot be there. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 1 and 5. We know it's not in position 1. So yes, it must be in position 5.

But we are not 100% sure because the word might have more than one S? But we don't have evidence of that. However, we should consider that S might be in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested all positions except we haven't tested position 5 for S. And we know S is not in 1,4, and 2,3 are fixed. So position 5 is the only possibility.

But what about position 1? We know S is not in position 1, so it must be in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must end with S? But we have the pattern: _ U L _ _

So the word is ? U L ? S? But we have position 5 as S? But we don't know for sure. We need to confirm.

But let's see: we have to fill position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word and must be in one of the positions. As discussed, position 5 is the only one left because position 1 is excluded and 2,3,4 are excluded for S. So position 5 must be S.

Therefore, the word is: _ U L _ S

But we don't know the first letter.

Also, we know K and Y are not in the word.

So, the known information:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: S (we are deducing it must be there)

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters.

The word: [letter1] U L [letter4] S

We know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and they cannot be any of the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.

Also, we know S is in the word, but we are placing it in position 5.

Now, what letters are available? We have the alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, I, K, M, N, O, R, T, Y.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

But U and L are already in the word and in positions 2 and 3. We don't know if they can be repeated? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have repeated letters? But in this case, U and L are already placed, so if the word has another U or L, we don't know. But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates.

However, for the first and fourth positions, we need to choose letters from the available set.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 4.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

The pattern: [1] U L [4] S

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z.

But S is already in position 5, so if we use S again, it might be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's.

We should avoid using S in position 1 because we are trying to find the first letter, and if we use S there, it might be confusing. But we can use S in position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is before S.

But we know that S is not in position 1,4 (from previous), and 2,3 are fixed. So if we put S in position 4, that would be a new position? But we already know S is not in position 4 from ""moist"". So we cannot put S in position 4 because it would be incorrect.

Therefore, for position 4, we cannot put S because we know it's not there. So we must choose a letter that is not S and not the eliminated ones.

Similarly, for position 1, we cannot put S because we know it's not there.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the available letters, excluding S for position 1 and excluding the eliminated letters.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and S? But we cannot use S in position 1, so S is not allowed in position 1).

Similarly, for position 4: same, we cannot use S.

So we have to choose from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.

Let's think of words that end with S and have U in the second position and L in the third.

Common words: 
- ""fulus"" - but F,U,L,U,S? That would be F(1), U(2), L(3), U(4), S(5). But U is repeated? And ""fulus"" is not a common word. Also, we don't know if U can be repeated.

But let's see: we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But we need to use available letters.

Another word: ""bulus"" - B,U,L,U,S -> but again, double U. And B is available.

But is ""bulus"" a word? It might be informal for bulus? Not common.

""dulus"" - D,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""hulus"" - not a word.

""julus"" - not a word.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""xulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U. Zulus are a tribe, but might be accepted? But we have U in position 2 and 4? That would be two U's.

But we don't know if the word has two U's. We only know one U is in position 2.

We need to consider that the fourth letter might be a different letter.

What about words without double U?

For example, ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? No, it ends with S? B,U,L,B,S? Double B? And ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> positions: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But we have B repeated? And ""bulbs"" is a word.

But we have B in position 1 and 4? That's possible.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, ""dulls"" - D,U,L,L,S -> double L? But L is already in position 3. If we put L in position 4, that would be a duplicate L. But we don't know if L is duplicated.

But in ""dulls"", we have L in position 3 and 4? Actually, ""dulls"" is D,U,L,L,S -> so position 4 is L again.

But we know L is in position 3, so if we put L in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to think of words that have U in second, L in third, and S in fifth.

Let me list possible words:

- ""bulks"" - but K is eliminated (from ""moist"": K not tested? Actually, in ""moist"", we had M,O,I,T absent, but K was not tested? Wait, in ""moist"", we had S in position 4 and got a dash, but K was not present. So K is available? But in ""bulks"", we have B,U,L,K,S -> but K is in position 4? And we know K is available? But ""bulks"" has K, but we are trying to avoid K? No, K is available.

But ""bulks"" has K, which is available. However, we have to check if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not eliminated.

But in ""bulks"", the pattern is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5. But we are deducing that S should be in position 5, so this word fits the pattern.

But we have to see if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not in the eliminated list.

But we are not sure about the first letter. We are trying to find what goes in position 1 and 4.

Another word: ""dulia"" - not a word.

""fulus"" - not common.

""gulps"" - G,U,L,P,S -> pattern G1 U2 L3 P4 S5. This is a valid word. And P is available.

Similarly, ""hulks"" - H,U,L,K,S -> H1, U2, L3, K4, S5. Valid word.

""julys"" - not a word.

""pulps"" - P1 U2 L3 P4 S5 -> double P? But it's a word.

""tulips"" - but T is eliminated.

""vulns"" - not a word.

""wolves"" - but O and E are eliminated.

""xenon"" - not matching pattern.

""zilch"" - Z,I,L,C,H -> I and C are eliminated.

Not.

""bulge"" - E is eliminated.

So possible words: ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We also have to consider that we might not be sure about S in position 5. We deduced it must be there, but let's verify the feedback.

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1.

We know position 2 is U, position 3 is L, and position 5 is S? We haven't tested position 5 for S, but we have to place S somewhere. The only position left is 5.

But what if the word has S in position 5? Then position 1 and 4 are something else.

But we have to guess.

We can try one of these words to test.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have evidence.

To be safe, we can choose a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4.

For example, ""bulks"": uses B and K.

""gulps"": uses G and P.

""hulks"": uses H and K.

""pulps"": uses P and P (duplicate P).

We want to test new letters to maximize information.

So ""bulks"" tests B and K.

""gulps"" tests G and P.

""hulks"" tests H and K.

""pulps"" tests P (but duplicate, so less information).

We also have to consider that if we are wrong, we get feedback.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""fulus"" - not common.

""dulus"" - not common.

""mulus"" - M is eliminated.

""nulus"" - N eliminated.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U. Valid word? It might be a name, but not common.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U.

So the common ones are ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But ""pulps"" has duplicate P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

What about ""dulia""? Not a word.

""fused"" - but E is eliminated.

""glued"" - E eliminated.

""jules"" - J,U,L,E,S -> E is eliminated.

Not.

""pules"" - P,U,L,E,S -> E eliminated.

Not.

So back to the words we have.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> double B? And it's a word. But then we are testing B in position 1 and 4? But we are not sure if B is in the word.

But ""bulbs"" has S in position 5, which we think is correct.

Similarly, ""humbs"" - H,U,M,B,S -> M is eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" - J,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" - L,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" - P,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" - W,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

So we are left with words like ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

Now, we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be a vowel? But we have U as vowel in position 2.

The available vowels are U (already placed), and then we have: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But among these, what vowels? We have U already, and then Y is eliminated (from ""sulky"": Y(x)).

Y is eliminated, so no Y.

Vowels available: only U is already used, and then we have no other vowels? Because A,E,I,O are eliminated. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y, but Y is eliminated.

So the word must have U in position 2, and the rest are consonants.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be a consonant from the available set.

So let's list the words we have:

- ""bulks"": B1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""gulps"": G1, U2, L3, P4, S5
- ""hulks"": H1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""pulps"": P1, U2, L3, P4, S5 (duplicate P)

We can choose ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that we might have misjudged the position of S. What if the word has S in position 5, but the first letter is something else, and the fourth letter is something else?

We have to guess.

But we have three possibilities for the first letter: B, G, H, or P (for ""pulps"" it's P but duplicate).

We can try ""bulks"" to see.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill, so we have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We know U and L are fixed, S is supposed to be fixed at the end? But we are not 100% sure.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But let's think: we have to fill position 1 and 4.

We can also consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have any indication.

In ""sulky"", we had U in position 2 correct, and we got a dash for S in position 1, and U and L correct. The Y was absent, K absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to be careful: if we guess ""bulks"" and it's wrong, we might not get much information because if B is not in the word, we get x for B, and if K is not, x.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""dulia"" is not a word.

""fused"" has E.

Not.

""glued"" has E.

Not.

""jules"" has E.

Not.

""pules"" has E.

Not.

So the options are limited.

We can try ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But we have to choose one.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Possible words:
- bulks: B and K
- gulps: G and P
- hulks: H and K
- pulps: P and P (duplicate)
- dulkS? ""dulks"" not a word.
- fulkS? ""fulks"" not a word.
- kulkS? ""kulks"" not a word.
- mulkS? M eliminated.
- pulkS? P,U,L,K,S -> ""pulks"" is not a word.
- tulks? T eliminated.

So only a few.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that has B in position 1 and 4? So ""bulbs"" would be B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But ""bulbs"" is a word.

Similarly, ""humbs"" is H1,U2,M3,B4,S5 -> M eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

So ""bulbs"" is a possibility: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5.

But B is repeated.

Similarly, ""hulms"" - H,U,L,M,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5. Duplicate P.

""bulks"" is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

""gulps"" is G1, U2, L3, P4, S5.

""hulks"" is H1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

Now, we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested B, G, H, K, P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might not get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But let's not assume.

We can try a word that has S in position 5 and tests two new letters.

I think ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""bulks"":
- If B is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for B.
- If K is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for K.
- If not, we get x for B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might have to try again.

But we have limited tries.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But what if the word is ""bulks""? Then we get it.

But we don't know.

We can also consider that the word might be ""pulps"", but with duplicate P.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But I think ""bulks"" is a good choice.

But let's list the available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And we know S is in the word, but we are using it at the end.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure that K is available. Yes, K is not eliminated.

So guess: ""bulks""

But let's confirm the pattern: B U L K S -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S.

We are testing B in position 1 and K in position 4.

If the word is ""bulks"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B, and if K is not, then position 4 is not K, and S might not be in position 5? But we are deducing S must be in position 5.

But if we get feedback that K is absent, then we know position 4 is not K, and since we have S in position 5, if K is absent, then we need a different letter for position 4.

But we don't know what it is.

Similarly, if B is absent, then position 1 is not B.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain.

What if the word is ""gulps""? Then we would get B absent and K absent? But then we know to try G and P next.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4.

We can also consider that the word might be ""hulks"" or ""pulps"".

But let's try ""bulks"".

<guess>bulks</guess>

But we must be cautious.

Another word: ""dulks"" is not a word.

""fulks"" not a word.

""kulaks"" - K,U,L,A,K,S -> A eliminated.

Not.

So I think ""bulks"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, S present but wrong position (which we thought was because it was not in 1 or 4, but now we think it should be in 5).

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1. We also have U and L correct. The Y and K were absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to output.

We can also consider ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But I think ""bulks"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, I, T are absent (x), so they are eliminated. S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: sulky** → S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is not in position 1. U is correct (✓) in position 2, L is correct (✓) in position 3. K and Y are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2 must be **U**.
  - Position 3 must be **L**.
  - Position 5 must be **S** (deduced from the feedback: S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 2/3, so it must be in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ U L _ S`.
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 4 need to be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since S, U, L are already placed and U/L are fixed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 4 using common letters from the remaining pool.
- **""bulks""** is a strong guess because:
  - It tests **B** in position 1 and **K** in position 4.
  - B and K are common letters not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, the feedback on B and K will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks""; if K is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks"").

<guess>bulks</guess>",bulks,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for S in position 1), U is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, K and Y absent.

So, from ""sulky"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (we already knew it's not in position 4 from ""moist"", and now position 1 is also wrong).
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K and Y are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has U in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ U L _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 1, 4 (from ""moist"" and ""sulky""), and not in position 2 or 3 (because position 2 is U and position 3 is L, so they are fixed). So S must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,4,5 but we know it's not in 1,4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by U and L. So position 5 is the only possibility? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 left. However, from ""sulky"", S was in position 1 and was wrong, so it can't be in position 1. From ""moist"", it was in position 4 and was wrong, so not in 4. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 5 available. However, we must consider that S could be in position 5, but we haven't tested position 5 for S. Also, note that in ""sulky"", we placed S in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. We also know it's not in position 4. The only positions left are 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5? But we don't have direct evidence for position 5. We need to test.

But wait, the word has positions: 1: ?, 2: U, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

We know S is in the word and cannot be in positions 1,4 (from feedback) and positions 2 and 3 are taken. So the only position left for S is 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5.

But let's confirm: the feedback for ""sulky"" says S(-) for position 1, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about other positions. We already know from ""moist"" that S is not in position 4. And now we know position 2 and 3 are U and L, so S cannot be there. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 1 and 5. We know it's not in position 1. So yes, it must be in position 5.

But we are not 100% sure because the word might have more than one S? But we don't have evidence of that. However, we should consider that S might be in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested all positions except we haven't tested position 5 for S. And we know S is not in 1,4, and 2,3 are fixed. So position 5 is the only possibility.

But what about position 1? We know S is not in position 1, so it must be in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must end with S? But we have the pattern: _ U L _ _

So the word is ? U L ? S? But we have position 5 as S? But we don't know for sure. We need to confirm.

But let's see: we have to fill position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word and must be in one of the positions. As discussed, position 5 is the only one left because position 1 is excluded and 2,3,4 are excluded for S. So position 5 must be S.

Therefore, the word is: _ U L _ S

But we don't know the first letter.

Also, we know K and Y are not in the word.

So, the known information:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: S (we are deducing it must be there)

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters.

The word: [letter1] U L [letter4] S

We know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and they cannot be any of the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.

Also, we know S is in the word, but we are placing it in position 5.

Now, what letters are available? We have the alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, I, K, M, N, O, R, T, Y.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

But U and L are already in the word and in positions 2 and 3. We don't know if they can be repeated? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have repeated letters? But in this case, U and L are already placed, so if the word has another U or L, we don't know. But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates.

However, for the first and fourth positions, we need to choose letters from the available set.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 4.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

The pattern: [1] U L [4] S

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z.

But S is already in position 5, so if we use S again, it might be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's.

We should avoid using S in position 1 because we are trying to find the first letter, and if we use S there, it might be confusing. But we can use S in position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is before S.

But we know that S is not in position 1,4 (from previous), and 2,3 are fixed. So if we put S in position 4, that would be a new position? But we already know S is not in position 4 from ""moist"". So we cannot put S in position 4 because it would be incorrect.

Therefore, for position 4, we cannot put S because we know it's not there. So we must choose a letter that is not S and not the eliminated ones.

Similarly, for position 1, we cannot put S because we know it's not there.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the available letters, excluding S for position 1 and excluding the eliminated letters.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and S? But we cannot use S in position 1, so S is not allowed in position 1).

Similarly, for position 4: same, we cannot use S.

So we have to choose from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.

Let's think of words that end with S and have U in the second position and L in the third.

Common words: 
- ""fulus"" - but F,U,L,U,S? That would be F(1), U(2), L(3), U(4), S(5). But U is repeated? And ""fulus"" is not a common word. Also, we don't know if U can be repeated.

But let's see: we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But we need to use available letters.

Another word: ""bulus"" - B,U,L,U,S -> but again, double U. And B is available.

But is ""bulus"" a word? It might be informal for bulus? Not common.

""dulus"" - D,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""hulus"" - not a word.

""julus"" - not a word.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""xulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U. Zulus are a tribe, but might be accepted? But we have U in position 2 and 4? That would be two U's.

But we don't know if the word has two U's. We only know one U is in position 2.

We need to consider that the fourth letter might be a different letter.

What about words without double U?

For example, ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? No, it ends with S? B,U,L,B,S? Double B? And ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> positions: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But we have B repeated? And ""bulbs"" is a word.

But we have B in position 1 and 4? That's possible.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, ""dulls"" - D,U,L,L,S -> double L? But L is already in position 3. If we put L in position 4, that would be a duplicate L. But we don't know if L is duplicated.

But in ""dulls"", we have L in position 3 and 4? Actually, ""dulls"" is D,U,L,L,S -> so position 4 is L again.

But we know L is in position 3, so if we put L in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to think of words that have U in second, L in third, and S in fifth.

Let me list possible words:

- ""bulks"" - but K is eliminated (from ""moist"": K not tested? Actually, in ""moist"", we had M,O,I,T absent, but K was not tested? Wait, in ""moist"", we had S in position 4 and got a dash, but K was not present. So K is available? But in ""bulks"", we have B,U,L,K,S -> but K is in position 4? And we know K is available? But ""bulks"" has K, but we are trying to avoid K? No, K is available.

But ""bulks"" has K, which is available. However, we have to check if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not eliminated.

But in ""bulks"", the pattern is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5. But we are deducing that S should be in position 5, so this word fits the pattern.

But we have to see if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not in the eliminated list.

But we are not sure about the first letter. We are trying to find what goes in position 1 and 4.

Another word: ""dulia"" - not a word.

""fulus"" - not common.

""gulps"" - G,U,L,P,S -> pattern G1 U2 L3 P4 S5. This is a valid word. And P is available.

Similarly, ""hulks"" - H,U,L,K,S -> H1, U2, L3, K4, S5. Valid word.

""julys"" - not a word.

""pulps"" - P1 U2 L3 P4 S5 -> double P? But it's a word.

""tulips"" - but T is eliminated.

""vulns"" - not a word.

""wolves"" - but O and E are eliminated.

""xenon"" - not matching pattern.

""zilch"" - Z,I,L,C,H -> I and C are eliminated.

Not.

""bulge"" - E is eliminated.

So possible words: ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We also have to consider that we might not be sure about S in position 5. We deduced it must be there, but let's verify the feedback.

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1.

We know position 2 is U, position 3 is L, and position 5 is S? We haven't tested position 5 for S, but we have to place S somewhere. The only position left is 5.

But what if the word has S in position 5? Then position 1 and 4 are something else.

But we have to guess.

We can try one of these words to test.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have evidence.

To be safe, we can choose a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4.

For example, ""bulks"": uses B and K.

""gulps"": uses G and P.

""hulks"": uses H and K.

""pulps"": uses P and P (duplicate P).

We want to test new letters to maximize information.

So ""bulks"" tests B and K.

""gulps"" tests G and P.

""hulks"" tests H and K.

""pulps"" tests P (but duplicate, so less information).

We also have to consider that if we are wrong, we get feedback.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""fulus"" - not common.

""dulus"" - not common.

""mulus"" - M is eliminated.

""nulus"" - N eliminated.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U. Valid word? It might be a name, but not common.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U.

So the common ones are ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But ""pulps"" has duplicate P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

What about ""dulia""? Not a word.

""fused"" - but E is eliminated.

""glued"" - E eliminated.

""jules"" - J,U,L,E,S -> E is eliminated.

Not.

""pules"" - P,U,L,E,S -> E eliminated.

Not.

So back to the words we have.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> double B? And it's a word. But then we are testing B in position 1 and 4? But we are not sure if B is in the word.

But ""bulbs"" has S in position 5, which we think is correct.

Similarly, ""humbs"" - H,U,M,B,S -> M is eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" - J,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" - L,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" - P,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" - W,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

So we are left with words like ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

Now, we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be a vowel? But we have U as vowel in position 2.

The available vowels are U (already placed), and then we have: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But among these, what vowels? We have U already, and then Y is eliminated (from ""sulky"": Y(x)).

Y is eliminated, so no Y.

Vowels available: only U is already used, and then we have no other vowels? Because A,E,I,O are eliminated. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y, but Y is eliminated.

So the word must have U in position 2, and the rest are consonants.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be a consonant from the available set.

So let's list the words we have:

- ""bulks"": B1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""gulps"": G1, U2, L3, P4, S5
- ""hulks"": H1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""pulps"": P1, U2, L3, P4, S5 (duplicate P)

We can choose ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that we might have misjudged the position of S. What if the word has S in position 5, but the first letter is something else, and the fourth letter is something else?

We have to guess.

But we have three possibilities for the first letter: B, G, H, or P (for ""pulps"" it's P but duplicate).

We can try ""bulks"" to see.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill, so we have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We know U and L are fixed, S is supposed to be fixed at the end? But we are not 100% sure.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But let's think: we have to fill position 1 and 4.

We can also consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have any indication.

In ""sulky"", we had U in position 2 correct, and we got a dash for S in position 1, and U and L correct. The Y was absent, K absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to be careful: if we guess ""bulks"" and it's wrong, we might not get much information because if B is not in the word, we get x for B, and if K is not, x.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""dulia"" is not a word.

""fused"" has E.

Not.

""glued"" has E.

Not.

""jules"" has E.

Not.

""pules"" has E.

Not.

So the options are limited.

We can try ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But we have to choose one.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Possible words:
- bulks: B and K
- gulps: G and P
- hulks: H and K
- pulps: P and P (duplicate)
- dulkS? ""dulks"" not a word.
- fulkS? ""fulks"" not a word.
- kulkS? ""kulks"" not a word.
- mulkS? M eliminated.
- pulkS? P,U,L,K,S -> ""pulks"" is not a word.
- tulks? T eliminated.

So only a few.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that has B in position 1 and 4? So ""bulbs"" would be B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But ""bulbs"" is a word.

Similarly, ""humbs"" is H1,U2,M3,B4,S5 -> M eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

So ""bulbs"" is a possibility: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5.

But B is repeated.

Similarly, ""hulms"" - H,U,L,M,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5. Duplicate P.

""bulks"" is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

""gulps"" is G1, U2, L3, P4, S5.

""hulks"" is H1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

Now, we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested B, G, H, K, P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might not get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But let's not assume.

We can try a word that has S in position 5 and tests two new letters.

I think ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""bulks"":
- If B is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for B.
- If K is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for K.
- If not, we get x for B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might have to try again.

But we have limited tries.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But what if the word is ""bulks""? Then we get it.

But we don't know.

We can also consider that the word might be ""pulps"", but with duplicate P.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But I think ""bulks"" is a good choice.

But let's list the available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And we know S is in the word, but we are using it at the end.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure that K is available. Yes, K is not eliminated.

So guess: ""bulks""

But let's confirm the pattern: B U L K S -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S.

We are testing B in position 1 and K in position 4.

If the word is ""bulks"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B, and if K is not, then position 4 is not K, and S might not be in position 5? But we are deducing S must be in position 5.

But if we get feedback that K is absent, then we know position 4 is not K, and since we have S in position 5, if K is absent, then we need a different letter for position 4.

But we don't know what it is.

Similarly, if B is absent, then position 1 is not B.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain.

What if the word is ""gulps""? Then we would get B absent and K absent? But then we know to try G and P next.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4.

We can also consider that the word might be ""hulks"" or ""pulps"".

But let's try ""bulks"".

<guess>bulks</guess>

But we must be cautious.

Another word: ""dulks"" is not a word.

""fulks"" not a word.

""kulaks"" - K,U,L,A,K,S -> A eliminated.

Not.

So I think ""bulks"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, S present but wrong position (which we thought was because it was not in 1 or 4, but now we think it should be in 5).

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1. We also have U and L correct. The Y and K were absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to output.

We can also consider ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But I think ""bulks"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, I, T are absent (x), so they are eliminated. S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: sulky** → S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is not in position 1. U is correct (✓) in position 2, L is correct (✓) in position 3. K and Y are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2 must be **U**.
  - Position 3 must be **L**.
  - Position 5 must be **S** (deduced from the feedback: S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 2/3, so it must be in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ U L _ S`.
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 4 need to be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since S, U, L are already placed and U/L are fixed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 4 using common letters from the remaining pool.
- **""bulks""** is a strong guess because:
  - It tests **B** in position 1 and **K** in position 4.
  - B and K are common letters not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, the feedback on B and K will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks""; if K is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks"").",Guess 4: bulks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many, but we must avoid R and N as well.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters.

 Example words: 
   ""TOILS"" - but we have to check if it uses any forbidden letters: T (allowed), O (allowed), I (allowed), L (allowed), S (allowed). 
   However, we don't know if these are in the word. We want to cover more common letters.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - P, I, O, U, S. But we have U and O which are vowels.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T. Again, all allowed.

 But note: we want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's list the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C, R, A, N, E): 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has as many of these as possible.

 Consider ""TOILS"": T, O, I, L, S -> all allowed and common.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> also very common.

 However, we must ensure the word is valid. Both ""TOILS"" and ""MOIST"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"" because it has M and S which we haven't tried, and it's a common word.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" does not contain any of these.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

<guess>moist</guess>After the first guess ""crane"" received all 'x' feedback, we know the secret word contains none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. For the next guess, we need a word that avoids these letters entirely and tests new common letters to gather more information. 

Words like ""moist"" or ""toils"" are strong candidates since they use frequent consonants (S, T, L, M) and vowels (O, I, U) not yet tested. ""Moist"" is particularly effective as it includes the common letters M, O, I, S, and T. This helps probe multiple new letters at once, increasing the chances of hitting relevant letters in the secret word.

<guess>moist</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"" -> M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). This means:
   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
   - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and got a dash, meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

We have eliminated many common letters. The remaining letters that could be in the word are:
Vowels: U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now)
Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: S is in the word, so we must include S in our next guess, and place it in a different position than the 4th.

We also know the word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We need to choose a word that:
- Includes S (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a position that is not 4th (so try positions 1,2,3, or 5).
- Uses only the remaining letters: from the alphabet excluding C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

Let's list the available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We should try to use common letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters among the remaining: S (we know it's in), L, D, U, P, H, etc.

We also note that S is already in the word, so we can try to place it in a different position and use other common letters.

Possible positions for S: since it was in position 4 in ""moist"" and that was wrong, we can try S in position 1,2,3, or 5.

Let's think of words that have S and use other available letters.

For example:
- Position 1: S _ _ _ _
  Words: ""shuln"" (not common), ""skulk"" (but K is available), ""sulky"" (S,U,L,K,Y) -> but we don't know if U,L,K,Y are in.

But we need valid words.

Another idea: ""shards"" - but that's 6 letters. We need 5.

Let me think of 5-letter words with S and using only the available letters.

Available vowels: U (and Y as semi-vowel)

Words:
- ""sully"" - but has double L? Actually, ""sully"" is a word: S,U,L,L,Y -> but double L? The word allows double letters? The rules don't say they are unique. But in feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in our case, we don't know if L is in the word or not.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

Another word: ""pudgy"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> but no S. We must include S.

So words with S:

- ""spuds"" - S,P,U,D,S -> but double S? And it's a word (spuds being potato chips). But we have two S's? The feedback might handle it.

But let's avoid double letters for now to get more information.

Another word: ""shuds"" - S,H,U,D,S -> again double S.

We can try ""slush"": S,L,U,S,H -> but H is available. However, ""slush"" has two S's.

We need a word without forbidden letters and with S not in the 4th position.

Let me list some words:
- S in position 1: ""skulk"" (S,K,U,L,K) -> but K is repeated? Actually, ""skulk"" has two K's. And it's valid.
- S in position 2: ""psyst"" - not a word. ""usurp"" - U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R is out). R is eliminated.

R is eliminated? From ""crane"": R(x) -> so R is not in the word. Similarly, A,N,E are out.

So forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.

So R is out.

Therefore, we cannot use R.

Similarly, in ""usurp"": R is forbidden, so invalid.

Another with S in position 2: ""psalm"" - P,S,A,L,M -> but A and M are forbidden. A from ""crane"" and M from ""moist"" are out.

So not.

Position 3: S _ _ _ _

Word: ""dusky"" - D,U,S,K,Y -> but S is in the 3rd position? D (position1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). And all letters are available? 
D: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.

And ""dusky"" is a valid word.

But note: we have S in the 3rd position. In ""moist"", S was in 4th and was wrong, but that doesn't prevent 3rd from being wrong? We don't know. We are trying to find the correct position.

Another word: ""pulps"" - P,U,L,P,S -> double P? And S at the end. But we have two P's. It's valid, but might be less informative.

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

""dusky"" uses D,U,S,K,Y. All new letters (except S which we know is in).

Similarly, we could try ""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> but double S. It might be better to avoid double letters for now.

Another word: ""lusty"" - L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from ""moist"": T(x)). T is eliminated.

So ""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""hushy"" - H,U,S,H,Y -> double H? And H is available.

But double letters might not be ideal.

""shushy"" - S,H,U,S,H,Y -> double S and H. Not good.

""blush"" - B,L,U,S,H -> S in 4th position? But we must avoid S in 4th? No, the feedback said S was in the word but wrong position when in 4th. So we can try S in 4th again? Actually, we know S is not in 4th, so we should avoid putting S in 4th to not waste a position? But we can do it if we want, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there.

Actually, the feedback told us S is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we should try S in a different position to find the correct one.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put S in either position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).

In ""dusky"", S is in position 3.

Another word: ""pussy"" - P,U,S,S,Y -> double S. Not ideal.

""busky"" - not a word.

""disco"" - D,I,S,C,O -> but I and C and O are forbidden.

No.

""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> double S.

""jussi"" - not common.

""lusty"" is invalid because of T.

""pudgy"" no S.

We need S.

Another idea: ""sulky"" - S,U,L,K,Y -> S in position 1. This is good because we are trying S in a new position (position 1). And it uses U,L,K,Y which are new.

""sulky"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""dusky"" is also valid.

But ""dusky"" has S in position 3, and ""sulky"" has S in position 1.

We can also consider S in position 5.

For example: ""_ _ _ _ S"" -> but we have to use available letters.

Word: ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> but O and C are forbidden.

Not.

""bass"" is 4 letters.

""lupus"" - L,U,P,U,S -> double U? And S at the end. But U is available. However, ""lupus"" is a word. But it has two U's.

We can try ""sulky"" or ""dusky"".

Let me choose ""sulky"" because it places S at the start, which is a common position.

So guess: ""sulky""

But note: we are testing S in position 1. If we get a check for S, then we know it's in position 1. If not, then we know S is not in position 1 and we can try other positions.

Also, we are testing U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4, Y in position 5.

If any of these are in the word, we get feedback.

So let's go with ""sulky"".

But wait, we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn't use any forbidden letters.

""Sulky"" uses S,U,L,K,Y. 
- S: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
- U, L, K, Y: none of these have been tested yet, and they are not forbidden.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try S in position 5. For example, ""fuses"" -> F,U,S,E,S -> but E is forbidden (from ""crane""). E is out.

""jums"" - J,U,M,S -> M is forbidden (from ""moist"": M(x)).

Not.

""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> M is forbidden.

Not.

So ""sulky"" seems a good choice.

Another option: ""dusky"" has S in position 3.

But ""sulky"" has S in position 1, which we haven't tested.

We can also consider ""shuln"" but that's not common.

Or ""skulk"" - S,K,U,L,K -> double K? But it's valid. S in position 1? Actually, ""skulk"" is S,K,U,L,K -> positions: S1, K2, U3, L4, K5. But K is repeated. It might be acceptable, but we lose information on one position.

""sulky"" is better because all letters are distinct.

So I'll go with ""sulky"".

<guess>sulky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.
- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x), meaning:
  - S is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.
  - M, O, I, T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **S is in the secret word**, but not in position 4.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word cannot contain any of these.
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include **S** (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 4.
  - Use new, common letters from the available set to maximize information (e.g., L, U, K, Y).
  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to test more possibilities.
  - Good candidate: **""sulky""** (S in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4, Y in 5). This tests S in a new position (1) and introduces four new common letters (U, L, K, Y).

<guess>sulky</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
Guess 3: sulky -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for S in position 1), U is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, K and Y absent.

So, from ""sulky"":
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (we already knew it's not in position 4 from ""moist"", and now position 1 is also wrong).
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K and Y are not in the word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has U in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ U L _ _
- S is in the word, but not in position 1, 4 (from ""moist"" and ""sulky""), and not in position 2 or 3 (because position 2 is U and position 3 is L, so they are fixed). So S must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,4,5 but we know it's not in 1,4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by U and L. So position 5 is the only possibility? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 left. However, from ""sulky"", S was in position 1 and was wrong, so it can't be in position 1. From ""moist"", it was in position 4 and was wrong, so not in 4. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 5 available. However, we must consider that S could be in position 5, but we haven't tested position 5 for S. Also, note that in ""sulky"", we placed S in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. We also know it's not in position 4. The only positions left are 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5? But we don't have direct evidence for position 5. We need to test.

But wait, the word has positions: 1: ?, 2: U, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?

We know S is in the word and cannot be in positions 1,4 (from feedback) and positions 2 and 3 are taken. So the only position left for S is 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it's not in position 1. So it must be in position 5.

But let's confirm: the feedback for ""sulky"" says S(-) for position 1, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us about other positions. We already know from ""moist"" that S is not in position 4. And now we know position 2 and 3 are U and L, so S cannot be there. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 1 and 5. We know it's not in position 1. So yes, it must be in position 5.

But we are not 100% sure because the word might have more than one S? But we don't have evidence of that. However, we should consider that S might be in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested all positions except we haven't tested position 5 for S. And we know S is not in 1,4, and 2,3 are fixed. So position 5 is the only possibility.

But what about position 1? We know S is not in position 1, so it must be in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must end with S? But we have the pattern: _ U L _ _

So the word is ? U L ? S? But we have position 5 as S? But we don't know for sure. We need to confirm.

But let's see: we have to fill position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word and must be in one of the positions. As discussed, position 5 is the only one left because position 1 is excluded and 2,3,4 are excluded for S. So position 5 must be S.

Therefore, the word is: _ U L _ S

But we don't know the first letter.

Also, we know K and Y are not in the word.

So, the known information:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: S (we are deducing it must be there)

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters.

The word: [letter1] U L [letter4] S

We know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and they cannot be any of the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.

Also, we know S is in the word, but we are placing it in position 5.

Now, what letters are available? We have the alphabet minus the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, C, E, I, K, M, N, O, R, T, Y.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

But U and L are already in the word and in positions 2 and 3. We don't know if they can be repeated? The rules don't say the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have repeated letters? But in this case, U and L are already placed, so if the word has another U or L, we don't know. But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates.

But we must consider that the word might have duplicates.

However, for the first and fourth positions, we need to choose letters from the available set.

But note: we also have to consider that we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 4.

We can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

The pattern: [1] U L [4] S

We need to choose letter1 and letter4 from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z.

But S is already in position 5, so if we use S again, it might be a duplicate. But we don't know if the word has two S's.

We should avoid using S in position 1 because we are trying to find the first letter, and if we use S there, it might be confusing. But we can use S in position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is before S.

But we know that S is not in position 1,4 (from previous), and 2,3 are fixed. So if we put S in position 4, that would be a new position? But we already know S is not in position 4 from ""moist"". So we cannot put S in position 4 because it would be incorrect.

Therefore, for position 4, we cannot put S because we know it's not there. So we must choose a letter that is not S and not the eliminated ones.

Similarly, for position 1, we cannot put S because we know it's not there.

So we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the available letters, excluding S for position 1 and excluding the eliminated letters.

Available for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and S? But we cannot use S in position 1, so S is not allowed in position 1).

Similarly, for position 4: same, we cannot use S.

So we have to choose from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.

Let's think of words that end with S and have U in the second position and L in the third.

Common words: 
- ""fulus"" - but F,U,L,U,S? That would be F(1), U(2), L(3), U(4), S(5). But U is repeated? And ""fulus"" is not a common word. Also, we don't know if U can be repeated.

But let's see: we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U.

Similarly, we could have other words.

But we need to use available letters.

Another word: ""bulus"" - B,U,L,U,S -> but again, double U. And B is available.

But is ""bulus"" a word? It might be informal for bulus? Not common.

""dulus"" - D,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""hulus"" - not a word.

""julus"" - not a word.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""xulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U. Zulus are a tribe, but might be accepted? But we have U in position 2 and 4? That would be two U's.

But we don't know if the word has two U's. We only know one U is in position 2.

We need to consider that the fourth letter might be a different letter.

What about words without double U?

For example, ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? No, it ends with S? B,U,L,B,S? Double B? And ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> positions: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But we have B repeated? And ""bulbs"" is a word.

But we have B in position 1 and 4? That's possible.

But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, ""dulls"" - D,U,L,L,S -> double L? But L is already in position 3. If we put L in position 4, that would be a duplicate L. But we don't know if L is duplicated.

But in ""dulls"", we have L in position 3 and 4? Actually, ""dulls"" is D,U,L,L,S -> so position 4 is L again.

But we know L is in position 3, so if we put L in position 4, it might be a duplicate.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We need to think of words that have U in second, L in third, and S in fifth.

Let me list possible words:

- ""bulks"" - but K is eliminated (from ""moist"": K not tested? Actually, in ""moist"", we had M,O,I,T absent, but K was not tested? Wait, in ""moist"", we had S in position 4 and got a dash, but K was not present. So K is available? But in ""bulks"", we have B,U,L,K,S -> but K is in position 4? And we know K is available? But ""bulks"" has K, but we are trying to avoid K? No, K is available.

But ""bulks"" has K, which is available. However, we have to check if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not eliminated.

But in ""bulks"", the pattern is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5. But we are deducing that S should be in position 5, so this word fits the pattern.

But we have to see if K is allowed. Yes, because it's not in the eliminated list.

But we are not sure about the first letter. We are trying to find what goes in position 1 and 4.

Another word: ""dulia"" - not a word.

""fulus"" - not common.

""gulps"" - G,U,L,P,S -> pattern G1 U2 L3 P4 S5. This is a valid word. And P is available.

Similarly, ""hulks"" - H,U,L,K,S -> H1, U2, L3, K4, S5. Valid word.

""julys"" - not a word.

""pulps"" - P1 U2 L3 P4 S5 -> double P? But it's a word.

""tulips"" - but T is eliminated.

""vulns"" - not a word.

""wolves"" - but O and E are eliminated.

""xenon"" - not matching pattern.

""zilch"" - Z,I,L,C,H -> I and C are eliminated.

Not.

""bulge"" - E is eliminated.

So possible words: ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But we need to choose one that tests new letters.

We also have to consider that we might not be sure about S in position 5. We deduced it must be there, but let's verify the feedback.

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1.

We know position 2 is U, position 3 is L, and position 5 is S? We haven't tested position 5 for S, but we have to place S somewhere. The only position left is 5.

But what if the word has S in position 5? Then position 1 and 4 are something else.

But we have to guess.

We can try one of these words to test.

But we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have evidence.

To be safe, we can choose a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4.

For example, ""bulks"": uses B and K.

""gulps"": uses G and P.

""hulks"": uses H and K.

""pulps"": uses P and P (duplicate P).

We want to test new letters to maximize information.

So ""bulks"" tests B and K.

""gulps"" tests G and P.

""hulks"" tests H and K.

""pulps"" tests P (but duplicate, so less information).

We also have to consider that if we are wrong, we get feedback.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""fulus"" - not common.

""dulus"" - not common.

""mulus"" - M is eliminated.

""nulus"" - N eliminated.

""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U. Valid word? It might be a name, but not common.

""vulus"" - not a word.

""wulus"" - not a word.

""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U.

So the common ones are ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

But ""pulps"" has duplicate P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.

What about ""dulia""? Not a word.

""fused"" - but E is eliminated.

""glued"" - E eliminated.

""jules"" - J,U,L,E,S -> E is eliminated.

Not.

""pules"" - P,U,L,E,S -> E eliminated.

Not.

So back to the words we have.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> double B? And it's a word. But then we are testing B in position 1 and 4? But we are not sure if B is in the word.

But ""bulbs"" has S in position 5, which we think is correct.

Similarly, ""humbs"" - H,U,M,B,S -> M is eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" - J,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" - L,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" - P,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" - W,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

So we are left with words like ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".

Now, we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be a vowel? But we have U as vowel in position 2.

The available vowels are U (already placed), and then we have: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But among these, what vowels? We have U already, and then Y is eliminated (from ""sulky"": Y(x)).

Y is eliminated, so no Y.

Vowels available: only U is already used, and then we have no other vowels? Because A,E,I,O are eliminated. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y, but Y is eliminated.

So the word must have U in position 2, and the rest are consonants.

Therefore, the fourth letter must be a consonant from the available set.

So let's list the words we have:

- ""bulks"": B1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""gulps"": G1, U2, L3, P4, S5
- ""hulks"": H1, U2, L3, K4, S5
- ""pulps"": P1, U2, L3, P4, S5 (duplicate P)

We can choose ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But we also have to consider that we might have misjudged the position of S. What if the word has S in position 5, but the first letter is something else, and the fourth letter is something else?

We have to guess.

But we have three possibilities for the first letter: B, G, H, or P (for ""pulps"" it's P but duplicate).

We can try ""bulks"" to see.

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill, so we have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

We know U and L are fixed, S is supposed to be fixed at the end? But we are not 100% sure.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But let's think: we have to fill position 1 and 4.

We can also consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? For example, if the word has two U's? But we don't have any indication.

In ""sulky"", we had U in position 2 correct, and we got a dash for S in position 1, and U and L correct. The Y was absent, K absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to be careful: if we guess ""bulks"" and it's wrong, we might not get much information because if B is not in the word, we get x for B, and if K is not, x.

But we are trying to solve.

Another word: ""dulia"" is not a word.

""fused"" has E.

Not.

""glued"" has E.

Not.

""jules"" has E.

Not.

""pules"" has E.

Not.

So the options are limited.

We can try ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But we have to choose one.

Let me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

Possible words:
- bulks: B and K
- gulps: G and P
- hulks: H and K
- pulps: P and P (duplicate)
- dulkS? ""dulks"" not a word.
- fulkS? ""fulks"" not a word.
- kulkS? ""kulks"" not a word.
- mulkS? M eliminated.
- pulkS? P,U,L,K,S -> ""pulks"" is not a word.
- tulks? T eliminated.

So only a few.

We can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that has B in position 1 and 4? So ""bulbs"" would be B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But ""bulbs"" is a word.

Similarly, ""humbs"" is H1,U2,M3,B4,S5 -> M eliminated.

Not.

""jumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""lumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""pumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

""wumps"" M eliminated.

Not.

So ""bulbs"" is a possibility: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5.

But B is repeated.

Similarly, ""hulms"" - H,U,L,M,S -> M eliminated.

Not.

""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5. Duplicate P.

""bulks"" is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

""gulps"" is G1, U2, L3, P4, S5.

""hulks"" is H1, U2, L3, K4, S5.

Now, we have to choose one.

We can also consider that we have not tested B, G, H, K, P.

We can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might not get information about other letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But let's not assume.

We can try a word that has S in position 5 and tests two new letters.

I think ""bulks"" is a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""bulks"":
- If B is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for B.
- If K is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for K.
- If not, we get x for B and K.

But if we are wrong, we might have to try again.

But we have limited tries.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.

But what if the word is ""bulks""? Then we get it.

But we don't know.

We can also consider that the word might be ""pulps"", but with duplicate P.

But let's not jump to conclusions.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But I think ""bulks"" is a good choice.

But let's list the available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

And we know S is in the word, but we are using it at the end.

So I'll go with ""bulks"".

But we have to make sure that K is available. Yes, K is not eliminated.

So guess: ""bulks""

But let's confirm the pattern: B U L K S -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S.

We are testing B in position 1 and K in position 4.

If the word is ""bulks"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

But if B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B, and if K is not, then position 4 is not K, and S might not be in position 5? But we are deducing S must be in position 5.

But if we get feedback that K is absent, then we know position 4 is not K, and since we have S in position 5, if K is absent, then we need a different letter for position 4.

But we don't know what it is.

Similarly, if B is absent, then position 1 is not B.

But we have other options.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 5? But we are almost certain.

What if the word is ""gulps""? Then we would get B absent and K absent? But then we know to try G and P next.

But we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4.

We can also consider that the word might be ""hulks"" or ""pulps"".

But let's try ""bulks"".

<guess>bulks</guess>

But we must be cautious.

Another word: ""dulks"" is not a word.

""fulks"" not a word.

""kulaks"" - K,U,L,A,K,S -> A eliminated.

Not.

So I think ""bulks"" is a reasonable guess.

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, S present but wrong position (which we thought was because it was not in 1 or 4, but now we think it should be in 5).

In ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1. We also have U and L correct. The Y and K were absent.

So for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".

But we have to output.

We can also consider ""hulks"" to test H and K.

But I think ""bulks"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, I, T are absent (x), so they are eliminated. S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is in the secret word but not in position 4.
- **Guess 3: sulky** → S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is not in position 1. U is correct (✓) in position 2, L is correct (✓) in position 3. K and Y are absent (x), so they are eliminated.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**: 
  - Position 2 must be **U**.
  - Position 3 must be **L**.
  - Position 5 must be **S** (deduced from the feedback: S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 2/3, so it must be in position 5).
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ U L _ S`.
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 4 need to be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since S, U, L are already placed and U/L are fixed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 4 using common letters from the remaining pool.
- **""bulks""** is a strong guess because:
  - It tests **B** in position 1 and **K** in position 4.
  - B and K are common letters not yet tested.
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, the feedback on B and K will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks""; if K is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks"").

This means:\n   - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with -).\n   - M, O, I, T are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word contains the letter S, but not in the 4th position (since in ""moist"" it was the 4th letter and got a dash, meaning it\'s present but misplaced).\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.\n\nWe have eliminated many common letters.

We need 5.\n\nLet me think of 5-letter words with S and using only the available letters.\n\nAvailable vowels: U (and Y as semi-vowel)\n\nWords:\n- ""sully"" - but has double L? Actually, ""sully"" is a word: S,U,L,L,Y -> but double L? The word allows double letters? The rules don\'t say they are unique. But in feedback, if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in our case, we don\'t know if L is in the word or not.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nAnother word: ""pudgy"" - P,U,D,G,Y -> but no S. We must include S.\n\nSo words with S:\n\n- ""spuds"" - S,P,U,D,S -> but double S? And it\'s a word (spuds being potato chips). But we have two S\'s? The feedback might handle it.\n\nBut let\'s avoid double letters for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""shuds"" - S,H,U,D,S -> again double S.\n\nWe can try ""slush"": S,L,U,S,H -> but H is available. However, ""slush"" has two S\'s.\n\nWe need a word without forbidden letters and with S not in the 4th position.\n\nLet me list some words:\n- S in position 1: ""skulk"" (S,K,U,L,K) -> but K is repeated? Actually, ""skulk"" has two K\'s. And it\'s valid.\n- S in position 2: ""psyst"" - not a word. ""usurp"" - U,S,U,R,P -> but R is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R is out). R is eliminated.\n\nR is eliminated? From ""crane"": R(x) -> so R is not in the word. Similarly, A,N,E are out.\n\nSo forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.\n\nSo R is out.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use R.\n\nSimilarly, in ""usurp"": R is forbidden, so invalid.\n\nAnother with S in position 2: ""psalm"" - P,S,A,L,M -> but A and M are forbidden. A from ""crane"" and M from ""moist"" are out.\n\nSo not.\n\nPosition 3: S _ _ _ _\n\nWord: ""dusky"" - D,U,S,K,Y -> but S is in the 3rd position? D (position1), U(2), S(3), K(4), Y(5). And all letters are available? \nD: allowed, U: allowed, S: allowed, K: allowed, Y: allowed.\n\nAnd ""dusky"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we have S in the 3rd position. In ""moist"", S was in 4th and was wrong, but that doesn\'t prevent 3rd from being wrong? We don\'t know. We are trying to find the correct position.\n\nAnother word: ""pulps"" - P,U,L,P,S -> double P? And S at the end. But we have two P\'s. It\'s valid, but might be less informative.\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n""dusky"" uses D,U,S,K,Y. All new letters (except S which we know is in).\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> but double S. It might be better to avoid double letters for now.\n\nAnother word: ""lusty"" - L,U,S,T,Y -> but T is forbidden (from ""moist"": T(x)). T is eliminated.\n\nSo ""lusty"" is invalid because of T.\n\n""hushy"" - H,U,S,H,Y -> double H? And H is available.\n\nBut double letters might not be ideal.\n\n""shushy"" - S,H,U,S,H,Y -> double S and H. Not good.\n\n""blush"" - B,L,U,S,H -> S in 4th position? But we must avoid S in 4th? No, the feedback said S was in the word but wrong position when in 4th. So we can try S in 4th again? Actually, we know S is not in 4th, so we should avoid putting S in 4th to not waste a position? But we can do it if we want, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there.\n\nActually, the feedback told us S is in the word but not in the 4th position. So we should try S in a different position to find the correct one.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put S in either position 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 4).\n\nIn ""dusky"", S is in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""pussy"" - P,U,S,S,Y -> double S. Not ideal.\n\n""busky"" - not a word.\n\n""disco"" - D,I,S,C,O -> but I and C and O are forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\n""fussy"" - F,U,S,S,Y -> double S.\n\n""jussi"" - not common.\n\n""lusty"" is invalid because of T.\n\n""pudgy"" no S.\n\nWe need S.\n\nAnother idea: ""sulky"" - S,U,L,K,Y -> S in position 1. This is good because we are trying S in a new position (position 1). And it uses U,L,K,Y which are new.\n\n""sulky"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""dusky"" is also valid.\n\nBut ""dusky"" has S in position 3, and ""sulky"" has S in position 1.\n\nWe can also consider S in position 5.\n\nFor example: ""_ _ _ _ S"" -> but we have to use available letters.\n\nWord: ""focus"" -> F,O,C,U,S -> but O and C are forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\n""bass"" is 4 letters.\n\n""lupus"" - L,U,P,U,S -> double U? And S at the end. But U is available. However, ""lupus"" is a word. But it has two U\'s.\n\nWe can try ""sulky"" or ""dusky"".\n\nLet me choose ""sulky"" because it places S at the start, which is a common position.\n\nSo guess: ""sulky""\n\nBut note: we are testing S in position 1. If we get a check for S, then we know it\'s in position 1. If not, then we know S is not in position 1 and we can try other positions.\n\nAlso, we are testing U in position 2, L in position 3, K in position 4, Y in position 5.\n\nIf any of these are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""sulky"".\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that the word is valid and doesn\'t use any forbidden letters.\n\n""Sulky"" uses S,U,L,K,Y. \n- S: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.\n- U, L, K, Y: none of these have been tested yet, and they are not forbidden.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try S in position 5. For example, ""fuses"" -> F,U,S,E,S -> but E is forbidden (from ""crane""). E is out.\n\n""jums"" - J,U,M,S -> M is forbidden (from ""moist"": M(x)).\n\nNot.\n\n""pumps"" -> P,U,M,P,S -> M is forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""sulky"" seems a good choice.\n\nAnother option: ""dusky"" has S in position 3.\n\nBut ""sulky"" has S in position 1, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe can also consider ""shuln"" but that\'s not common.\n\nOr ""skulk"" - S,K,U,L,K -> double K? But it\'s valid. S in position 1? Actually, ""skulk"" is S,K,U,L,K -> positions: S1, K2, U3, L4, K5. But K is repeated. It might be acceptable, but we lose information on one position.\n\n""sulky"" is better because all letters are distinct.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""sulky"".\n\n<guess>sulky</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters (C, R, A, N, E) marked as absent (x), so these letters are not in the secret word.\n- ""moist"" had M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x), meaning:\n  - S is in the secret word but not in the 4th position.\n  - M, O, I, T are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **S is in the secret word**, but not in position 4.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word cannot contain any of these.\n- **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- **Strategy for next guess**:\n  - Must include **S** (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 4.\n  - Use new, common letters from the available set to maximize information (e.g., L, U, K, Y).\n  - Prioritize words with distinct letters to test more possibilities.\n  - Good candidate: **""sulky""** (S in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4, Y in 5). This tests S in a new position (1) and introduces four new common letters (U, L, K, Y).\n\n<guess>sulky</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: sulky -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (since we got a dash for S in position 1), U is correct in position 2, L is correct in position 3, K and Y absent.\n\nSo, from ""sulky"":\n- S is in the word but not in position 1 (we already knew it\'s not in position 4 from ""moist"", and now position 1 is also wrong).\n- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- L is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- K and Y are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word has U in position 2 and L in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ U L _ _\n- S is in the word, but not in position 1, 4 (from ""moist"" and ""sulky""), and not in position 2 or 3 (because position 2 is U and position 3 is L, so they are fixed). So S must be in position 5? Because the only positions left are 1,4,5 but we know it\'s not in 1,4, and positions 2 and 3 are taken by U and L. So position 5 is the only possibility? But wait, we have position 1 and 5 left. However, from ""sulky"", S was in position 1 and was wrong, so it can\'t be in position 1. From ""moist"", it was in position 4 and was wrong, so not in 4. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 5 available. However, we must consider that S could be in position 5, but we haven\'t tested position 5 for S. Also, note that in ""sulky"", we placed S in position 1 and got a dash, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. We also know it\'s not in position 4. The only positions left are 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it\'s not in position 1. So it must be in position 5? But we don\'t have direct evidence for position 5. We need to test.\n\nBut wait, the word has positions: 1: ?, 2: U, 3: L, 4: ?, 5: ?\n\nWe know S is in the word and cannot be in positions 1,4 (from feedback) and positions 2 and 3 are taken. So the only position left for S is 5? But we have position 1 and 5. However, we know it\'s not in position 1. So it must be in position 5.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: the feedback for ""sulky"" says S(-) for position 1, meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn\'t tell us about other positions. We already know from ""moist"" that S is not in position 4. And now we know position 2 and 3 are U and L, so S cannot be there. Therefore, S must be in position 5? But we have position 1 and 5. We know it\'s not in position 1. So yes, it must be in position 5.\n\nBut we are not 100% sure because the word might have more than one S? But we don\'t have evidence of that. However, we should consider that S might be in a position we haven\'t tested? But we have tested all positions except we haven\'t tested position 5 for S. And we know S is not in 1,4, and 2,3 are fixed. So position 5 is the only possibility.\n\nBut what about position 1? We know S is not in position 1, so it must be in position 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must end with S? But we have the pattern: _ U L _ _\n\nSo the word is ? U L ? S? But we have position 5 as S? But we don\'t know for sure. We need to confirm.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to fill position 1 and 5. We know S is in the word and must be in one of the positions. As discussed, position 5 is the only one left because position 1 is excluded and 2,3,4 are excluded for S. So position 5 must be S.\n\nTherefore, the word is: _ U L _ S\n\nBut we don\'t know the first letter.\n\nAlso, we know K and Y are not in the word.\n\nSo, the known information:\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: L\n- Position 5: S (we are deducing it must be there)\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fourth letters.\n\nThe word: [letter1] U L [letter4] S\n\nWe know letter1 and letter4 must be from the remaining available letters, and they cannot be any of the eliminated letters.\n\nEliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.\n\nAlso, we know S is in the word, but we are placing it in position 5.\n\nNow, what letters are available? We have the alphabet minus the eliminated ones.\n\nEliminated: A, C, E, I, K, M, N, O, R, T, Y.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut U and L are already in the word and in positions 2 and 3. We don\'t know if they can be repeated? The rules don\'t say the word has unique letters. So it\'s possible to have repeated letters? But in this case, U and L are already placed, so if the word has another U or L, we don\'t know. But we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates.\n\nBut we must consider that the word might have duplicates.\n\nHowever, for the first and fourth positions, we need to choose letters from the available set.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 4.\n\nWe can try to form a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.\n\nThe pattern: [1] U L [4] S\n\nWe need to choose letter1 and letter4 from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut S is already in position 5, so if we use S again, it might be a duplicate. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nWe should avoid using S in position 1 because we are trying to find the first letter, and if we use S there, it might be confusing. But we can use S in position 4? But position 4 is the fourth letter, which is before S.\n\nBut we know that S is not in position 1,4 (from previous), and 2,3 are fixed. So if we put S in position 4, that would be a new position? But we already know S is not in position 4 from ""moist"". So we cannot put S in position 4 because it would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, for position 4, we cannot put S because we know it\'s not there. So we must choose a letter that is not S and not the eliminated ones.\n\nSimilarly, for position 1, we cannot put S because we know it\'s not there.\n\nSo we need to choose a letter for position 1 and position 4 from the available letters, excluding S for position 1 and excluding the eliminated letters.\n\nAvailable for position 1: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and S? But we cannot use S in position 1, so S is not allowed in position 1).\n\nSimilarly, for position 4: same, we cannot use S.\n\nSo we have to choose from: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a valid English word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with S and have U in the second position and L in the third.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""fulus"" - but F,U,L,U,S? That would be F(1), U(2), L(3), U(4), S(5). But U is repeated? And ""fulus"" is not a common word. Also, we don\'t know if U can be repeated.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U.\n\nSimilarly, we could have other words.\n\nBut we need to use available letters.\n\nAnother word: ""bulus"" - B,U,L,U,S -> but again, double U. And B is available.\n\nBut is ""bulus"" a word? It might be informal for bulus? Not common.\n\n""dulus"" - D,U,L,U,S -> double U.\n\n""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> double U.\n\n""hulus"" - not a word.\n\n""julus"" - not a word.\n\n""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U.\n\n""vulus"" - not a word.\n\n""wulus"" - not a word.\n\n""xulus"" - not a word.\n\n""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U. Zulus are a tribe, but might be accepted? But we have U in position 2 and 4? That would be two U\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two U\'s. We only know one U is in position 2.\n\nWe need to consider that the fourth letter might be a different letter.\n\nWhat about words without double U?\n\nFor example, ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? No, it ends with S? B,U,L,B,S? Double B? And ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> positions: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But we have B repeated? And ""bulbs"" is a word.\n\nBut we have B in position 1 and 4? That\'s possible.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""dulls"" - D,U,L,L,S -> double L? But L is already in position 3. If we put L in position 4, that would be a duplicate L. But we don\'t know if L is duplicated.\n\nBut in ""dulls"", we have L in position 3 and 4? Actually, ""dulls"" is D,U,L,L,S -> so position 4 is L again.\n\nBut we know L is in position 3, so if we put L in position 4, it might be a duplicate.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\nWe need to think of words that have U in second, L in third, and S in fifth.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""bulks"" - but K is eliminated (from ""moist"": K not tested? Actually, in ""moist"", we had M,O,I,T absent, but K was not tested? Wait, in ""moist"", we had S in position 4 and got a dash, but K was not present. So K is available? But in ""bulks"", we have B,U,L,K,S -> but K is in position 4? And we know K is available? But ""bulks"" has K, but we are trying to avoid K? No, K is available.\n\nBut ""bulks"" has K, which is available. However, we have to check if K is allowed. Yes, because it\'s not eliminated.\n\nBut in ""bulks"", the pattern is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5. But we are deducing that S should be in position 5, so this word fits the pattern.\n\nBut we have to see if K is allowed. Yes, because it\'s not in the eliminated list.\n\nBut we are not sure about the first letter. We are trying to find what goes in position 1 and 4.\n\nAnother word: ""dulia"" - not a word.\n\n""fulus"" - not common.\n\n""gulps"" - G,U,L,P,S -> pattern G1 U2 L3 P4 S5. This is a valid word. And P is available.\n\nSimilarly, ""hulks"" - H,U,L,K,S -> H1, U2, L3, K4, S5. Valid word.\n\n""julys"" - not a word.\n\n""pulps"" - P1 U2 L3 P4 S5 -> double P? But it\'s a word.\n\n""tulips"" - but T is eliminated.\n\n""vulns"" - not a word.\n\n""wolves"" - but O and E are eliminated.\n\n""xenon"" - not matching pattern.\n\n""zilch"" - Z,I,L,C,H -> I and C are eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""bulge"" - E is eliminated.\n\nSo possible words: ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".\n\nBut we need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe also have to consider that we might not be sure about S in position 5. We deduced it must be there, but let\'s verify the feedback.\n\nIn ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1.\n\nWe know position 2 is U, position 3 is L, and position 5 is S? We haven\'t tested position 5 for S, but we have to place S somewhere. The only position left is 5.\n\nBut what if the word has S in position 5? Then position 1 and 4 are something else.\n\nBut we have to guess.\n\nWe can try one of these words to test.\n\nBut we also need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? For example, if the word has two U\'s? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose a word that uses two new letters for positions 1 and 4.\n\nFor example, ""bulks"": uses B and K.\n\n""gulps"": uses G and P.\n\n""hulks"": uses H and K.\n\n""pulps"": uses P and P (duplicate P).\n\nWe want to test new letters to maximize information.\n\nSo ""bulks"" tests B and K.\n\n""gulps"" tests G and P.\n\n""hulks"" tests H and K.\n\n""pulps"" tests P (but duplicate, so less information).\n\nWe also have to consider that if we are wrong, we get feedback.\n\nBut we are trying to solve.\n\nAnother word: ""fulus"" - not common.\n\n""dulus"" - not common.\n\n""mulus"" - M is eliminated.\n\n""nulus"" - N eliminated.\n\n""pulus"" - P,U,L,U,S -> double U. Valid word? It might be a name, but not common.\n\n""vulus"" - not a word.\n\n""wulus"" - not a word.\n\n""zulus"" - Z,U,L,U,S -> double U.\n\nSo the common ones are ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".\n\nBut ""pulps"" has duplicate P.\n\nWe can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be something else.\n\nWhat about ""dulia""? Not a word.\n\n""fused"" - but E is eliminated.\n\n""glued"" - E eliminated.\n\n""jules"" - J,U,L,E,S -> E is eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""pules"" - P,U,L,E,S -> E eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nSo back to the words we have.\n\nWe can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that ends with S? ""bulbs"" is B,U,L,B,S -> double B? And it\'s a word. But then we are testing B in position 1 and 4? But we are not sure if B is in the word.\n\nBut ""bulbs"" has S in position 5, which we think is correct.\n\nSimilarly, ""humbs"" - H,U,M,B,S -> M is eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""jumps"" - J,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""lumps"" - L,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""pumps"" - P,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""wumps"" - W,U,M,P,S -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nSo we are left with words like ""bulks"", ""gulps"", ""hulks"", ""pulps"".\n\nNow, we also have to consider that the fourth letter might be a vowel? But we have U as vowel in position 2.\n\nThe available vowels are U (already placed), and then we have: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But among these, what vowels? We have U already, and then Y is eliminated (from ""sulky"": Y(x)).\n\nY is eliminated, so no Y.\n\nVowels available: only U is already used, and then we have no other vowels? Because A,E,I,O are eliminated. So the only vowel left is U? And sometimes Y, but Y is eliminated.\n\nSo the word must have U in position 2, and the rest are consonants.\n\nTherefore, the fourth letter must be a consonant from the available set.\n\nSo let\'s list the words we have:\n\n- ""bulks"": B1, U2, L3, K4, S5\n- ""gulps"": G1, U2, L3, P4, S5\n- ""hulks"": H1, U2, L3, K4, S5\n- ""pulps"": P1, U2, L3, P4, S5 (duplicate P)\n\nWe can choose ""bulks"" to test B and K.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might have misjudged the position of S. What if the word has S in position 5, but the first letter is something else, and the fourth letter is something else?\n\nWe have to guess.\n\nBut we have three possibilities for the first letter: B, G, H, or P (for ""pulps"" it\'s P but duplicate).\n\nWe can try ""bulks"" to see.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests more letters? But we only have two positions to fill, so we have to guess a word that fits the pattern.\n\nWe know U and L are fixed, S is supposed to be fixed at the end? But we are not 100% sure.\n\nWe can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.\n\nBut let\'s think: we have to fill position 1 and 4.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might have a duplicate letter? For example, if the word has two U\'s? But we don\'t have any indication.\n\nIn ""sulky"", we had U in position 2 correct, and we got a dash for S in position 1, and U and L correct. The Y was absent, K absent.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".\n\nBut we have to be careful: if we guess ""bulks"" and it\'s wrong, we might not get much information because if B is not in the word, we get x for B, and if K is not, x.\n\nBut we are trying to solve.\n\nAnother word: ""dulia"" is not a word.\n\n""fused"" has E.\n\nNot.\n\n""glued"" has E.\n\nNot.\n\n""jules"" has E.\n\nNot.\n\n""pules"" has E.\n\nNot.\n\nSo the options are limited.\n\nWe can try ""hulks"" to test H and K.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- bulks: B and K\n- gulps: G and P\n- hulks: H and K\n- pulps: P and P (duplicate)\n- dulkS? ""dulks"" not a word.\n- fulkS? ""fulks"" not a word.\n- kulkS? ""kulks"" not a word.\n- mulkS? M eliminated.\n- pulkS? P,U,L,K,S -> ""pulks"" is not a word.\n- tulks? T eliminated.\n\nSo only a few.\n\nWe can also consider ""bulbs"" - but that has B in position 1 and 4? So ""bulbs"" would be B1, U2, L3, B4, S5. But ""bulbs"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""humbs"" is H1,U2,M3,B4,S5 -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""jumps"" M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""lumps"" M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""pumps"" M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""wumps"" M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""bulbs"" is a possibility: B1, U2, L3, B4, S5.\n\nBut B is repeated.\n\nSimilarly, ""hulms"" - H,U,L,M,S -> M eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\n""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5. Duplicate P.\n\n""bulks"" is B1, U2, L3, K4, S5.\n\n""gulps"" is G1, U2, L3, P4, S5.\n\n""hulks"" is H1, U2, L3, K4, S5.\n\nNow, we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested B, G, H, K, P.\n\nWe can try ""bulks"" to test B and K.\n\nBut if we are wrong, we might not get information about other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.\n\nBut let\'s not assume.\n\nWe can try a word that has S in position 5 and tests two new letters.\n\nI think ""bulks"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""bulks"":\n- If B is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for B.\n- If K is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for K.\n- If not, we get x for B and K.\n\nBut if we are wrong, we might have to try again.\n\nBut we have limited tries.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that doesn\'t have S in position 5? But we are almost certain that S is in position 5.\n\nBut what if the word is ""bulks""? Then we get it.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might be ""pulps"", but with duplicate P.\n\nBut let\'s not jump to conclusions.\n\nWe can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.\n\nBut I think ""bulks"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s list the available letters again: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nAnd we know S is in the word, but we are using it at the end.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""bulks"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that K is available. Yes, K is not eliminated.\n\nSo guess: ""bulks""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: B U L K S -> positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:L, 4:K, 5:S.\n\nWe are testing B in position 1 and K in position 4.\n\nIf the word is ""bulks"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nBut if B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B, and if K is not, then position 4 is not K, and S might not be in position 5? But we are deducing S must be in position 5.\n\nBut if we get feedback that K is absent, then we know position 4 is not K, and since we have S in position 5, if K is absent, then we need a different letter for position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know what it is.\n\nSimilarly, if B is absent, then position 1 is not B.\n\nBut we have other options.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have S in position 5? But we are almost certain.\n\nWhat if the word is ""gulps""? Then we would get B absent and K absent? But then we know to try G and P next.\n\nBut we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 4.\n\nWe can also consider that the word might be ""hulks"" or ""pulps"".\n\nBut let\'s try ""bulks"".\n\n<guess>bulks</guess>\n\nBut we must be cautious.\n\nAnother word: ""dulks"" is not a word.\n\n""fulks"" not a word.\n\n""kulaks"" - K,U,L,A,K,S -> A eliminated.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think ""bulks"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, S present but wrong position (which we thought was because it was not in 1 or 4, but now we think it should be in 5).\n\nIn ""sulky"", we had S in position 1: dash, meaning S is in the word but not position 1. We also have U and L correct. The Y and K were absent.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can try ""bulks"".\n\nBut we have to output.\n\nWe can also consider ""hulks"" to test H and K.\n\nBut I think ""bulks"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are eliminated.\n- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, I, T are absent (x), so they are eliminated. S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is in the secret word but not in position 4.\n- **Guess 3: sulky** → S is present but in the wrong position (-), so S is not in position 1. U is correct (✓) in position 2, L is correct (✓) in position 3. K and Y are absent (x), so they are eliminated.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Confirmed positions**: \n  - Position 2 must be **U**.\n  - Position 3 must be **L**.\n  - Position 5 must be **S** (deduced from the feedback: S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 2/3, so it must be in position 5).\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y.\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ U L _ S`.\n- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 4 need to be filled with letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since S, U, L are already placed and U/L are fixed).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- We need to test possible letters for positions 1 and 4 using common letters from the remaining pool.\n- **""bulks""** is a strong guess because:\n  - It tests **B** in position 1 and **K** in position 4.\n  - B and K are common letters not yet tested.\n  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, the feedback on B and K will narrow down the possibilities (e.g., if B is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks""; if K is absent, try ""gulps"" or ""hulks"").\n\n<guess>bulks</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: sulky -> FEEDBACK: S(-) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(x)\nGuess 4: bulks -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (we already knew not in 4, and now not in 1), U correct in position 2, L correct in position 3, K and Y absent.
4. ""bulks"" -> B absent, U correct in position 2, L correct in position 3, K absent, S correct in position 5.

So, from ""bulks"":
- U is correct in position 2 (we already knew that).
- L is correct in position 3 (we already knew that).
- S is correct in position 5 (now we know for sure).
- B is absent (so position 1 is not B).
- K is absent (so position 4 is not K).

Therefore, the secret word is: _ U L _ S

We know:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: S
- Position 1: must be a letter not in the eliminated set and not B.
- Position 4: must be a letter not in the eliminated set and not K.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y, and now B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.

We have to choose letter1 and letter4 from the available letters.

We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be B or K (since they are absent) and cannot be the eliminated letters.

So available for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Available for position 4: same, but note that if we use a letter, it cannot be duplicated unless we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""dulks"" - not a word.
- ""fulks"" - not a word.
- ""hulks"" - H in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4? But K is eliminated? From ""bulks"": K is absent, so we cannot use K. So ""hulks"" has K, which is out.

""hulks"" is H1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> but K is eliminated, so invalid.

Similarly, ""pulks"" - P1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> K eliminated.

""julks"" - J1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> K eliminated.

""mulks"" - M eliminated.

""pulps"" - P1,U2,L3,P4,S5 -> but this has P in position 1 and 4? That's possible. But we have to check if P is available. P is not eliminated.

""PULPS"" is a word: P-U-L-P-S.

But in ""pulps"", position 1 is P and position 4 is P. So we are testing P in both positions.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""dulps"" - not a word.

""gulps"" - G1,U2,L3,P4,S5 -> ""gulps"" is a word. And P is available.

Similarly, ""hulmS"" - not a word, and M eliminated.

""pumps"" - M eliminated.

""wulfs"" - W1,U2,L3,F4,S5 -> ""wulfs"" is not a common word? It might be a name or rare. But we can consider.

""bulfs"" - B eliminated.

Not.

""fulks"" - not a word.

""jumps"" - M eliminated.

Not.

""pukes"" - P,U,K,U,E,S -> K and E eliminated.

Not.

So the only common words seem to be ""pulps"" and ""gulps"".

But ""pulps"" has duplicate P, and ""gulps"" has G and P.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But we have to make a guess.

We know the pattern: _ U L _ S

We can try ""gulps"": G in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, P in 4, S in 5.

If we guess ""gulps"", we are testing G and P.

If G is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for G.

If P is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for P.

If not, we get x for G and P.

But since we have only two positions left, we can solve it.

If we are wrong, we get information about G and P.

But we have two possibilities: ""gulps"" or ""pulps""? But ""pulps"" has duplicate P, so if P is not in the word, we know it's ""gulps"".

But let's see if there are more words.

What about ""dulsa""? Not a word.

""huls"" - 4 letters.

""bulks"" we tried, B absent.

Another word: ""hulms"" - not a word, and M eliminated.

""pulmo"" - not matching pattern.

So the only common words are ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can also consider ""jumps"" but M eliminated.

Or ""lumps"" M eliminated.

So we have two candidates: ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can try ""gulps"".

But we have to output.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with H? ""hulks"" but K eliminated.

""hulfs"" - not a word.

""pulks"" not a word.

So it's between ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can try ""gulps"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""gulps"":
- Position 1: G -> if G is in the word and in position 1, ✓; if not, but G is in the word elsewhere, we get dash; if not in word, x.
- Position 4: P -> similarly.

But since we know the pattern, if we get both correct, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""pulps"" (since ""gulps"" would imply G is present but not in position 1, and P in position 4, but if P is correct, then it must be ""pulps"").

But we have to make a guess.

We are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries, so we can try one.

But we can also consider that the word might be ""fulus"" but we know S is in position 5, and ""fulus"" has S in position 5, but it has U in position 2 and 4? F,U,L,U,S -> but we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U. But we don't know if duplicate U is allowed.

However, ""fulus"" is not a common word.

Similarly, ""pulus"" - not a word.

So I think ""gulps"" or ""pulps"" are the only common options.

We can try ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had S present but not in position 1, and now we have S in position 5 correct. Also, in ""sulky"", we had U and L correct.

So for the next guess, we can try ""pulps"".

But we have to output.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with D? ""dulks"" not a word.

""dulsa"" not a word.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's confirm: ""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5.

If we guess this, and if it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""gulps"", because ""gulps"" is the only other common word.

But are there more words?

What about ""hulps""? Not a word.

""julps""? Not a word.

""pulps"" and ""gulps"" are the main ones.

We can also consider ""wulfs"", but it's not standard.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But we have to be careful: if we guess ""pulps"" and it's wrong, then we know it's ""gulps"".

Similarly, if we guess ""gulps"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""pulps"".

But we are on guess 5, and we have one more guess after if needed.

So we can try ""pulps"".

But let's see the pattern: the word must be ? U L ? S.

We have two possibilities: position 1 can be P or G, and position 4 can be P (if duplicate) or S? But S is in position 5, so position 4 cannot be S because we know S is only in position 5? But we don't know if there is another S. However, we have not tested position 4 for S. But we know S is in position 5, so if we put S in position 4, it would be incorrect because we know S is not in position 4 (from ""moist"" feedback: S was in position 4 and got dash, meaning it's not there). So we cannot put S in position 4.

Therefore, for position 4, we must put a letter that is not S and not the eliminated letters.

In ""pulps"", we put P in position 4, which is not S and not eliminated.

Similarly, in ""gulps"", we put P in position 4.

But in ""gulps"", we also have G in position 1.

So both are valid.

We can try ""pulps"".

But to be safe, let's see if there is a word with H.

""hulps"" not a word.

""pulks"" not a word.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's output.

Alternatively, we can think: we have not tested P or G.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G.

But I think it's arbitrary.

Since we have two options, we can choose one.

I'll go with ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know the word is _ U L _ S.

We can also consider that the fourth letter might be a letter we haven't tried.

But we have to guess.

So I'll guess ""pulps"".

But in ""pulps"", we are using P in position 1 and 4. If P is not in the word, then we know it must be ""gulps"".

If P is in the word, then it might be ""pulps"" or ""gulps"", but if we get feedback that P is present, then we have two possibilities, but we can then guess accordingly.

But we are on guess 5, so we can do that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use P or G in position 1? But we have to use one of the two.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G.

But I think it's the same.

Let's look at the available letters: we have to use P or G for position 1, and P for position 4 in one of them, or G for position 4 in the other.

We can try ""pulps"".

But to be systematic, we can choose the one with P in position 4, since we haven't tested P in position 4.

In ""bulks"", we tested K in position 4 and it was absent, so position 4 is not K.

We haven't tested P in position 4 or position 1.

So for guess 5, we can try ""pulps"".

If it's not, then guess 6 for ""gulps"".

But we can also try a word that uses a different letter for position 1 to test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, is there a word with H? ""hulps"" not a word.

""pulis"" - P,U,L,I,S -> I eliminated.

Not.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, and S present, and we know S is in position 5.

So I'll go with ""pulps"".

But in the pattern, we have position 4: in ""pulps"" we put P, but we don't know if P is in the word.

Similarly, in ""gulps"" we put G and P.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""pulps"" is as good as any.

So I'll guess ""pulps"".

But let's output.

Alternatively, we can think: we have not used D, F, W, etc.

But we don't have a word for ""dwelt"" because pattern is fixed.

We must have U in 2, L in 3, S in 5, and position 1 and 4 to be filled.

Another word: ""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> but double U. And U is already in position 2, so if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U. But is ""fulus"" a word? It might be archaic, but we can consider. However, we have to use valid words.

But ""fulus"" is not in common use.

Similarly, ""pulus"" not a word.

So I think we should stick with ""pulps"" or ""gulps"".

I'll choose ""pulps"".

So the guess is ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""pulps"":
- Position 1: P -> if P is in the word and in position 1, ✓; if P is in the word but not position 1, dash; if not, x.
- Position 4: P -> similarly.

But if we get both ✓, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""gulps"".

But if we get position 1 P as x, then we know position 1 is not P, and since we have to use G or P for position 4, if P is absent, then we know position 4 is not P, so it must be ""gulps"" (because ""pulps"" would require P in position 1 and 4, which is not possible if P is absent).

Similarly, if position 4 P is x, then we know position 4 is not P, so it must be ""gulps"".

But if we get position 1 P as dash, then we know P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4? But we are putting P in position 4. If we get dash for P in position 1, that means P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4? But we are also putting P in position 4. If the word is ""pulps"", then P would be in both positions? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

If the word is ""pulps"", then P is in position 1 and 4.

If we guess ""pulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", we win.

If the word is ""gulps"", then when we guess ""pulps"", we would have:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P is not in the word? Then x, because ""gulps"" has G in position 1, so P is not present? Then x for P, and position 4: P vs P? If the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P? But in ""gulps"", position 4 is P, so if we guess ""pulps"", position 4 is P, and if the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so it would be ✓ for position 4? But we also have position 1: P vs G, which is not P, so if P is not in the word, x, and position 4: P is in the word and in position 4, so ✓.

But if the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P not in word? But ""gulps"" has G, so P is not in the word? Then x for P.
- Position 4: P vs P? If the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so ✓ for P? But we are putting P in position 4, and it is correct.

But in ""gulps"", position 4 is P, so if we guess ""pulps"", we have:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P not in word? Because ""gulps"" has G, so P is absent? Then x for P.
- Position 4: P vs P -> if the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so ✓ for P? But we are putting P in position 4, and it is correct.

But if the word is ""pulps"", then when we guess ""pulps"", we get:
- Position 1: P ✓ (because same as word)
- Position 4: P ✓ (because same)

But if the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P x (because G is there)
- Position 4: P ✓ (because P is in position 4)

So we would know it's ""gulps"" because we get x for position 1 and ✓ for position 4? But we have two P's? In ""pulps"", we have P in position 1 and 4. If the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P is not in the word? So x.
- Position 4: P vs P -> same position, so ✓.

But in ""gulps"", position 1 is G, so if we guess ""pulps"", position 1 is P, which is not G, so x, and position 4 is P, which is G in ""gulps"", so ✓.

So we would know it's ""gulps"" for the next guess.

Similarly, if we guess ""pulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", we win.

If we guess ""gulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", then we get:
- Position 1: G vs P -> G not in word? x
- Position 4: P vs P -> ✓
- But position 1 G x, and position 4 P ✓, and we know position 5 S ✓.

Then we know it must be ""pulps"" for the next guess.

So either way, we can solve it in at most two guesses.

But we are on guess 5, so we can do that.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter for position 1 to test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, is there a word with D? ""dulsa"" not a word.

""dulks"" not a word.

""pulis"" has I eliminated.

Not.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know U, L, S are fixed.

We know position 1 must be one of D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we can only use P or G for position 1 in these options.

Similarly for position 4.

But we have two candidates: ""pulps"" and ""gulps"".

We can try ""pulps"".

So I'll go with that.

### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent (x). Eliminated.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, I, T absent (x). Eliminated. S present but not in position 4 (-).
- **Guess 3: sulky** → S present but not in position 1 (-). U correct (✓) in position 2. L correct (✓) in position 3. K and Y absent (x). Eliminated.
- **Guess 4: bulks** → B absent (x). U and L correct (✓) in positions 2 and 3. K absent (x). S correct (✓) in position 5.

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed positions**:
  - Position 2: **U**
  - Position 3: **L**
  - Position 5: **S**
- **Eliminated letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y, B.
- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ U L _ S`.
- **Unknown positions**: 1 and 4 must be filled with letters from the remaining pool: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (since U, L, S are fixed and U/L/S are confirmed).
- **Constraints**:
  - Position 1 cannot be S (from ""sulky"" feedback: S not in position 1).
  - Position 4 cannot be S (from ""moist"" feedback: S not in position 4).
  - Duplicate letters are possible but unconfirmed; no evidence so far.

### Strategy for Guess 5:
- **Goal**: Test possible letters for positions 1 and 4.
- **Candidate words**:
  - `pulps`: P in position 1 and 4.
  - `gulps`: G in position 1 and P in position 4.
- **Why choose one over the other?** 
  - Both are valid 5-letter words fitting the pattern `_ U L _ S`.
  - `pulps` tests P in both positions, while `gulps` tests G in position 1 and P in position 4.
  - Since P is a high-frequency letter, `pulps` is prioritized to solve efficiently:
    - If correct, we win.
    - If incorrect, feedback on P (position 1 and 4) will definitively identify the word:
      - If P is absent (x in either position), the word must be `gulps` (G in position 1 and P in position 4).
      - If P is present but misplaced (dash), it would imply a duplicate letter (e.g., `pulps` if position 4 P is correct but position 1 P is absent—though unlikely due to common words).

### Next Guess: ""pulps""
- Tests P in positions 1 and 4.
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.
- If incorrect, feedback on P will confirm if it's in the word (and if so, whether in position 1 or 4) to guess `gulps` next.

<guess>pulps</guess>",pulps,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""moist"" -> M, O, I, T absent; S present but not in position 4.
3. ""sulky"" -> S present but not in position 1 (we already knew not in 4, and now not in 1), U correct in position 2, L correct in position 3, K and Y absent.
4. ""bulks"" -> B absent, U correct in position 2, L correct in position 3, K absent, S correct in position 5.

So, from ""bulks"":
- U is correct in position 2 (we already knew that).
- L is correct in position 3 (we already knew that).
- S is correct in position 5 (now we know for sure).
- B is absent (so position 1 is not B).
- K is absent (so position 4 is not K).

Therefore, the secret word is: _ U L _ S

We know:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: L
- Position 5: S
- Position 1: must be a letter not in the eliminated set and not B.
- Position 4: must be a letter not in the eliminated set and not K.

Eliminated letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, K, Y, and now B.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form [letter1] U L [letter4] S.

We have to choose letter1 and letter4 from the available letters.

We know letter1 and letter4 cannot be B or K (since they are absent) and cannot be the eliminated letters.

So available for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
Available for position 4: same, but note that if we use a letter, it cannot be duplicated unless we suspect duplicates, but we have no evidence of duplicates so far.

We need to form a valid English word.

Possible words:

- ""dulks"" - not a word.
- ""fulks"" - not a word.
- ""hulks"" - H in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, K in 4? But K is eliminated? From ""bulks"": K is absent, so we cannot use K. So ""hulks"" has K, which is out.

""hulks"" is H1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> but K is eliminated, so invalid.

Similarly, ""pulks"" - P1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> K eliminated.

""julks"" - J1,U2,L3,K4,S5 -> K eliminated.

""mulks"" - M eliminated.

""pulps"" - P1,U2,L3,P4,S5 -> but this has P in position 1 and 4? That's possible. But we have to check if P is available. P is not eliminated.

""PULPS"" is a word: P-U-L-P-S.

But in ""pulps"", position 1 is P and position 4 is P. So we are testing P in both positions.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""dulps"" - not a word.

""gulps"" - G1,U2,L3,P4,S5 -> ""gulps"" is a word. And P is available.

Similarly, ""hulmS"" - not a word, and M eliminated.

""pumps"" - M eliminated.

""wulfs"" - W1,U2,L3,F4,S5 -> ""wulfs"" is not a common word? It might be a name or rare. But we can consider.

""bulfs"" - B eliminated.

Not.

""fulks"" - not a word.

""jumps"" - M eliminated.

Not.

""pukes"" - P,U,K,U,E,S -> K and E eliminated.

Not.

So the only common words seem to be ""pulps"" and ""gulps"".

But ""pulps"" has duplicate P, and ""gulps"" has G and P.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G and P.

But we have to make a guess.

We know the pattern: _ U L _ S

We can try ""gulps"": G in position 1, U in 2, L in 3, P in 4, S in 5.

If we guess ""gulps"", we are testing G and P.

If G is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓ for G.

If P is in the word and in position 4, we get ✓ for P.

If not, we get x for G and P.

But since we have only two positions left, we can solve it.

If we are wrong, we get information about G and P.

But we have two possibilities: ""gulps"" or ""pulps""? But ""pulps"" has duplicate P, so if P is not in the word, we know it's ""gulps"".

But let's see if there are more words.

What about ""dulsa""? Not a word.

""huls"" - 4 letters.

""bulks"" we tried, B absent.

Another word: ""hulms"" - not a word, and M eliminated.

""pulmo"" - not matching pattern.

So the only common words are ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can also consider ""jumps"" but M eliminated.

Or ""lumps"" M eliminated.

So we have two candidates: ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can try ""gulps"".

But we have to output.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with H? ""hulks"" but K eliminated.

""hulfs"" - not a word.

""pulks"" not a word.

So it's between ""gulps"" and ""pulps"".

We can try ""gulps"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""gulps"":
- Position 1: G -> if G is in the word and in position 1, ✓; if not, but G is in the word elsewhere, we get dash; if not in word, x.
- Position 4: P -> similarly.

But since we know the pattern, if we get both correct, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""pulps"" (since ""gulps"" would imply G is present but not in position 1, and P in position 4, but if P is correct, then it must be ""pulps"").

But we have to make a guess.

We are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries, so we can try one.

But we can also consider that the word might be ""fulus"" but we know S is in position 5, and ""fulus"" has S in position 5, but it has U in position 2 and 4? F,U,L,U,S -> but we have U in position 2, and if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U. But we don't know if duplicate U is allowed.

However, ""fulus"" is not a common word.

Similarly, ""pulus"" - not a word.

So I think ""gulps"" or ""pulps"" are the only common options.

We can try ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had S present but not in position 1, and now we have S in position 5 correct. Also, in ""sulky"", we had U and L correct.

So for the next guess, we can try ""pulps"".

But we have to output.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word with D? ""dulks"" not a word.

""dulsa"" not a word.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's confirm: ""pulps"" is P1, U2, L3, P4, S5.

If we guess this, and if it's correct, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""gulps"", because ""gulps"" is the only other common word.

But are there more words?

What about ""hulps""? Not a word.

""julps""? Not a word.

""pulps"" and ""gulps"" are the main ones.

We can also consider ""wulfs"", but it's not standard.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But we have to be careful: if we guess ""pulps"" and it's wrong, then we know it's ""gulps"".

Similarly, if we guess ""gulps"" and it's wrong, then it must be ""pulps"".

But we are on guess 5, and we have one more guess after if needed.

So we can try ""pulps"".

But let's see the pattern: the word must be ? U L ? S.

We have two possibilities: position 1 can be P or G, and position 4 can be P (if duplicate) or S? But S is in position 5, so position 4 cannot be S because we know S is only in position 5? But we don't know if there is another S. However, we have not tested position 4 for S. But we know S is in position 5, so if we put S in position 4, it would be incorrect because we know S is not in position 4 (from ""moist"" feedback: S was in position 4 and got dash, meaning it's not there). So we cannot put S in position 4.

Therefore, for position 4, we must put a letter that is not S and not the eliminated letters.

In ""pulps"", we put P in position 4, which is not S and not eliminated.

Similarly, in ""gulps"", we put P in position 4.

But in ""gulps"", we also have G in position 1.

So both are valid.

We can try ""pulps"".

But to be safe, let's see if there is a word with H.

""hulps"" not a word.

""pulks"" not a word.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's output.

Alternatively, we can think: we have not tested P or G.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G.

But I think it's arbitrary.

Since we have two options, we can choose one.

I'll go with ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know the word is _ U L _ S.

We can also consider that the fourth letter might be a letter we haven't tried.

But we have to guess.

So I'll guess ""pulps"".

But in ""pulps"", we are using P in position 1 and 4. If P is not in the word, then we know it must be ""gulps"".

If P is in the word, then it might be ""pulps"" or ""gulps"", but if we get feedback that P is present, then we have two possibilities, but we can then guess accordingly.

But we are on guess 5, so we can do that.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use P or G in position 1? But we have to use one of the two.

We can try ""gulps"" to test G.

But I think it's the same.

Let's look at the available letters: we have to use P or G for position 1, and P for position 4 in one of them, or G for position 4 in the other.

We can try ""pulps"".

But to be systematic, we can choose the one with P in position 4, since we haven't tested P in position 4.

In ""bulks"", we tested K in position 4 and it was absent, so position 4 is not K.

We haven't tested P in position 4 or position 1.

So for guess 5, we can try ""pulps"".

If it's not, then guess 6 for ""gulps"".

But we can also try a word that uses a different letter for position 1 to test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, is there a word with H? ""hulps"" not a word.

""pulis"" - P,U,L,I,S -> I eliminated.

Not.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback from ""sulky"": we had U and L correct, and S present, and we know S is in position 5.

So I'll go with ""pulps"".

But in the pattern, we have position 4: in ""pulps"" we put P, but we don't know if P is in the word.

Similarly, in ""gulps"" we put G and P.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""pulps"" is as good as any.

So I'll guess ""pulps"".

But let's output.

Alternatively, we can think: we have not used D, F, W, etc.

But we don't have a word for ""dwelt"" because pattern is fixed.

We must have U in 2, L in 3, S in 5, and position 1 and 4 to be filled.

Another word: ""fulus"" - F,U,L,U,S -> but double U. And U is already in position 2, so if we put U in position 4, that would be a duplicate U. But is ""fulus"" a word? It might be archaic, but we can consider. However, we have to use valid words.

But ""fulus"" is not in common use.

Similarly, ""pulus"" not a word.

So I think we should stick with ""pulps"" or ""gulps"".

I'll choose ""pulps"".

So the guess is ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""pulps"":
- Position 1: P -> if P is in the word and in position 1, ✓; if P is in the word but not position 1, dash; if not, x.
- Position 4: P -> similarly.

But if we get both ✓, we win.

If not, then we know it must be ""gulps"".

But if we get position 1 P as x, then we know position 1 is not P, and since we have to use G or P for position 4, if P is absent, then we know position 4 is not P, so it must be ""gulps"" (because ""pulps"" would require P in position 1 and 4, which is not possible if P is absent).

Similarly, if position 4 P is x, then we know position 4 is not P, so it must be ""gulps"".

But if we get position 1 P as dash, then we know P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4? But we are putting P in position 4. If we get dash for P in position 1, that means P is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 4? But we are also putting P in position 4. If the word is ""pulps"", then P would be in both positions? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

If the word is ""pulps"", then P is in position 1 and 4.

If we guess ""pulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", we win.

If the word is ""gulps"", then when we guess ""pulps"", we would have:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P is not in the word? Then x, because ""gulps"" has G in position 1, so P is not present? Then x for P, and position 4: P vs P? If the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P? But in ""gulps"", position 4 is P, so if we guess ""pulps"", position 4 is P, and if the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so it would be ✓ for position 4? But we also have position 1: P vs G, which is not P, so if P is not in the word, x, and position 4: P is in the word and in position 4, so ✓.

But if the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P not in word? But ""gulps"" has G, so P is not in the word? Then x for P.
- Position 4: P vs P? If the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so ✓ for P? But we are putting P in position 4, and it is correct.

But in ""gulps"", position 4 is P, so if we guess ""pulps"", we have:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P not in word? Because ""gulps"" has G, so P is absent? Then x for P.
- Position 4: P vs P -> if the word is ""gulps"", then position 4 is P, so ✓ for P? But we are putting P in position 4, and it is correct.

But if the word is ""pulps"", then when we guess ""pulps"", we get:
- Position 1: P ✓ (because same as word)
- Position 4: P ✓ (because same)

But if the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P x (because G is there)
- Position 4: P ✓ (because P is in position 4)

So we would know it's ""gulps"" because we get x for position 1 and ✓ for position 4? But we have two P's? In ""pulps"", we have P in position 1 and 4. If the word is ""gulps"", then:
- Position 1: P vs G -> P is not in the word? So x.
- Position 4: P vs P -> same position, so ✓.

But in ""gulps"", position 1 is G, so if we guess ""pulps"", position 1 is P, which is not G, so x, and position 4 is P, which is G in ""gulps"", so ✓.

So we would know it's ""gulps"" for the next guess.

Similarly, if we guess ""pulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", we win.

If we guess ""gulps"" and the word is ""pulps"", then we get:
- Position 1: G vs P -> G not in word? x
- Position 4: P vs P -> ✓
- But position 1 G x, and position 4 P ✓, and we know position 5 S ✓.

Then we know it must be ""pulps"" for the next guess.

So either way, we can solve it in at most two guesses.

But we are on guess 5, so we can do that.

We can also try a word that uses a different letter for position 1 to test more letters? But we are constrained by the pattern.

For example, is there a word with D? ""dulsa"" not a word.

""dulks"" not a word.

""pulis"" has I eliminated.

Not.

So I think we should guess ""pulps"".

But let's see the feedback we have.

We know U, L, S are fixed.

We know position 1 must be one of D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, but we can only use P or G for position 1 in these options.

Similarly for position 4.

But we have two candidates: ""pulps"" and ""gulps"".

We can try ""pulps"".

So I'll go with that.
