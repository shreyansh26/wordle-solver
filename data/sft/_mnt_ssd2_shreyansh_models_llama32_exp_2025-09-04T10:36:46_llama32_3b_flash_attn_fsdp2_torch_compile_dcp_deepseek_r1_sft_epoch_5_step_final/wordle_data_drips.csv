We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has R in the second position and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has S, T, or other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words with R in the second position:

Let's think of 5-letter words with R as the second letter and without C, A, N, E.

Examples:
- BRICK (but C is not allowed, so avoid C)
- BRISK (S and I are new, and no forbidden letters)
- BRUTE (U and T are new)
- PRISM (P, I, S, M)
- TRYST (T, Y, S, T) but Y is less common

We should avoid using any of the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

Let me list some words that fit:
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> R is second, and letters are B, I, S, K which are new.
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M -> R second, and P, I, S, M are new.
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> R second, and T, I, P, S are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (A and E are out).

We can try a word that has I and O or U.

For example:
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D -> but O and U are vowels, and D is common.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P -> but G is less common.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N, E.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, which are very common.

Word: TRUST -> T, R, U, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's T, R, U, S, T -> so T appears twice. But that's acceptable if the word allows.

However, we don't know if T is in the word or not. We can try.

But let's avoid repeated letters for now to get more information.

Better: BRISK -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K. R is fixed so we are testing B, I, S, K.

Similarly, PRISM -> P, R, I, S, M.

I think BRISK is a good candidate because it has S and I, which are common.

Another option: SHIRT -> S, H, I, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? We need R in the second position.

So, we must have the second letter as R.

Therefore, SHIRT is not acceptable because R is fourth.

We need words with pattern: _ R _ _ _

Let me think: BRICK (invalid because of C), BRISK, BRUTE, DRINK (D and K), but D and K are less common? 

DRINK: D, R, I, N, K -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word from first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, we cannot use A, C, N, E.

So, avoiding A, C, N, E.

Possible words:
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> no forbidden letters.
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M -> no forbidden letters.
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> no forbidden letters.
- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> but G is less common.

I think BRISK or PRISM are good.

Let's choose BRISK because it has S and I, and S is a very common letter.

So, second guess: BRISK

We'll get feedback on B, I, S, K.

But note: we already know R is correct and in position 2, so we don't need to test R again.

We are only testing the other positions.

So, let's go with BRISK.

<guess>brisk</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- The word does not contain C, A, N, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, P, M) to gather more information.

For the second guess, I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position, maintaining the known correct letter.
- It introduces new common letters: B, I, S, K, which are not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).
- Testing S and I (vowels) is strategic since they are high-frequency letters.

This guess will help identify if any of B, I, S, or K are in the word and their positions.

Possible words with R in the second position:

Let's think of 5-letter words with R as the second letter and without C, A, N, E.

Examples:
- BRICK (but C is not allowed, so avoid C)
- BRISK (S and I are new, and no forbidden letters)
- BRUTE (U and T are new)

Let me think of a word that has S and T, which are very common.

Word: TRUST -> T, R, U, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's T, R, U, S, T -> so T appears twice. But that's acceptable if the word allows.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""brisk""
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R, which we already knew)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word has the form: _ R I _ _
   - Because R is in position 2 and I is in position 3 (both confirmed correct).

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, K (from the x's)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position: S (from the second guess, S is marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position).

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- The fourth letter is not S (because S is in the word but not in the fourth position).
- The word contains S, but S must be in one of the positions: 1, 5, or possibly 4? But wait, the feedback for S is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I).

Also, we know the word does not contain: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _ and includes S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 4 and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).

Additionally, we need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test possible letters for the remaining positions.

Let's break down the possibilities:

- Position 1: can be any letter except the forbidden ones (A,B,C,E,K,N) and must be a letter we haven't tried yet or that we know is in the word (but we don't know much about other letters yet).
- Position 4: must be a letter that is not S (because if S were in position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). Also, it cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 5: similarly, must be a letter not S and not forbidden.

But note: S is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not S, and positions 2 and 3 are R and I, which are fixed).

So, the word is either:
- S R I _ _ (if S is in position 1) or
- _ R I S _ (if S is in position 5)

But wait, we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we need to test both possibilities? Actually, we can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters to test.

We also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: R, I, S, and two more letters (since it's 5 letters).

We have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.

But let's assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.

So, the word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), and two more letters.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

Possible words:

First, if S is in position 1: then the word is S R I _ _
We need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not forbidden and not S (if no duplicates). But S is already used in position 1, so the other positions can be other letters.

But we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we can try to guess a word that has S in position 1 and then other new letters, or in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5 to test that possibility.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5, but that would be invalid because we know S must be in 1 or 5. So we must include S in either position 1 or position 5.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Available letters: all others.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: S in position 1: S R I _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These must be from the available set and not forbidden.

Possible words: 
- SRIL? Not a word.
- SRIM? Not a word.
- SRIL? No.
- How about ""SRIL"" is not English. 
- ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden (we know K is not in the word from guess2). 
- ""SHRIM"" - is that a word? Shrimp is 6 letters. 
- ""SHRUB"" - but that has B (forbidden) and U. But B is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid forbidden letters.

Try ""SRIS"" - but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""SHRIG"" - not common, and G is new. But is it valid? SHRIG is not a standard word.
- ""SHRIM"" - again, 5 letters? Shrimp is 6. Shrim is 5? No, shrim is not a word. 
- ""SHRIP"" - not a word.

What about ""STRIP""? 
- S T R I P -> but that has T in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So ""STRIP"" is S T R I P -> positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). But we need R in position 2 and I in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: S R I _ _

So, first letter S, second R, third I.

Then positions 4 and 5: we need two letters that form a valid word.

Possible words:
- ""SRIS"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SHRIK"" - but K is forbidden and H is new? ""Shrik"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a valid word.

This is difficult. Maybe S is not in position 1.

Now, try S in position 5: so pattern _ R I _ S

Then, position 1 is some letter, position 4 is some letter, and position 5 is S.

We know position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""brisk"": S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there, so position 4 is not S). But we are putting S in position 5, which is fine.

Now, position 1 and 4 need to be filled.

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S -> but we know from guess1 that E is not in the word, but T is new. However, in ""trips"", the fourth letter is P and fifth is S. But we have to check if T is allowed? T is not forbidden. And P is not forbidden.

But wait, ""trips"" has S in the fifth position? Yes.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: A,B,C,E,K,N. T and P are not in that list, so they are allowed.

But is ""trips"" a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIPS"" - G R I P S. G and P are new.

Or ""DRIPS"" - D R I P S.

But we don't know if D is allowed.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but we used that? No, we didn't. But in guess2 we used ""brisk"", not ""prism"". But ""prism"" has P, R, I, S, M. But we know from guess2 that S is in the word but not in position 4. In ""prism"", S is in position 4? Let's see: P-R-I-S-M -> position 4 is S. But in the feedback for ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning that S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to test if S is in position 5.

In ""prism"", S is in position 4, which we know is wrong for S, so we shouldn't put S in position 4 again because we already know it's not there. So ""prism"" would be a bad choice because it has S in position 4.

We need a word with S in position 5.

So, pattern: _ R I _ S

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden (from guess1).
- FRISK: F R I S K -> but K is forbidden (from guess2: K is x). So no.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but S is in position 4? In ""prism"", the letters are P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so this word would have S in position 4, which is invalid (we know S is not in position 4). So we cannot use ""prism"" because it forces S into position 4.

We need a word that ends with S in position 5.

So, words ending with ""RIS"" and then S? Actually, the pattern is: letter1, R, I, letter4, S.

So, words like:
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- DRIPS: D, R, I, P, S -> 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- WRIST: W R I S T -> but that has S in position 4? W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so we cannot use ""wrist"" because it has S in position 4.

We need S in position 5, so the word must end with S? No, position 5 is S, but the word has five letters: so the fourth letter is followed by S.

So, the word must be ? R I ? S

Now, what words are there?

- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden.
- FRISP: not a word.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but that has S in position 4? In ""prism"", the S is in position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But note: in the pattern for ""prism"", the S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4, so we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So, we need a word that has S in position 5, so the fourth letter is not S.

Therefore, ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"" are candidates.

But we also need to consider that we might have other letters.

Another word: ""TRISY"" - not a word.
""GRISly"" - not 5 letters.

Common words: trips, grips, drips.

We can also consider ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden.

Or ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

So, let's choose between ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"".

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""trips"": letters T, R, I, P, S. R and I are known, S is known to be in the word (we are testing position 5 for S). T and P are new.

Similarly, ""grips"": G, R, I, P, S -> G and P new.

""drips"": D, R, I, P, S -> D and P.

We don't know which one is better. But we can also consider that we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we know S is in the word and not in position 4. So if we put S in position 5, and if it is correct, we get it. If not, then S must be in position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, and 4 is not allowed, so only position 1 left).

But we don't have to fix S in this guess? We can test both possibilities by choosing a word that has S in position 5, and if it's wrong, then we know S must be in position 1.

But we can also test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that.

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.

If S in position 1: S R I _ _

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid.

Possible:
- ""SRIL"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIG"" - not standard.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a word.
- ""SHRIK"" - not a word and K forbidden.
- ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

What about ""SHIRE""? But E is forbidden (from guess1). And E is not allowed.

""SHIRT"": S H I R T -> but that has H and T. But the pattern is S R I _ _, so position 2 must be R, which in ""shirt"" is position 4? No, ""shirt"" is S-H-I-R-T -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:T. But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So that doesn't match.

We need the pattern: 1:S, 2:R, 3:I, 4:?, 5:?

So, words like:
- ""SERIF"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""SIRUP"" - S I R U P -> but that has I in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So position 2 must be R, so ""sirup"" is S-I-R-U-P -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:R, ... so position 2 is I, not R. So no.

Another: ""SPRIG"" - S P R I G -> but that has R in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So position 2 is P, not R. So no.

It seems there are not many common words with the pattern S R I _ _.

Perhaps ""SHRIK"" is not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe S is not in position 1? Then it must be in position 5.

So, let's focus on words with pattern _ R I _ S

As I said earlier: trips, grips, drips, etc.

But also: ""FRISK"" is not possible because K is forbidden and S is in position 4? ""frisk"" is F-R-I-S-K -> S in position 4, which we know is wrong.

""BRISK"" we already tried.

Another word: ""TRIPS"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""DRIPS"" or ""grips"".

Now, to choose between them, we can pick one that uses common letters.

But we also want to test new letters.

We have not tried: D, G, T, P, etc.

If we guess ""trips"", we test T and P.

If we guess ""grips"", we test G and P.

Similarly, ""drips"" tests D and P.

Since we know S is in the word, and we are testing it in position 5, if we get S correct, we know its position. If not, then S must be in position 1.

But we don't have many options for S in position 1? So maybe test S in position 5 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5? But we know S must be in 1 or 5, so we have to put it in one of them.

But we can put it in position 5 and see.

Let me check if there are words with S in position 1: I can't think of a common one. So probably S is in position 5.

Therefore, let's choose a word with pattern _ R I _ S.

Now, which one? ""trips"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters. ""trips"" has T, R, I, P, S. T and P are new, and not forbidden.

Similarly, ""grips"" has G, R, I, P, S. G is new.

""drips"" has D, R, I, P, S. D is new.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but S is in position 4, which we know is wrong, so avoid.

Another word: ""SHRIS"" is not valid.

So, let's choose ""trips"" to test T and P.

But we have to make sure that we are not using forbidden letters. T and P are allowed.

So, guess: ""trips""

But let's see what feedback we might get.

If the word is ""trips"", then we get it right? But we don't know.

If not, we get feedback on T, P, and S.

But S is in position 5, and we know S is in the word, so if it's not in position 5, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a word for that.

But we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that, but we couldn't find a common word.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has S in position 1, but we need a valid word. What about ""SHRIS""? Not valid.

Perhaps ""SHRI"" is not 5 letters.

I think it's more likely that S is in position 5.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to consider that the word might be ""drips"" or ""grips"".

We can also think of other words: ""PRISM"" is invalid because of S in position 4.

What about ""TRIPS""? That's the same as ""trips"".

Another word: ""WRIST"" but S is in position 4? W-R-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong.

So, no.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" but C is forbidden.

So, ""trips"" seems a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""trips"":
- Position 1: T -> if T is in the word and correct, we get ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x.
- Position 2: R -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 3: I -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: P -> feedback will tell us if P is in the word and if in position 4.
- Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so if it's in position 5, we get ✓, else if it's in position 1, we get - (since it's in the word but wrong position), but we know position 1 is T in this guess? If we guess ""trips"", position 1 is T.

But if the word has S in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which would be wrong, so we get S marked as - (if S is in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which is not the correct position for S, so it would be marked as - meaning S is in the word but not in position 5, so then S must be in position 1).

Similarly, if we get S marked as ✓, then it's in position 5.

So, by guessing ""trips"", we can determine the position of S.

Moreover, we test T and P.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to make sure that T and P are not forbidden? They are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,K,N. So T and P are allowed.

Therefore, I choose ""trips"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T R I P S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S.

We know position 2 and 3 are R and I, so they will be ✓.

Position 1: T -> we don't know if T is in the word and if it's in position 1.
Position 4: P -> similarly.
Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so it will be either ✓ (if in position 5) or - (if in position 1).

So, we can get valuable feedback.

We might also consider ""drips"" or ""grips"" to test different letters.

But ""trips"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""trips"".

<guess>trips</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), K(x)  
  - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - B and K are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I _ _` (R in position 2, I in position 3).  
- S is in the word but cannot be in position 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, P, D, G, M) to gather more information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of S: Since S must be in position 1 or 5, we can prioritize a word that places S in position 5 to verify its location. If S is marked as correct (✓) in position 5, it confirms S is in position 5. If marked as (-), it means S must be in position 1.  
- Use new high-frequency letters (T, P) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and the incorrect position for S (position 4).  

The word **""trips""** fits perfectly:  
- Pattern: `T R I P S` (position 2: R, position 3: I, position 5: S).  
- Tests S in position 5 (if S is here, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - and S must be in position 1).  
- Introduces T (position 1) and P (position 4), both new and common letters.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, B, C, E, K, N).  

This guess will help resolve the position of S and test two new letters (T and P).  

<guess>trips</guess>",trips,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""brisk""
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R, which we already knew)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word has the form: _ R I _ _
   - Because R is in position 2 and I is in position 3 (both confirmed correct).

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, K (from the x's)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position: S (from the second guess, S is marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position).

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- The fourth letter is not S (because S is in the word but not in the fourth position).
- The word contains S, but S must be in one of the positions: 1, 5, or possibly 4? But wait, the feedback for S is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I).

Also, we know the word does not contain: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _ and includes S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 4 and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).

Additionally, we need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test possible letters for the remaining positions.

Let's break down the possibilities:

- Position 1: can be any letter except the forbidden ones (A,B,C,E,K,N) and must be a letter we haven't tried yet or that we know is in the word (but we don't know much about other letters yet).
- Position 4: must be a letter that is not S (because if S were in position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). Also, it cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 5: similarly, must be a letter not S and not forbidden.

But note: S is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not S, and positions 2 and 3 are R and I, which are fixed).

So, the word is either:
- S R I _ _ (if S is in position 1) or
- _ R I S _ (if S is in position 5)

But wait, we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we need to test both possibilities? Actually, we can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters to test.

We also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: R, I, S, and two more letters (since it's 5 letters).

We have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.

But let's assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.

So, the word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), and two more letters.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

Possible words:

First, if S is in position 1: then the word is S R I _ _
We need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not forbidden and not S (if no duplicates). But S is already used in position 1, so the other positions can be other letters.

But we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we can try to guess a word that has S in position 1 and then other new letters, or in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5 to test that possibility.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5, but that would be invalid because we know S must be in 1 or 5. So we must include S in either position 1 or position 5.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Available letters: all others.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: S in position 1: S R I _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These must be from the available set and not forbidden.

Possible words: 
- SRIL? Not a word.
- SRIM? Not a word.
- SRIL? No.
- How about ""SRIL"" is not English. 
- ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden (we know K is not in the word from guess2). 
- ""SHRIM"" - is that a word? Shrimp is 6 letters. 
- ""SHRUB"" - but that has B (forbidden) and U. But B is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid forbidden letters.

Try ""SRIS"" - but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""SHRIG"" - not common, and G is new. But is it valid? SHRIG is not a standard word.
- ""SHRIM"" - again, 5 letters? Shrimp is 6. Shrim is 5? No, shrim is not a word. 
- ""SHRIP"" - not a word.

What about ""STRIP""? 
- S T R I P -> but that has T in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So ""STRIP"" is S T R I P -> positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). But we need R in position 2 and I in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: S R I _ _

So, first letter S, second R, third I.

Then positions 4 and 5: we need two letters that form a valid word.

Possible words:
- ""SRIS"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SHRIK"" - but K is forbidden and H is new? ""Shrik"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a valid word.

This is difficult. Maybe S is not in position 1.

Now, try S in position 5: so pattern _ R I _ S

Then, position 1 is some letter, position 4 is some letter, and position 5 is S.

We know position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""brisk"": S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there, so position 4 is not S). But we are putting S in position 5, which is fine.

Now, position 1 and 4 need to be filled.

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S -> but we know from guess1 that E is not in the word, but T is new. However, in ""trips"", the fourth letter is P and fifth is S. But we have to check if T is allowed? T is not forbidden. And P is not forbidden.

But wait, ""trips"" has S in the fifth position? Yes.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: A,B,C,E,K,N. T and P are not in that list, so they are allowed.

But is ""trips"" a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIPS"" - G R I P S. G and P are new.

Or ""DRIPS"" - D R I P S.

But we don't know if D is allowed.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but we used that? No, we didn't. But in guess2 we used ""brisk"", not ""prism"". But ""prism"" has P, R, I, S, M. But we know from guess2 that S is in the word but not in position 4. In ""prism"", S is in position 4? Let's see: P-R-I-S-M -> position 4 is S. But in the feedback for ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning that S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to test if S is in position 5.

In ""prism"", S is in position 4, which we know is wrong for S, so we shouldn't put S in position 4 again because we already know it's not there. So ""prism"" would be a bad choice because it has S in position 4.

We need a word with S in position 5.

So, pattern: _ R I _ S

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden (from guess1).
- FRISK: F R I S K -> but K is forbidden (from guess2: K is x). So no.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but S is in position 4? In ""prism"", the letters are P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so this word would have S in position 4, which is invalid (we know S is not in position 4). So we cannot use ""prism"" because it forces S into position 4.

We need a word that ends with S in position 5.

So, words ending with ""RIS"" and then S? Actually, the pattern is: letter1, R, I, letter4, S.

So, words like:
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- DRIPS: D, R, I, P, S -> 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- WRIST: W R I S T -> but that has S in position 4? W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so we cannot use ""wrist"" because it has S in position 4.

We need S in position 5, so the word must end with S? No, position 5 is S, but the word has five letters: so the fourth letter is followed by S.

So, the word must be ? R I ? S

Now, what words are there?

- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden.
- FRISP: not a word.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but that has S in position 4? In ""prism"", the S is in position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But note: in the pattern for ""prism"", the S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4, so we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So, we need a word that has S in position 5, so the fourth letter is not S.

Therefore, ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"" are candidates.

But we also need to consider that we might have other letters.

Another word: ""TRISY"" - not a word.
""GRISly"" - not 5 letters.

Common words: trips, grips, drips.

We can also consider ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden.

Or ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

So, let's choose between ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"".

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""trips"": letters T, R, I, P, S. R and I are known, S is known to be in the word (we are testing position 5 for S). T and P are new.

Similarly, ""grips"": G, R, I, P, S -> G and P new.

""drips"": D, R, I, P, S -> D and P.

We don't know which one is better. But we can also consider that we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we know S is in the word and not in position 4. So if we put S in position 5, and if it is correct, we get it. If not, then S must be in position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, and 4 is not allowed, so only position 1 left).

But we don't have to fix S in this guess? We can test both possibilities by choosing a word that has S in position 5, and if it's wrong, then we know S must be in position 1.

But we can also test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that.

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.

If S in position 1: S R I _ _

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid.

Possible:
- ""SRIL"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIG"" - not standard.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a word.
- ""SHRIK"" - not a word and K forbidden.
- ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

What about ""SHIRE""? But E is forbidden (from guess1). And E is not allowed.

""SHIRT"": S H I R T -> but that has H and T. But the pattern is S R I _ _, so position 2 must be R, which in ""shirt"" is position 4? No, ""shirt"" is S-H-I-R-T -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:T. But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So that doesn't match.

We need the pattern: 1:S, 2:R, 3:I, 4:?, 5:?

So, words like:
- ""SERIF"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""SIRUP"" - S I R U P -> but that has I in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So position 2 must be R, so ""sirup"" is S-I-R-U-P -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:R, ... so position 2 is I, not R. So no.

Another: ""SPRIG"" - S P R I G -> but that has R in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So position 2 is P, not R. So no.

It seems there are not many common words with the pattern S R I _ _.

Perhaps ""SHRIK"" is not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe S is not in position 1? Then it must be in position 5.

So, let's focus on words with pattern _ R I _ S

As I said earlier: trips, grips, drips, etc.

But also: ""FRISK"" is not possible because K is forbidden and S is in position 4? ""frisk"" is F-R-I-S-K -> S in position 4, which we know is wrong.

""BRISK"" we already tried.

Another word: ""TRIPS"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""DRIPS"" or ""grips"".

Now, to choose between them, we can pick one that uses common letters.

But we also want to test new letters.

We have not tried: D, G, T, P, etc.

If we guess ""trips"", we test T and P.

If we guess ""grips"", we test G and P.

Similarly, ""drips"" tests D and P.

Since we know S is in the word, and we are testing it in position 5, if we get S correct, we know its position. If not, then S must be in position 1.

But we don't have many options for S in position 1? So maybe test S in position 5 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5? But we know S must be in 1 or 5, so we have to put it in one of them.

But we can put it in position 5 and see.

Let me check if there are words with S in position 1: I can't think of a common one. So probably S is in position 5.

Therefore, let's choose a word with pattern _ R I _ S.

Now, which one? ""trips"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters. ""trips"" has T, R, I, P, S. T and P are new, and not forbidden.

Similarly, ""grips"" has G, R, I, P, S. G is new.

""drips"" has D, R, I, P, S. D is new.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but S is in position 4, which we know is wrong, so avoid.

Another word: ""SHRIS"" is not valid.

So, let's choose ""trips"" to test T and P.

But we have to make sure that we are not using forbidden letters. T and P are allowed.

So, guess: ""trips""

But let's see what feedback we might get.

If the word is ""trips"", then we get it right? But we don't know.

If not, we get feedback on T, P, and S.

But S is in position 5, and we know S is in the word, so if it's not in position 5, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a word for that.

But we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that, but we couldn't find a common word.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has S in position 1, but we need a valid word. What about ""SHRIS""? Not valid.

Perhaps ""SHRI"" is not 5 letters.

I think it's more likely that S is in position 5.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to consider that the word might be ""drips"" or ""grips"".

We can also think of other words: ""PRISM"" is invalid because of S in position 4.

What about ""TRIPS""? That's the same as ""trips"".

Another word: ""WRIST"" but S is in position 4? W-R-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong.

So, no.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" but C is forbidden.

So, ""trips"" seems a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""trips"":
- Position 1: T -> if T is in the word and correct, we get ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x.
- Position 2: R -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 3: I -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: P -> feedback will tell us if P is in the word and if in position 4.
- Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so if it's in position 5, we get ✓, else if it's in position 1, we get - (since it's in the word but wrong position), but we know position 1 is T in this guess? If we guess ""trips"", position 1 is T.

But if the word has S in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which would be wrong, so we get S marked as - (if S is in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which is not the correct position for S, so it would be marked as - meaning S is in the word but not in position 5, so then S must be in position 1).

Similarly, if we get S marked as ✓, then it's in position 5.

So, by guessing ""trips"", we can determine the position of S.

Moreover, we test T and P.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to make sure that T and P are not forbidden? They are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,K,N. So T and P are allowed.

Therefore, I choose ""trips"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T R I P S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S.

We know position 2 and 3 are R and I, so they will be ✓.

Position 1: T -> we don't know if T is in the word and if it's in position 1.
Position 4: P -> similarly.
Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so it will be either ✓ (if in position 5) or - (if in position 1).

So, we can get valuable feedback.

We might also consider ""drips"" or ""grips"" to test different letters.

But ""trips"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""trips"".

<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), K(x)  
  - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - B and K are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I _ _` (R in position 2, I in position 3).  
- S is in the word but cannot be in position 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, P, D, G, M) to gather more information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of S: Since S must be in position 1 or 5, we can prioritize a word that places S in position 5 to verify its location. If S is marked as correct (✓) in position 5, it confirms S is in position 5. If marked as (-), it means S must be in position 1.  
- Use new high-frequency letters (T, P) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and the incorrect position for S (position 4).  

The word **""trips""** fits perfectly:  
- Pattern: `T R I P S` (position 2: R, position 3: I, position 5: S).  
- Tests S in position 5 (if S is here, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - and S must be in position 1).  
- Introduces T (position 1) and P (position 4), both new and common letters.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, B, C, E, K, N).  

This guess will help resolve the position of S and test two new letters (T and P).",Guess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has R in the second position and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has S, T, or other common consonants and vowels.

Possible words with R in the second position:

Let's think of 5-letter words with R as the second letter and without C, A, N, E.

Examples:
- BRICK (but C is not allowed, so avoid C)
- BRISK (S and I are new, and no forbidden letters)
- BRUTE (U and T are new)
- PRISM (P, I, S, M)
- TRYST (T, Y, S, T) but Y is less common

We should avoid using any of the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

Let me list some words that fit:
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> R is second, and letters are B, I, S, K which are new.
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M -> R second, and P, I, S, M are new.
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> R second, and T, I, P, S are new.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Another idea: since we know R is fixed in position 2, we can try to cover more vowels or common consonants.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (A and E are out).

We can try a word that has I and O or U.

For example:
- PROUD: P, R, O, U, D -> but O and U are vowels, and D is common.
- GROUP: G, R, O, U, P -> but G is less common.

But note: we must avoid A, C, N, E.

Let me think of a word that has S and T, which are very common.

Word: TRUST -> T, R, U, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, it's T, R, U, S, T -> so T appears twice. But that's acceptable if the word allows.

However, we don't know if T is in the word or not. We can try.

But let's avoid repeated letters for now to get more information.

Better: BRISK -> distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K. R is fixed so we are testing B, I, S, K.

Similarly, PRISM -> P, R, I, S, M.

I think BRISK is a good candidate because it has S and I, which are common.

Another option: SHIRT -> S, H, I, R, T -> but R is in the fourth position? We need R in the second position.

So, we must have the second letter as R.

Therefore, SHIRT is not acceptable because R is fourth.

We need words with pattern: _ R _ _ _

Let me think: BRICK (invalid because of C), BRISK, BRUTE, DRINK (D and K), but D and K are less common? 

DRINK: D, R, I, N, K -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word from first guess). So we cannot use N.

Similarly, we cannot use A, C, N, E.

So, avoiding A, C, N, E.

Possible words:
- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> no forbidden letters.
- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M -> no forbidden letters.
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> no forbidden letters.
- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> but G is less common.

I think BRISK or PRISM are good.

Let's choose BRISK because it has S and I, and S is a very common letter.

So, second guess: BRISK

We'll get feedback on B, I, S, K.

But note: we already know R is correct and in position 2, so we don't need to test R again.

We are only testing the other positions.

So, let's go with BRISK.

<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- The word does not contain C, A, N, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, P, M) to gather more information.

For the second guess, I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It has R in the second position, maintaining the known correct letter.
- It introduces new common letters: B, I, S, K, which are not yet tested.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).
- Testing S and I (vowels) is strategic since they are high-frequency letters.

This guess will help identify if any of B, I, S, or K are in the word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""brisk""
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R, which we already knew)
- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- K: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word has the form: _ R I _ _
   - Because R is in position 2 and I is in position 3 (both confirmed correct).

2. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, K (from the x's)
   - So, we must avoid these letters.

3. Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position: S (from the second guess, S is marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position).

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R I _ _
- The fourth letter is not S (because S is in the word but not in the fourth position).
- The word contains S, but S must be in one of the positions: 1, 5, or possibly 4? But wait, the feedback for S is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I).

Also, we know the word does not contain: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _ and includes S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 4 and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).

Additionally, we need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

We have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test possible letters for the remaining positions.

Let's break down the possibilities:

- Position 1: can be any letter except the forbidden ones (A,B,C,E,K,N) and must be a letter we haven't tried yet or that we know is in the word (but we don't know much about other letters yet).
- Position 4: must be a letter that is not S (because if S were in position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it's not). Also, it cannot be any of the forbidden letters.
- Position 5: similarly, must be a letter not S and not forbidden.

But note: S is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not S, and positions 2 and 3 are R and I, which are fixed).

So, the word is either:
- S R I _ _ (if S is in position 1) or
- _ R I S _ (if S is in position 5)

But wait, we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we need to test both possibilities? Actually, we can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.

Alternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters to test.

We also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: R, I, S, and two more letters (since it's 5 letters).

We have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.

But let's assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.

So, the word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), and two more letters.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

Possible words:

First, if S is in position 1: then the word is S R I _ _
We need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not forbidden and not S (if no duplicates). But S is already used in position 1, so the other positions can be other letters.

But we don't know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we can try to guess a word that has S in position 1 and then other new letters, or in position 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5 to test that possibility.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5, but that would be invalid because we know S must be in 1 or 5. So we must include S in either position 1 or position 5.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.

Available letters: all others.

Common letters we haven't tried: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's try to form words:

Option 1: S in position 1: S R I _ _
We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These must be from the available set and not forbidden.

Possible words: 
- SRIL? Not a word.
- SRIM? Not a word.
- SRIL? No.
- How about ""SRIL"" is not English. 
- ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden (we know K is not in the word from guess2). 
- ""SHRIM"" - is that a word? Shrimp is 6 letters. 
- ""SHRUB"" - but that has B (forbidden) and U. But B is forbidden, so no.

We need to avoid forbidden letters.

Try ""SRIS"" - but that's 4 letters? We need 5.

5-letter words: 
- ""SHRIG"" - not common, and G is new. But is it valid? SHRIG is not a standard word.
- ""SHRIM"" - again, 5 letters? Shrimp is 6. Shrim is 5? No, shrim is not a word. 
- ""SHRIP"" - not a word.

What about ""STRIP""? 
- S T R I P -> but that has T in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So ""STRIP"" is S T R I P -> positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). But we need R in position 2 and I in position 3. So that doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: S R I _ _

So, first letter S, second R, third I.

Then positions 4 and 5: we need two letters that form a valid word.

Possible words:
- ""SRIS"" is 4 letters, not 5.
- ""SHRIK"" - but K is forbidden and H is new? ""Shrik"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a valid word.

This is difficult. Maybe S is not in position 1.

Now, try S in position 5: so pattern _ R I _ S

Then, position 1 is some letter, position 4 is some letter, and position 5 is S.

We know position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""brisk"": S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it's in the word but not there, so position 4 is not S). But we are putting S in position 5, which is fine.

Now, position 1 and 4 need to be filled.

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S -> but we know from guess1 that E is not in the word, but T is new. However, in ""trips"", the fourth letter is P and fifth is S. But we have to check if T is allowed? T is not forbidden. And P is not forbidden.

But wait, ""trips"" has S in the fifth position? Yes.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: A,B,C,E,K,N. T and P are not in that list, so they are allowed.

But is ""trips"" a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""GRIPS"" - G R I P S. G and P are new.

Or ""DRIPS"" - D R I P S.

But we don't know if D is allowed.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but we used that? No, we didn't. But in guess2 we used ""brisk"", not ""prism"". But ""prism"" has P, R, I, S, M. But we know from guess2 that S is in the word but not in position 4. In ""prism"", S is in position 4? Let's see: P-R-I-S-M -> position 4 is S. But in the feedback for ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning that S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to test if S is in position 5.

In ""prism"", S is in position 4, which we know is wrong for S, so we shouldn't put S in position 4 again because we already know it's not there. So ""prism"" would be a bad choice because it has S in position 4.

We need a word with S in position 5.

So, pattern: _ R I _ S

Possible words:
- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden (from guess1).
- FRISK: F R I S K -> but K is forbidden (from guess2: K is x). So no.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but S is in position 4? In ""prism"", the letters are P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so this word would have S in position 4, which is invalid (we know S is not in position 4). So we cannot use ""prism"" because it forces S into position 4.

We need a word that ends with S in position 5.

So, words ending with ""RIS"" and then S? Actually, the pattern is: letter1, R, I, letter4, S.

So, words like:
- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- DRIPS: D, R, I, P, S -> 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S
- WRIST: W R I S T -> but that has S in position 4? W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so we cannot use ""wrist"" because it has S in position 4.

We need S in position 5, so the word must end with S? No, position 5 is S, but the word has five letters: so the fourth letter is followed by S.

So, the word must be ? R I ? S

Now, what words are there?

- TRIPS: T R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- CRISP: but C is forbidden.
- FRISP: not a word.
- PRISM: P R I S M -> but that has S in position 4? In ""prism"", the S is in position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.

But note: in the pattern for ""prism"", the S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4, so we should avoid putting S in position 4.

So, we need a word that has S in position 5, so the fourth letter is not S.

Therefore, ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"" are candidates.

But we also need to consider that we might have other letters.

Another word: ""TRISY"" - not a word.
""GRISly"" - not 5 letters.

Common words: trips, grips, drips.

We can also consider ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden.

Or ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

So, let's choose between ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"".

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

In ""trips"": letters T, R, I, P, S. R and I are known, S is known to be in the word (we are testing position 5 for S). T and P are new.

Similarly, ""grips"": G, R, I, P, S -> G and P new.

""drips"": D, R, I, P, S -> D and P.

We don't know which one is better. But we can also consider that we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we know S is in the word and not in position 4. So if we put S in position 5, and if it is correct, we get it. If not, then S must be in position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, and 4 is not allowed, so only position 1 left).

But we don't have to fix S in this guess? We can test both possibilities by choosing a word that has S in position 5, and if it's wrong, then we know S must be in position 1.

But we can also test other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that.

But let's list possible words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.

If S in position 1: S R I _ _

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid.

Possible:
- ""SRIL"" is not a word.
- ""SHRIG"" - not standard.
- ""SHRIM"" - not a word.
- ""SHRIK"" - not a word and K forbidden.
- ""SHRIS"" - not a word.

What about ""SHIRE""? But E is forbidden (from guess1). And E is not allowed.

""SHIRT"": S H I R T -> but that has H and T. But the pattern is S R I _ _, so position 2 must be R, which in ""shirt"" is position 4? No, ""shirt"" is S-H-I-R-T -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:T. But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So that doesn't match.

We need the pattern: 1:S, 2:R, 3:I, 4:?, 5:?

So, words like:
- ""SERIF"" - but E is forbidden.
- ""SIRUP"" - S I R U P -> but that has I in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So position 2 must be R, so ""sirup"" is S-I-R-U-P -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:R, ... so position 2 is I, not R. So no.

Another: ""SPRIG"" - S P R I G -> but that has R in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So position 2 is P, not R. So no.

It seems there are not many common words with the pattern S R I _ _.

Perhaps ""SHRIK"" is not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe S is not in position 1? Then it must be in position 5.

So, let's focus on words with pattern _ R I _ S

As I said earlier: trips, grips, drips, etc.

But also: ""FRISK"" is not possible because K is forbidden and S is in position 4? ""frisk"" is F-R-I-S-K -> S in position 4, which we know is wrong.

""BRISK"" we already tried.

Another word: ""TRIPS"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""DRIPS"" or ""grips"".

Now, to choose between them, we can pick one that uses common letters.

But we also want to test new letters.

We have not tried: D, G, T, P, etc.

If we guess ""trips"", we test T and P.

If we guess ""grips"", we test G and P.

Similarly, ""drips"" tests D and P.

Since we know S is in the word, and we are testing it in position 5, if we get S correct, we know its position. If not, then S must be in position 1.

But we don't have many options for S in position 1? So maybe test S in position 5 first.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have S in position 1 or 5? But we know S must be in 1 or 5, so we have to put it in one of them.

But we can put it in position 5 and see.

Let me check if there are words with S in position 1: I can't think of a common one. So probably S is in position 5.

Therefore, let's choose a word with pattern _ R I _ S.

Now, which one? ""trips"" is a common word.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters. ""trips"" has T, R, I, P, S. T and P are new, and not forbidden.

Similarly, ""grips"" has G, R, I, P, S. G is new.

""drips"" has D, R, I, P, S. D is new.

We can also consider ""PRISM"" but S is in position 4, which we know is wrong, so avoid.

Another word: ""SHRIS"" is not valid.

So, let's choose ""trips"" to test T and P.

But we have to make sure that we are not using forbidden letters. T and P are allowed.

So, guess: ""trips""

But let's see what feedback we might get.

If the word is ""trips"", then we get it right? But we don't know.

If not, we get feedback on T, P, and S.

But S is in position 5, and we know S is in the word, so if it's not in position 5, then it must be in position 1, but we don't have a word for that.

But we are testing position 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that, but we couldn't find a common word.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has S in position 1, but we need a valid word. What about ""SHRIS""? Not valid.

Perhaps ""SHRI"" is not 5 letters.

I think it's more likely that S is in position 5.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to consider that the word might be ""drips"" or ""grips"".

We can also think of other words: ""PRISM"" is invalid because of S in position 4.

What about ""TRIPS""? That's the same as ""trips"".

Another word: ""WRIST"" but S is in position 4? W-R-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong.

So, no.

Perhaps ""CRISP"" but C is forbidden.

So, ""trips"" seems a good candidate.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""trips"":
- Position 1: T -> if T is in the word and correct, we get ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x.
- Position 2: R -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 3: I -> ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: P -> feedback will tell us if P is in the word and if in position 4.
- Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so if it's in position 5, we get ✓, else if it's in position 1, we get - (since it's in the word but wrong position), but we know position 1 is T in this guess? If we guess ""trips"", position 1 is T.

But if the word has S in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which would be wrong, so we get S marked as - (if S is in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which is not the correct position for S, so it would be marked as - meaning S is in the word but not in position 5, so then S must be in position 1).

Similarly, if we get S marked as ✓, then it's in position 5.

So, by guessing ""trips"", we can determine the position of S.

Moreover, we test T and P.

So, let's go with ""trips"".

But we have to make sure that T and P are not forbidden? They are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden: A,B,C,E,K,N. So T and P are allowed.

Therefore, I choose ""trips"".

But let's confirm the pattern: T R I P S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S.

We know position 2 and 3 are R and I, so they will be ✓.

Position 1: T -> we don't know if T is in the word and if it's in position 1.
Position 4: P -> similarly.
Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so it will be either ✓ (if in position 5) or - (if in position 1).

So, we can get valuable feedback.

We might also consider ""drips"" or ""grips"" to test different letters.

But ""trips"" is a common word.

So, I'll go with ""trips"".

<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), K(x)  
  - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  
  - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - B and K are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I _ _` (R in position 2, I in position 3).  
- S is in the word but cannot be in position 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.  
- Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.  
- We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, P, D, G, M) to gather more information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of S: Since S must be in position 1 or 5, we can prioritize a word that places S in position 5 to verify its location. If S is marked as correct (✓) in position 5, it confirms S is in position 5. If marked as (-), it means S must be in position 1.  
- Use new high-frequency letters (T, P) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters and the incorrect position for S (position 4).  

The word **""trips""** fits perfectly:  
- Pattern: `T R I P S` (position 2: R, position 3: I, position 5: S).  
- Tests S in position 5 (if S is here, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - and S must be in position 1).  
- Introduces T (position 1) and P (position 4), both new and common letters.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, B, C, E, K, N).  

This guess will help resolve the position of S and test two new letters (T and P).

So we cannot use N.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use A, C, N, E.\n\nSo, avoiding A, C, N, E.\n\nPossible words:\n- BRISK: B, R, I, S, K -> no forbidden letters.\n- PRISM: P, R, I, S, M -> no forbidden letters.\n- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> no forbidden letters.\n- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> but G is less common.\n\nI think BRISK or PRISM are good.\n\nLet\'s choose BRISK because it has S and I, and S is a very common letter.\n\nSo, second guess: BRISK\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on B, I, S, K.\n\nBut note: we already know R is correct and in position 2, so we don\'t need to test R again.\n\nWe are only testing the other positions.\n\nSo, let\'s go with BRISK.\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked with ""✓"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _\n- The word does not contain C, A, N, or E.\n- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, O, B, P, M) to gather more information.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""brisk"" because:\n- It has R in the second position, maintaining the known correct letter.\n- It introduces new common letters: B, I, S, K, which are not yet tested.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).\n- Testing S and I (vowels) is strategic since they are high-frequency letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of B, I, S, or K are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so the second letter is R)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""brisk""\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R, which we already knew)\n- I: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is I)\n- S: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- K: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The word has the form: _ R I _ _\n   - Because R is in position 2 and I is in position 3 (both confirmed correct).\n\n2. Letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, K (from the x\'s)\n   - So, we must avoid these letters.\n\n3. Letters that are in the word but not in the correct position: S (from the second guess, S is marked as ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position).\n\nTherefore, the word is of the form: _ R I _ _\n- The fourth letter is not S (because S is in the word but not in the fourth position).\n- The word contains S, but S must be in one of the positions: 1, 5, or possibly 4? But wait, the feedback for S is ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in the fourth position. So S must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 2 and 3 are taken by R and I).\n\nAlso, we know the word does not contain: A, B, C, E, K, N.\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that fits the pattern _ R I _ _ and includes S in either position 1 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 4 and positions 2 and 3 are fixed).\n\nAdditionally, we need to avoid the forbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can use this guess to test possible letters for the remaining positions.\n\nLet\'s break down the possibilities:\n\n- Position 1: can be any letter except the forbidden ones (A,B,C,E,K,N) and must be a letter we haven\'t tried yet or that we know is in the word (but we don\'t know much about other letters yet).\n- Position 4: must be a letter that is not S (because if S were in position 4, it would have been marked as correct, but it\'s not). Also, it cannot be any of the forbidden letters.\n- Position 5: similarly, must be a letter not S and not forbidden.\n\nBut note: S is in the word, so it must be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not S, and positions 2 and 3 are R and I, which are fixed).\n\nSo, the word is either:\n- S R I _ _ (if S is in position 1) or\n- _ R I S _ (if S is in position 5)\n\nBut wait, we don\'t know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we need to test both possibilities? Actually, we can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to guess a word that fits one of these patterns and uses new letters to test.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly the letters we know so far: R, I, S, and two more letters (since it\'s 5 letters).\n\nWe have to consider that the word might have repeated letters? But so far, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates. However, we cannot rule it out.\n\nBut let\'s assume no duplicates for now to keep it simple.\n\nSo, the word has: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (somewhere, not pos4), and two more letters.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\nFirst, if S is in position 1: then the word is S R I _ _\nWe need to fill the last two positions with letters that are not forbidden and not S (if no duplicates). But S is already used in position 1, so the other positions can be other letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S is in position 1 or 5. So we can try to guess a word that has S in position 1 and then other new letters, or in position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has S in position 5 to test that possibility.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t have S in position 1 or 5, but that would be invalid because we know S must be in 1 or 5. So we must include S in either position 1 or position 5.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nForbidden letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.\n\nAvailable letters: all others.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nOption 1: S in position 1: S R I _ _\nWe need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. These must be from the available set and not forbidden.\n\nPossible words: \n- SRIL? Not a word.\n- SRIM? Not a word.\n- SRIL? No.\n- How about ""SRIL"" is not English. \n- ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden (we know K is not in the word from guess2). \n- ""SHRIM"" - is that a word? Shrimp is 6 letters. \n- ""SHRUB"" - but that has B (forbidden) and U. But B is forbidden, so no.\n\nWe need to avoid forbidden letters.\n\nTry ""SRIS"" - but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5.\n\n5-letter words: \n- ""SHRIG"" - not common, and G is new. But is it valid? SHRIG is not a standard word.\n- ""SHRIM"" - again, 5 letters? Shrimp is 6. Shrim is 5? No, shrim is not a word. \n- ""SHRIP"" - not a word.\n\nWhat about ""STRIP""? \n- S T R I P -> but that has T in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So ""STRIP"" is S T R I P -> positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). But we need R in position 2 and I in position 3. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: S R I _ _\n\nSo, first letter S, second R, third I.\n\nThen positions 4 and 5: we need two letters that form a valid word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""SRIS"" is 4 letters, not 5.\n- ""SHRIK"" - but K is forbidden and H is new? ""Shrik"" is not a word.\n- ""SHRIM"" - not a valid word.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe S is not in position 1.\n\nNow, try S in position 5: so pattern _ R I _ S\n\nThen, position 1 is some letter, position 4 is some letter, and position 5 is S.\n\nWe know position 4 cannot be S (from feedback of ""brisk"": S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning it\'s in the word but not there, so position 4 is not S). But we are putting S in position 5, which is fine.\n\nNow, position 1 and 4 need to be filled.\n\nPossible words:\n- TRIPS: T R I P S -> but we know from guess1 that E is not in the word, but T is new. However, in ""trips"", the fourth letter is P and fifth is S. But we have to check if T is allowed? T is not forbidden. And P is not forbidden.\n\nBut wait, ""trips"" has S in the fifth position? Yes.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters: A,B,C,E,K,N. T and P are not in that list, so they are allowed.\n\nBut is ""trips"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""GRIPS"" - G R I P S. G and P are new.\n\nOr ""DRIPS"" - D R I P S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is allowed.\n\nWe can also consider ""PRISM"" but we used that? No, we didn\'t. But in guess2 we used ""brisk"", not ""prism"". But ""prism"" has P, R, I, S, M. But we know from guess2 that S is in the word but not in position 4. In ""prism"", S is in position 4? Let\'s see: P-R-I-S-M -> position 4 is S. But in the feedback for ""brisk"", S was in position 4 and got ""-"", meaning that S is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it would be wrong. But we are trying to test if S is in position 5.\n\nIn ""prism"", S is in position 4, which we know is wrong for S, so we shouldn\'t put S in position 4 again because we already know it\'s not there. So ""prism"" would be a bad choice because it has S in position 4.\n\nWe need a word with S in position 5.\n\nSo, pattern: _ R I _ S\n\nPossible words:\n- TRIPS: T R I P S\n- GRIPS: G R I P S\n- DRIPS: D R I P S\n- CRISP: but C is forbidden (from guess1).\n- FRISK: F R I S K -> but K is forbidden (from guess2: K is x). So no.\n- PRISM: P R I S M -> but S is in position 4? In ""prism"", the letters are P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so this word would have S in position 4, which is invalid (we know S is not in position 4). So we cannot use ""prism"" because it forces S into position 4.\n\nWe need a word that ends with S in position 5.\n\nSo, words ending with ""RIS"" and then S? Actually, the pattern is: letter1, R, I, letter4, S.\n\nSo, words like:\n- TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S\n- GRIPS: G, R, I, P, S -> 1:G, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S\n- DRIPS: D, R, I, P, S -> 1:D, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S\n- WRIST: W R I S T -> but that has S in position 4? W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But we know S is not in position 4, so we cannot use ""wrist"" because it has S in position 4.\n\nWe need S in position 5, so the word must end with S? No, position 5 is S, but the word has five letters: so the fourth letter is followed by S.\n\nSo, the word must be ? R I ? S\n\nNow, what words are there?\n\n- TRIPS: T R I P S\n- GRIPS: G R I P S\n- DRIPS: D R I P S\n- CRISP: but C is forbidden.\n- FRISP: not a word.\n- PRISM: P R I S M -> but that has S in position 4? In ""prism"", the S is in position 4, which we know is wrong. So we cannot use that.\n\nBut note: in the pattern for ""prism"", the S is in position 4, but we know S is not in position 4, so we should avoid putting S in position 4.\n\nSo, we need a word that has S in position 5, so the fourth letter is not S.\n\nTherefore, ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"" are candidates.\n\nBut we also need to consider that we might have other letters.\n\nAnother word: ""TRISY"" - not a word.\n""GRISly"" - not 5 letters.\n\nCommon words: trips, grips, drips.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHRIK"" but K is forbidden.\n\nOr ""SHRIS"" - not a word.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""trips"", ""grips"", ""drips"".\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nIn ""trips"": letters T, R, I, P, S. R and I are known, S is known to be in the word (we are testing position 5 for S). T and P are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""grips"": G, R, I, P, S -> G and P new.\n\n""drips"": D, R, I, P, S -> D and P.\n\nWe don\'t know which one is better. But we can also consider that we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: we know S is in the word and not in position 4. So if we put S in position 5, and if it is correct, we get it. If not, then S must be in position 1 (since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, and 4 is not allowed, so only position 1 left).\n\nBut we don\'t have to fix S in this guess? We can test both possibilities by choosing a word that has S in position 5, and if it\'s wrong, then we know S must be in position 1.\n\nBut we can also test other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.\n\nIf S in position 1: S R I _ _\n\nWe need two letters for positions 4 and 5. The word must be valid.\n\nPossible:\n- ""SRIL"" is not a word.\n- ""SHRIG"" - not standard.\n- ""SHRIM"" - not a word.\n- ""SHRIK"" - not a word and K forbidden.\n- ""SHRIS"" - not a word.\n\nWhat about ""SHIRE""? But E is forbidden (from guess1). And E is not allowed.\n\n""SHIRT"": S H I R T -> but that has H and T. But the pattern is S R I _ _, so position 2 must be R, which in ""shirt"" is position 4? No, ""shirt"" is S-H-I-R-T -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:T. But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So that doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need the pattern: 1:S, 2:R, 3:I, 4:?, 5:?\n\nSo, words like:\n- ""SERIF"" - but E is forbidden.\n- ""SIRUP"" - S I R U P -> but that has I in position 2? No, we need R in position 2. So position 2 must be R, so ""sirup"" is S-I-R-U-P -> 1:S, 2:I, 3:R, ... so position 2 is I, not R. So no.\n\nAnother: ""SPRIG"" - S P R I G -> but that has R in position 3? S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5). But we need position 2 to be R and position 3 to be I. So position 2 is P, not R. So no.\n\nIt seems there are not many common words with the pattern S R I _ _.\n\nPerhaps ""SHRIK"" is not valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe S is not in position 1? Then it must be in position 5.\n\nSo, let\'s focus on words with pattern _ R I _ S\n\nAs I said earlier: trips, grips, drips, etc.\n\nBut also: ""FRISK"" is not possible because K is forbidden and S is in position 4? ""frisk"" is F-R-I-S-K -> S in position 4, which we know is wrong.\n\n""BRISK"" we already tried.\n\nAnother word: ""TRIPS"" is one option.\n\nBut we can also consider ""DRIPS"" or ""grips"".\n\nNow, to choose between them, we can pick one that uses common letters.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nWe have not tried: D, G, T, P, etc.\n\nIf we guess ""trips"", we test T and P.\n\nIf we guess ""grips"", we test G and P.\n\nSimilarly, ""drips"" tests D and P.\n\nSince we know S is in the word, and we are testing it in position 5, if we get S correct, we know its position. If not, then S must be in position 1.\n\nBut we don\'t have many options for S in position 1? So maybe test S in position 5 first.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have S in position 1 or 5? But we know S must be in 1 or 5, so we have to put it in one of them.\n\nBut we can put it in position 5 and see.\n\nLet me check if there are words with S in position 1: I can\'t think of a common one. So probably S is in position 5.\n\nTherefore, let\'s choose a word with pattern _ R I _ S.\n\nNow, which one? ""trips"" is a common word.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters. ""trips"" has T, R, I, P, S. T and P are new, and not forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""grips"" has G, R, I, P, S. G is new.\n\n""drips"" has D, R, I, P, S. D is new.\n\nWe can also consider ""PRISM"" but S is in position 4, which we know is wrong, so avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""SHRIS"" is not valid.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""trips"" to test T and P.\n\nBut we have to make sure that we are not using forbidden letters. T and P are allowed.\n\nSo, guess: ""trips""\n\nBut let\'s see what feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""trips"", then we get it right? But we don\'t know.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on T, P, and S.\n\nBut S is in position 5, and we know S is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 5, then it must be in position 1, but we don\'t have a word for that.\n\nBut we are testing position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S in position 1 to test that, but we couldn\'t find a common word.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has S in position 1, but we need a valid word. What about ""SHRIS""? Not valid.\n\nPerhaps ""SHRI"" is not 5 letters.\n\nI think it\'s more likely that S is in position 5.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""trips"".\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might be ""drips"" or ""grips"".\n\nWe can also think of other words: ""PRISM"" is invalid because of S in position 4.\n\nWhat about ""TRIPS""? That\'s the same as ""trips"".\n\nAnother word: ""WRIST"" but S is in position 4? W-R-I-S-T -> position 4 is S, which we know is wrong.\n\nSo, no.\n\nPerhaps ""CRISP"" but C is forbidden.\n\nSo, ""trips"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""trips"":\n- Position 1: T -> if T is in the word and correct, we get ✓, else if in word but wrong position, -, else x.\n- Position 2: R -> ✓ (we know)\n- Position 3: I -> ✓ (we know)\n- Position 4: P -> feedback will tell us if P is in the word and if in position 4.\n- Position 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so if it\'s in position 5, we get ✓, else if it\'s in position 1, we get - (since it\'s in the word but wrong position), but we know position 1 is T in this guess? If we guess ""trips"", position 1 is T.\n\nBut if the word has S in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which would be wrong, so we get S marked as - (if S is in position 1, then in ""trips"", S is in position 5, which is not the correct position for S, so it would be marked as - meaning S is in the word but not in position 5, so then S must be in position 1).\n\nSimilarly, if we get S marked as ✓, then it\'s in position 5.\n\nSo, by guessing ""trips"", we can determine the position of S.\n\nMoreover, we test T and P.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""trips"".\n\nBut we have to make sure that T and P are not forbidden? They are not in the forbidden list.\n\nForbidden: A,B,C,E,K,N. So T and P are allowed.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""trips"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: T R I P S -> positions: 1:T, 2:R, 3:I, 4:P, 5:S.\n\nWe know position 2 and 3 are R and I, so they will be ✓.\n\nPosition 1: T -> we don\'t know if T is in the word and if it\'s in position 1.\nPosition 4: P -> similarly.\nPosition 5: S -> we know S is in the word, so it will be either ✓ (if in position 5) or - (if in position 1).\n\nSo, we can get valuable feedback.\n\nWe might also consider ""drips"" or ""grips"" to test different letters.\n\nBut ""trips"" is a common word.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""trips"".\n\n<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(-), K(x)  \n  - I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).  \n  - S is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - B and K are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I _ _` (R in position 2, I in position 3).  \n- S is in the word but cannot be in position 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.  \n- Excluded letters: A, B, C, E, K, N.  \n- We need to test new common letters (e.g., T, P, D, G, M) to gather more information.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test the position of S: Since S must be in position 1 or 5, we can prioritize a word that places S in position 5 to verify its location. If S is marked as correct (✓) in position 5, it confirms S is in position 5. If marked as (-), it means S must be in position 1.  \n- Use new high-frequency letters (T, P) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid excluded letters and the incorrect position for S (position 4).  \n\nThe word **""trips""** fits perfectly:  \n- Pattern: `T R I P S` (position 2: R, position 3: I, position 5: S).  \n- Tests S in position 5 (if S is here, it will be ✓; if not, it will be - and S must be in position 1).  \n- Introduces T (position 1) and P (position 4), both new and common letters.  \n- Avoids all excluded letters (A, B, C, E, K, N).  \n\nThis guess will help resolve the position of S and test two new letters (T and P).\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(-) K(x)\nGuess 3: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(✓) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""brisk""
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- K: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""trips""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter I)
- P: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter P)
- S: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter S)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word has the form: _ R I P S
   - Positions: 2=R, 3=I, 4=P, 5=S
   - So the word ends with ""RIPS"" and the first letter is unknown.

2. We know the first letter is not: C, A, N, E, B, K, T (from the x's in the feedback).

3. We know the word contains S, but now we also know its exact position (fifth letter), which matches the feedback from ""brisk"" that S is in the word but not in position 4 (and now we see it's in position 5).

4. Additionally, from ""brisk"", we knew S was in the word but not in position 4, and now we know it's in position 5.

Now, the word is of the form: ? R I P S

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""RIPS"". The first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and not used in the word yet (except for the fixed R, I, P, S).

Excluded letters so far: A, B, C, E, K, N, T (from the x's in all guesses).

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, T, P.

So, available letters for the first position: any letter not in {A, B, C, E, K, N, T, P} and not R, I, P, S (but R, I, P, S are already in the word, so they can't be the first letter unless duplicated, but we don't have evidence of duplicates).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, we should consider that the first letter is a new letter.

The word is ""? R I P S"".

We need a word that matches this pattern.

Possible words:
- DRIPS: but D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. Excluded: A,B,C,E,K,N,T,B? B is excluded from guess2? In guess2, B was x, so not in the word. So B is excluded.

Excluded: A, B, C, E, K, N, T.

So, D, G, H, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible for the first letter.

Now, common words ending with ""RIPS"":
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- PRIPS: not a word, and P is already in the word? But we can't have P in the first position because it would be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates, so it's possible but less likely.

But let's check: if the word is ""DRIPS"", then D is the first letter, which is new.

Similarly, ""GRIPS"" has G.

We can also consider ""WRIPS""? Not a word.

Or ""HRIPS""? Not a word.

Common words: drips, grips, trips? But trips we tried and T is excluded.

We tried ""trips"" and T is excluded, so it's not the word.

Now, ""drips"" and ""grips"" are both valid words.

We have feedback that in guess3, we got T(x) and S(✓), and P(✓). But note, in ""trips"", we have P and S, and they were correct, so that matches.

But we need to find the first letter.

In ""drips"", the first letter is D, which we haven't tested.

Similarly, in ""grips"", it's G.

We can choose either.

But we need to make a guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one.

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

We can guess one of them.

But let's see if we can get more information? Actually, we don't need to get more information about other letters because we already have four letters fixed and one unknown.

The word is either ""drips"" or ""grips"".

We can guess one of them.

But we have to choose.

Alternatively, we can think if there are other possibilities? What about ""HRIPS""? Not a word.

Or ""CRIPS""? C is excluded.

So, only two real possibilities: ""drips"" and ""grips"".

We can guess ""drips"".

But let's see the feedback from guess3: in ""trips"", we got T(x) and S(✓), P(✓). But note, in ""trips"", the first letter T is not in the word, and S and P are correct.

Now, if the word were ""drips"", then in ""trips"", we have:
- T: not in the word (x) -> correct, because ""drips"" has D, not T.
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (in ""drips"", P is in position 4, so ✓)
- S: ✓ (in ""drips"", S is in position 5, so ✓)

So that matches for ""drips"".

Similarly, if the word is ""grips"", then for ""trips"":
- T: x (not in ""grips"")
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓

So both are consistent.

Therefore, we cannot distinguish between ""drips"" and ""grips"" based on guess3.

We need to test the first letter.

But we have two options: ""drips"" and ""grips"". We can guess one of them.

Since we are on the fourth guess, we can guess ""drips"".

If it's not, then the next guess would be ""grips"".

But we have two guesses left? Total 6, we are on guess 4, so two more after this.

So, let's guess ""drips"".

But we can also consider if there are other words? What about ""WRIPS""? Not a word.

Or ""SHIPS""? But that would be S H I P S -> but then position 2 is H, not R. We need position 2 to be R, so ""ships"" is S-H-I-P-S, which doesn't match.

Another: ""DRIPS"" is one option.

So, I think only two possibilities.

We can also check: is ""drips"" a word? Yes, meaning small drops or a faucet.

Similarly, ""grips"" is a word, meaning a type of grip or to grip.

Now, to decide: we can choose ""drips"" because D is a common letter.

But G is also common.

We can flip a coin, but let's think strategically. We have two guesses left, so we can afford to guess one of them.

Since we have no information about D or G, we can guess ""drips"".

But note: in guess2, we had ""brisk"" and S was marked as - (in the word but wrong position). Now we know S is in position 5, which is consistent.

Similarly, for ""drips"": positions: 1=D, 2=R, 3=I, 4=P, 5=S.

We haven't tested D before.

Similarly, for ""grips"": G(1), R(2), I(3), P(4), S(5).

We haven't tested G.

So, we can guess ""drips"".

But let's see the feedback from guess3: we have P and S correct in positions 4 and 5. So the word ends with P S, and the first letter is missing.

We can also consider if there are other words? What about ""GRIPS""? That's the same as ""grips"".

Or ""PRIPS""? Not a word.

So, only two.

Therefore, I'll guess ""drips"".

But we must ensure that D is not excluded. It is not in the excluded list.

So, <guess>drips</guess>

But let's double-check the pattern: in ""drips"", we have:
- D: new letter, not tested.
- R, I, P, S: known to be in the word and in the correct positions.

So, if D is correct, we win. If not, then we know it's ""grips"".

But we have two guesses left, so it's safe.

We could also consider ""grips"" to test G.

But we don't have a preference.

Alternatively, we can think: in guess2, we had ""brisk"" and S was marked as - (wrong position), and now we know S is in position 5. So that's consistent.

Similarly for ""drips"".

So, I'll go with ""drips"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- The secret word has the pattern: `_ R I P S` (positions 2–5 are confirmed: R, I, P, S).
- Excluded letters (not in the word): A, B, C, E, K, N, T (from ""x"" marks in feedback).
- The first letter must be a 5-letter word starting with a letter not excluded and not used in contradiction. Possible candidates include ""drips"" or ""grips"", as both fit the pattern and avoid excluded letters.

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test ""drips"" to resolve between the two candidates. If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, the word must be ""grips"" (since only two possibilities exist).

This guess efficiently narrows down the solution space with minimal attempts.

<guess>drips</guess>",drips,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""brisk""
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter I)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- K: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""trips""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter R)
- I: ✓ (correct position, third letter I)
- P: ✓ (correct position, fourth letter P)
- S: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter S)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word has the form: _ R I P S
   - Positions: 2=R, 3=I, 4=P, 5=S
   - So the word ends with ""RIPS"" and the first letter is unknown.

2. We know the first letter is not: C, A, N, E, B, K, T (from the x's in the feedback).

3. We know the word contains S, but now we also know its exact position (fifth letter), which matches the feedback from ""brisk"" that S is in the word but not in position 4 (and now we see it's in position 5).

4. Additionally, from ""brisk"", we knew S was in the word but not in position 4, and now we know it's in position 5.

Now, the word is of the form: ? R I P S

We need to find a 5-letter word that ends with ""RIPS"". The first letter must be a letter that is not excluded and not used in the word yet (except for the fixed R, I, P, S).

Excluded letters so far: A, B, C, E, K, N, T (from the x's in all guesses).

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, B, I, S, K, T, P.

So, available letters for the first position: any letter not in {A, B, C, E, K, N, T, P} and not R, I, P, S (but R, I, P, S are already in the word, so they can't be the first letter unless duplicated, but we don't have evidence of duplicates).

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, since we have no indication of duplicates, we should consider that the first letter is a new letter.

The word is ""? R I P S"".

We need a word that matches this pattern.

Possible words:
- DRIPS: but D is not excluded? D is not in the excluded list. Excluded: A,B,C,E,K,N,T,B? B is excluded from guess2? In guess2, B was x, so not in the word. So B is excluded.

Excluded: A, B, C, E, K, N, T.

So, D, G, H, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are possible for the first letter.

Now, common words ending with ""RIPS"":
- DRIPS: D R I P S
- GRIPS: G R I P S
- PRIPS: not a word, and P is already in the word? But we can't have P in the first position because it would be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates, so it's possible but less likely.

But let's check: if the word is ""DRIPS"", then D is the first letter, which is new.

Similarly, ""GRIPS"" has G.

We can also consider ""WRIPS""? Not a word.

Or ""HRIPS""? Not a word.

Common words: drips, grips, trips? But trips we tried and T is excluded.

We tried ""trips"" and T is excluded, so it's not the word.

Now, ""drips"" and ""grips"" are both valid words.

We have feedback that in guess3, we got T(x) and S(✓), and P(✓). But note, in ""trips"", we have P and S, and they were correct, so that matches.

But we need to find the first letter.

In ""drips"", the first letter is D, which we haven't tested.

Similarly, in ""grips"", it's G.

We can choose either.

But we need to make a guess. Since we have two possibilities, we can pick one.

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess.

The word is either ""drips"" or ""grips"".

We can guess one of them.

But we have to choose.

Alternatively, we can think if there are other possibilities? What about ""HRIPS""? Not a word.

We can guess ""drips"".

But let's see the feedback from guess3: in ""trips"", we got T(x) and S(✓), P(✓). But note, in ""trips"", the first letter T is not in the word, and S and P are correct.

Now, if the word were ""drips"", then in ""trips"", we have:
- T: not in the word (x) -> correct, because ""drips"" has D, not T.
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓ (in ""drips"", P is in position 4, so ✓)
- S: ✓ (in ""drips"", S is in position 5, so ✓)

So that matches for ""drips"".

Similarly, if the word is ""grips"", then for ""trips"":
- T: x (not in ""grips"")
- R: ✓
- I: ✓
- P: ✓
- S: ✓

So both are consistent.

Therefore, we cannot distinguish between ""drips"" and ""grips"" based on guess3.

We need to test the first letter.

We haven't tested D before.

Similarly, for ""grips"": G(1), R(2), I(3), P(4), S(5).

We haven't tested G.

So, we can guess ""drips"".

But let's see the feedback from guess3: we have P and S correct in positions 4 and 5. So the word ends with P S, and the first letter is missing.

We can also consider if there are other words? What about ""GRIPS""? That's the same as ""grips"".
