We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We can eliminate any word that contains C, R, or N.
 Also, the word must contain A and E.

 Since A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, we need to try a word that places A and E in different positions.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, N.
 - Contains A and E.
 - Places A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants that we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters, and also includes A and E in new positions.

 Let's try to put A in a different position, say position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we know E is not at position 5, so E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must avoid the positions that we know are wrong for A and E.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's try the word ""SLATE"", but note:
 - S: we don't know about S.
 - L: we don't know about L.
 - A: we know A is in the word, but in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3. However, our feedback said A is not at position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice because it puts A at position 3.

 We need a word that has A and E, and avoids C, R, N, and places A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Let's try ""STALE"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We need to put A in a position that is not 3. Let's try position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" but that has D, I, U and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AISLE"":
 - A at position 1 (which is new)
 - I at position 2
 - S at position 3
 - L at position 4
 - E at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try ""AEGIS"": 
 - A at position 1
 - E at position 2
 - G at position 3
 - I at position 4
 - S at position 5

 But note: we don't know if G, I, S are in the word. Also, we are testing new letters.

 However, we must avoid the known incorrect positions: 
   For A: we know it's not at 3 -> we are putting it at 1, which is okay.
   For E: we know it's not at 5 -> we are putting it at 2, which is okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at 3, and E is in the word but not at 5. So ""AEGIS"" is a valid try? 

 However, we are not sure if the word has G, I, S. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters and avoids the known absent letters.

 Another idea: ""SAUTE""
 - S at 1
 - A at 2 (new position for A)
 - U at 3
 - T at 4
 - E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at 5.

 Let's try ""STEAL"":
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - E at 3
 - A at 4
 - L at 5

 This way:
   A is at position 4 (not 3) -> okay
   E is at position 3 (not 5) -> okay

 And we test S, T, L.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, L. This is a good way to test them.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STEAL"" is a valid English word.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at position 4, which is different. So that's good.

 Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that's good.

 Let's go with ""STEAL"".

 However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

 But let me check: we are using S, T, E, A, L. We know A and E are in the word, and S, T, L are new.

 This is a good way to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES""
 - T at 1
 - A at 2
 - L at 3
 - E at 4
 - S at 5

 This puts A at 2 (not 3) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's acceptable.

 But note: we are trying to maximize information. ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has A and E, and we are testing three new letters (S, T, L) in ""STEAL"" and two new letters (T, L, S) in ""TALES"". Actually, both test 3 new letters.

 But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can choose either. Let's go with ""STEAL"" because it uses common letters.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the word).
- **A** cannot be in position 3, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** at position 4 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 3 (not 5).
- Tests **S, T, L** (new letters).
- Excludes **C, R, N**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We can eliminate any word that contains C, R, or N.
 Also, the word must contain A and E.

 Since A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, we need to try a word that places A and E in different positions.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, N.
 - Contains A and E.
 - Places A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants that we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters, and also includes A and E in new positions.

 Let's try to put A in a different position, say position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we know E is not at position 5, so E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must avoid the positions that we know are wrong for A and E.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's try the word ""SLATE"", but note:
 - S: we don't know about S.
 - L: we don't know about L.
 - A: we know A is in the word, but in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3. However, our feedback said A is not at position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice because it puts A at position 3.

 We need a word that has A and E, and avoids C, R, N, and places A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Let's try ""STALE"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We need to put A in a position that is not 3. Let's try position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" but that has D, I, U and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AISLE"":
 - A at position 1 (which is new)
 - I at position 2
 - S at position 3
 - L at position 4
 - E at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try ""AEGIS"": 
 - A at position 1
 - E at position 2
 - G at position 3
 - I at position 4
 - S at position 5

 But note: we don't know if G, I, S are in the word. Also, we are testing new letters.

 However, we must avoid the known incorrect positions: 
   For A: we know it's not at 3 -> we are putting it at 1, which is okay.
   For E: we know it's not at 5 -> we are putting it at 2, which is okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at 3, and E is in the word but not at 5. So ""AEGIS"" is a valid try? 

 However, we are not sure if the word has G, I, S. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters and avoids the known absent letters.

 Another idea: ""SAUTE""
 - S at 1
 - A at 2 (new position for A)
 - U at 3
 - T at 4
 - E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at 5.

 Let's try ""STEAL"":
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - E at 3
 - A at 4
 - L at 5

 This way:
   A is at position 4 (not 3) -> okay
   E is at position 3 (not 5) -> okay

 And we test S, T, L.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, L. This is a good way to test them.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STEAL"" is a valid English word.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at position 4, which is different. So that's good.

 Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that's good.

 Let's go with ""STEAL"".

 However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

 But let me check: we are using S, T, E, A, L. We know A and E are in the word, and S, T, L are new.

 This is a good way to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES""
 - T at 1
 - A at 2
 - L at 3
 - E at 4
 - S at 5

 This puts A at 2 (not 3) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's acceptable.

 But note: we are trying to maximize information. ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has A and E, and we are testing three new letters (S, T, L) in ""STEAL"" and two new letters (T, L, S) in ""TALES"". Actually, both test 3 new letters.

 But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can choose either. Let's go with ""STEAL"" because it uses common letters.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

<guess>steal</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the word).
- **A** cannot be in position 3, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** at position 4 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 3 (not 5).
- Tests **S, T, L** (new letters).
- Excludes **C, R, N**.

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)  [since it was at position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- L: x (not in the word)

So, what we know so far:
- The secret word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 1: A is not at position 3, E is not at position 5.
  - From guess 2: E is not at position 3, A is not at position 4.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word).
- Does not include C, R, N, S, T, L.
- Places A and E in positions that are still possible (i.e., not the ones we've tried and failed).

Possible positions for A: It cannot be at 3 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: It cannot be at 5 (from guess1) or 3 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we cannot put A and E in the same position? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters have we not tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L.

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We have two known letters: A and E.

We need to choose a word that has A and E, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

We also need to place A and E in positions that are still allowed.

Let's list the allowed positions for A: 1, 2, 5
For E: 1, 2, 4

But note: we cannot have both A and E at the same position? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We also want to test common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize information.

Let's try to form a word that has A and E, and three new letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1 and E at position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. We haven't tried that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So we can try:

Word: A _ _ _ _ 
But we also need E somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be: A _ _ E _

But we need to fill the middle.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the absent letters.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""ABIDE"": A at 1, B at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden (from guess1). So not allowed.
- ""AGREE"": has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that's 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not allowed.

We need to avoid E at 5 and R at all.

Another word: ""ADOBE"": A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""ALIKE"": but L is absent (from guess2) and I at 3? But L is out.

""AMUSE"": A at 1, M at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> S is absent (from guess2) and E at 5 is forbidden.

We must avoid S, T, L, C, R, N.

Let me try to think of words with A and E, without the absent letters.

Possible: ""ABIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""ABOVE"": A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""AWAKE"": A at 1, W at 2, A at 3 (duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate A is allowed) -> but we have A at 1 and 3. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are not sure. But we can try? But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. W is new. But what about the second A? We don't know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has both A and E.

Another idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed? But we have E at 4. And A at 2. But L is absent.

We need to avoid T, L, S, etc.

Let me try ""OAKEN"": but O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> but N is absent (from guess1) and we have E at 4 (allowed) and A at 2 (allowed). But N is absent.

Another: ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be at 4. And A at 2 is allowed. And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's possible.

But note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.

Similarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.

""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.

""MAKER"" is out.

""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed. Letters: P, A, V, E, D. All new and not absent.

But is ""PAVED"" a word? Yes, meaning to have been in office or position for a long time.

Another option: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent. Not allowed.

""WAIVED"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""WAIVE"": only 5 letters? W-A-I-V-E -> that's 5: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is forbidden.

""PAVED"" seems okay: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try to put A at 5? Because we haven't tried that.

For example: ""PIECE"": P at 1, I at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is allowed? Yes, but we already know E is not at position 3 from guess2? Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.

So for E: we know it's not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.

Similarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.

Now, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.

For example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.

""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or E.

We need both A and E.

Another: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1). So no.

""PLACE"": P at 1, L at 2 -> L is absent.

""TRACE"": T and C are absent.

""BLADE"": B at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""SHADE"": S and L absent.

""PHASE"": S and L absent.

""GRAPE"": G at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.

""PLACE"" is out.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""RAISE"": R and S absent.

""VALET"": V at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""PAVED"" seems good: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.

So we cannot put A at 4.

If we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.

For example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.

""JAZZY"" -> no E.

""AROMA"" -> no E.

We need E.

""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> 
- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)
- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)
- Letters: M, E, D, I, A. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's valid.

""MEDIA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BEIGE"": B at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden and also duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed. But we can try? However, E at 5 is forbidden.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent.

""VEIL"": only 4 letters.

""DEVIL"": D at 1, E at 2, V at 3, I at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent and E at 5? Also, L is absent.

""HEAVE"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""MEANY"": M at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""BEADY"" is invalid.

""OAKEN"": N absent.

""BAKED"": E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but we have E at 4 and D at 5. And A at 2. So: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is ""BAKED"". But we have E at 4? Yes. And A at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 2 and it's not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 4 is new.

But note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.

And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate.

But we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

We need to choose one that tests more common letters.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.

""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.

""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.

Common letters: D, M, P, B, etc.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven't tried A at 2 or E at 4.

Alternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.

""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.

""EMBARK"": too long.

""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.

""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H's? But we don't know about duplicates.

But we are avoiding N, etc.

""OPAQUE"": too long.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don't know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word. But it's acceptable.

But we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.

So ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.

""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.

But ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.

We can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.

Another word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.

""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REAVE"": R absent.

""SEAVE"": S absent.

""TAPE"": too short.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.

But note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.

In ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.

We also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.

We know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.

Similarly for ""MEDIA"".

But we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.

What about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. 
- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)
- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)
- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.

And distinct letters.

""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.

But ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). 

But we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.

So ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":

- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.
- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.
- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.
- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.

We want to test the position for A and E that we haven't tried. We haven't tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.

In ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That's two new positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

In ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.

In ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.

""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.

""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? 

But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.

""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.

""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REACT"": R and T absent.

""SEIZE"": S absent.

""TEASE"": T and S absent.

So ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.

Also, it tests I and U, which are vowels.

But we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don't know if there are more vowels.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.

Another word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.

""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.

""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""RADIO"": R absent.

""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.

""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.

""WAIFT"": not common.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.

But let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.

We can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.

""ABYSS"": no E.

I think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are putting A at 1. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.

Similarly, E at 4.

So let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""

But let me double-check the positions:
- A at 1: not tried before -> possible
- D at 2: new
- I at 3: new
- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)
- U at 5: new

This will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.

If A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it's not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.

We also test I and U.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.

But ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.

I think either is fine. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

<guess>adieu</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).
  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.
- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven't been ruled out.

**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).
- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>adieu</guess>",adieu,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)  [since it was at position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- L: x (not in the word)

So, what we know so far:
- The secret word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 1: A is not at position 3, E is not at position 5.
  - From guess 2: E is not at position 3, A is not at position 4.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word).
- Does not include C, R, N, S, T, L.
- Places A and E in positions that are still possible (i.e., not the ones we've tried and failed).

Possible positions for A: It cannot be at 3 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: It cannot be at 5 (from guess1) or 3 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we cannot put A and E in the same position? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters have we not tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L.

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We have two known letters: A and E.

We need to choose a word that has A and E, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

We also need to place A and E in positions that are still allowed.

Let's list the allowed positions for A: 1, 2, 5
For E: 1, 2, 4

But note: we cannot have both A and E at the same position? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We also want to test common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize information.

Let's try to form a word that has A and E, and three new letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1 and E at position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. We haven't tried that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So we can try:

Word: A _ _ _ _ 
But we also need E somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be: A _ _ E _

But we need to fill the middle.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the absent letters.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""ABIDE"": A at 1, B at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden (from guess1). So not allowed.
- ""AGREE"": has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that's 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not allowed.

We need to avoid E at 5 and R at all.

Another word: ""ADOBE"": A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""ALIKE"": but L is absent (from guess2) and I at 3? But L is out.

""AMUSE"": A at 1, M at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> S is absent (from guess2) and E at 5 is forbidden.

We must avoid S, T, L, C, R, N.

Let me try to think of words with A and E, without the absent letters.

Possible: ""ABIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""ABOVE"": A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""AWAKE"": A at 1, W at 2, A at 3 (duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate A is allowed) -> but we have A at 1 and 3. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are not sure. But we can try? But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. W is new. But what about the second A? We don't know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has both A and E.

Another idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed? But we have E at 4. And A at 2. But L is absent.

We need to avoid T, L, S, etc.

Let me try ""OAKEN"": but O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> but N is absent (from guess1) and we have E at 4 (allowed) and A at 2 (allowed). But N is absent.

Another: ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be at 4. And A at 2 is allowed. And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's possible.

But note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.

Similarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.

""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.

""MAKER"" is out.

""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed. Letters: P, A, V, E, D. All new and not absent.

But is ""PAVED"" a word? Yes, meaning to have been in office or position for a long time.

Another option: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent. Not allowed.

""WAIVED"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""WAIVE"": only 5 letters? W-A-I-V-E -> that's 5: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is forbidden.

""PAVED"" seems okay: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try to put A at 5? Because we haven't tried that.

For example: ""PIECE"": P at 1, I at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is allowed? Yes, but we already know E is not at position 3 from guess2? Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.

So for E: we know it's not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.

Similarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.

Now, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.

For example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.

""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or E.

We need both A and E.

Another: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1). So no.

""PLACE"": P at 1, L at 2 -> L is absent.

""TRACE"": T and C are absent.

""BLADE"": B at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""SHADE"": S and L absent.

""PHASE"": S and L absent.

""GRAPE"": G at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.

""PLACE"" is out.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""RAISE"": R and S absent.

""VALET"": V at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""PAVED"" seems good: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.

So we cannot put A at 4.

If we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.

For example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.

""JAZZY"" -> no E.

""AROMA"" -> no E.

We need E.

""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> 
- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)
- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)
- Letters: M, E, D, I, A. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's valid.

""MEDIA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BEIGE"": B at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden and also duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed. But we can try? However, E at 5 is forbidden.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent.

""VEIL"": only 4 letters.

""DEVIL"": D at 1, E at 2, V at 3, I at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent and E at 5? Also, L is absent.

""HEAVE"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""MEANY"": M at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""BEADY"" is invalid.

""OAKEN"": N absent.

""BAKED"": E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but we have E at 4 and D at 5. And A at 2. So: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is ""BAKED"". But we have E at 4? Yes. And A at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 2 and it's not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 4 is new.

But note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.

And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate.

But we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

We need to choose one that tests more common letters.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.

""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.

""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.

Common letters: D, M, P, B, etc.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven't tried A at 2 or E at 4.

Alternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.

""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.

""EMBARK"": too long.

""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.

""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H's? But we don't know about duplicates.

But we are avoiding N, etc.

""OPAQUE"": too long.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don't know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word. But it's acceptable.

But we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.

So ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.

""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.

But ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.

We can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.

Another word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.

""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REAVE"": R absent.

""SEAVE"": S absent.

""TAPE"": too short.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.

But note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.

In ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.

We also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.

We know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.

Similarly for ""MEDIA"".

But we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.

What about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. 
- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)
- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)
- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.

And distinct letters.

""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.

But ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). 

But we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.

So ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":

- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.
- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.
- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.
- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.

We want to test the position for A and E that we haven't tried. We haven't tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.

In ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That's two new positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

In ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.

In ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.

""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.

""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? 

But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.

""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.

""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REACT"": R and T absent.

""SEIZE"": S absent.

""TEASE"": T and S absent.

So ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.

Also, it tests I and U, which are vowels.

But we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don't know if there are more vowels.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.

Another word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.

""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.

""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""RADIO"": R absent.

""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.

""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.

""WAIFT"": not common.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.

But let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.

We can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.

""ABYSS"": no E.

I think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are putting A at 1. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.

Similarly, E at 4.

So let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""

But let me double-check the positions:
- A at 1: not tried before -> possible
- D at 2: new
- I at 3: new
- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)
- U at 5: new

This will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.

If A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it's not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.

We also test I and U.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.

But ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.

I think either is fine. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

<guess>adieu</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).
  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.
- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven't been ruled out.

**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).
- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: adieu -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) I(x) E(✓) U(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We can eliminate any word that contains C, R, or N.
 Also, the word must contain A and E.

 Since A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, we need to try a word that places A and E in different positions.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, N.
 - Contains A and E.
 - Places A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants that we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters, and also includes A and E in new positions.

 Let's try to put A in a different position, say position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we know E is not at position 5, so E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must avoid the positions that we know are wrong for A and E.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's try the word ""SLATE"", but note:
 - S: we don't know about S.
 - L: we don't know about L.
 - A: we know A is in the word, but in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3. However, our feedback said A is not at position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice because it puts A at position 3.

 We need a word that has A and E, and avoids C, R, N, and places A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Let's try ""STALE"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We need to put A in a position that is not 3. Let's try position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" but that has D, I, U and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AISLE"":
 - A at position 1 (which is new)
 - I at position 2
 - S at position 3
 - L at position 4
 - E at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try ""AEGIS"": 
 - A at position 1
 - E at position 2
 - G at position 3
 - I at position 4
 - S at position 5

 But note: we don't know if G, I, S are in the word. Also, we are testing new letters.

 However, we must avoid the known incorrect positions: 
   For A: we know it's not at 3 -> we are putting it at 1, which is okay.
   For E: we know it's not at 5 -> we are putting it at 2, which is okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at 3, and E is in the word but not at 5. So ""AEGIS"" is a valid try? 

 However, we are not sure if the word has G, I, S. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters and avoids the known absent letters.

 Another idea: ""SAUTE""
 - S at 1
 - A at 2 (new position for A)
 - U at 3
 - T at 4
 - E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at 5.

 Let's try ""STEAL"":
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - E at 3
 - A at 4
 - L at 5

 This way:
   A is at position 4 (not 3) -> okay
   E is at position 3 (not 5) -> okay

 And we test S, T, L.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, L. This is a good way to test them.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STEAL"" is a valid English word.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at position 4, which is different. So that's good.

 Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that's good.

 Let's go with ""STEAL"".

 However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

 But let me check: we are using S, T, E, A, L. We know A and E are in the word, and S, T, L are new.

 This is a good way to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES""
 - T at 1
 - A at 2
 - L at 3
 - E at 4
 - S at 5

 This puts A at 2 (not 3) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's acceptable.

 But note: we are trying to maximize information. ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has A and E, and we are testing three new letters (S, T, L) in ""STEAL"" and two new letters (T, L, S) in ""TALES"". Actually, both test 3 new letters.

 But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can choose either. Let's go with ""STEAL"" because it uses common letters.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

<guess>steal</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the word).
- **A** cannot be in position 3, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** at position 4 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 3 (not 5).
- Tests **S, T, L** (new letters).
- Excludes **C, R, N**.

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>steal</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)  [since it was at position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- L: x (not in the word)

So, what we know so far:
- The secret word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 1: A is not at position 3, E is not at position 5.
  - From guess 2: E is not at position 3, A is not at position 4.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word).
- Does not include C, R, N, S, T, L.
- Places A and E in positions that are still possible (i.e., not the ones we've tried and failed).

Possible positions for A: It cannot be at 3 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: It cannot be at 5 (from guess1) or 3 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we cannot put A and E in the same position? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters have we not tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L.

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We have two known letters: A and E.

We need to choose a word that has A and E, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

We also need to place A and E in positions that are still allowed.

Let's list the allowed positions for A: 1, 2, 5
For E: 1, 2, 4

But note: we cannot have both A and E at the same position? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We also want to test common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize information.

Let's try to form a word that has A and E, and three new letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1 and E at position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. We haven't tried that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So we can try:

Word: A _ _ _ _ 
But we also need E somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be: A _ _ E _

But we need to fill the middle.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the absent letters.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""ABIDE"": A at 1, B at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden (from guess1). So not allowed.
- ""AGREE"": has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that's 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not allowed.

We need to avoid E at 5 and R at all.

Another word: ""ADOBE"": A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""ALIKE"": but L is absent (from guess2) and I at 3? But L is out.

""AMUSE"": A at 1, M at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> S is absent (from guess2) and E at 5 is forbidden.

We must avoid S, T, L, C, R, N.

Let me try to think of words with A and E, without the absent letters.

Possible: ""ABIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""ABOVE"": A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""AWAKE"": A at 1, W at 2, A at 3 (duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate A is allowed) -> but we have A at 1 and 3. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are not sure. But we can try? But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. W is new. But what about the second A? We don't know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has both A and E.

Another idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed? But we have E at 4. And A at 2. But L is absent.

We need to avoid T, L, S, etc.

Let me try ""OAKEN"": but O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> but N is absent (from guess1) and we have E at 4 (allowed) and A at 2 (allowed). But N is absent.

Another: ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be at 4. And A at 2 is allowed. And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's possible.

But note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.

Similarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.

""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.

""MAKER"" is out.

""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed. Letters: P, A, V, E, D. All new and not absent.

But is ""PAVED"" a word? Yes, meaning to have been in office or position for a long time.

Another option: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent. Not allowed.

""WAIVED"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""WAIVE"": only 5 letters? W-A-I-V-E -> that's 5: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is forbidden.

""PAVED"" seems okay: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try to put A at 5? Because we haven't tried that.

For example: ""PIECE"": P at 1, I at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is allowed? Yes, but we already know E is not at position 3 from guess2? Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.

So for E: we know it's not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.

Similarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.

Now, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.

For example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.

""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or E.

We need both A and E.

Another: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1). So no.

""PLACE"": P at 1, L at 2 -> L is absent.

""TRACE"": T and C are absent.

""BLADE"": B at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""SHADE"": S and L absent.

""PHASE"": S and L absent.

""GRAPE"": G at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.

""PLACE"" is out.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""RAISE"": R and S absent.

""VALET"": V at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""PAVED"" seems good: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.

So we cannot put A at 4.

If we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.

For example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.

""JAZZY"" -> no E.

""AROMA"" -> no E.

We need E.

""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> 
- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)
- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)
- Letters: M, E, D, I, A. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's valid.

""MEDIA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BEIGE"": B at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden and also duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed. But we can try? However, E at 5 is forbidden.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent.

""VEIL"": only 4 letters.

""DEVIL"": D at 1, E at 2, V at 3, I at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent and E at 5? Also, L is absent.

""HEAVE"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""MEANY"": M at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""BEADY"" is invalid.

""OAKEN"": N absent.

""BAKED"": E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but we have E at 4 and D at 5. And A at 2. So: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is ""BAKED"". But we have E at 4? Yes. And A at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 2 and it's not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 4 is new.

But note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.

And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate.

But we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

We need to choose one that tests more common letters.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.

""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.

""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.

Common letters: D, M, P, B, etc.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven't tried A at 2 or E at 4.

Alternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.

""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.

""EMBARK"": too long.

""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.

""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H's? But we don't know about duplicates.

But we are avoiding N, etc.

""OPAQUE"": too long.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don't know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word. But it's acceptable.

But we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.

So ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.

""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.

But ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.

We can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.

Another word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.

""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REAVE"": R absent.

""SEAVE"": S absent.

""TAPE"": too short.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.

But note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.

In ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.

We also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.

We know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.

Similarly for ""MEDIA"".

But we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.

What about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. 
- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)
- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)
- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.

And distinct letters.

""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.

But ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). 

But we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.

So ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":

- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.
- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.
- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.
- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.

We want to test the position for A and E that we haven't tried. We haven't tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.

In ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That's two new positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

In ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.

In ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.

""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.

""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? 

But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.

""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.

""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REACT"": R and T absent.

""SEIZE"": S absent.

""TEASE"": T and S absent.

So ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.

Also, it tests I and U, which are vowels.

But we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don't know if there are more vowels.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.

Another word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.

""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.

""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""RADIO"": R absent.

""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.

""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.

""WAIFT"": not common.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.

But let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.

We can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.

""ABYSS"": no E.

I think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are putting A at 1. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.

Similarly, E at 4.

So let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""

But let me double-check the positions:
- A at 1: not tried before -> possible
- D at 2: new
- I at 3: new
- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)
- U at 5: new

This will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.

If A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it's not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.

We also test I and U.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.

But ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.

I think either is fine. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

<guess>adieu</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).
  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.
- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven't been ruled out.

**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).
- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.

So that\'s good.\n\n Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that\'s good.\n\n Let\'s go with ""STEAL"".\n\n However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them.

So that\'s out.\n\n Another option: ""TALES""\n - T at 1\n - A at 2\n - L at 3\n - E at 4\n - S at 5\n\n This puts A at 2 (not 3) and E at 4 (not 5). So that\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we are trying to maximize information. ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are both good.\n\n However, we have to consider that the secret word has A and E, and we are testing three new letters (S, T, L) in ""STEAL"" and two new letters (T, L, S) in ""TALES"".

However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That\'s 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that\'s 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden.

We don\'t know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe need a word that has both A and E.\n\nAnother idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).\n\n""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed?

None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that\'s possible.\n\nBut note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.\n\n""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.\n\n""MAKER"" is out.\n\n""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed.

Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.\n\nSo for E: we know it\'s not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.\n\nSimilarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.\n\nNow, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.\n\nFor example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.\n\n""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.\n\n""JUMBO"": no A or E.\n\nWe need both A and E.\n\nAnother: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1).

For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.\n\n""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.\n\nSo we cannot put A at 4.\n\nIf we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.\n\nFor example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.\n\n""JAZZY"" -> no E.\n\n""AROMA"" -> no E.\n\nWe need E.\n\n""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> \n- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)\n- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)\n- Letters: M, E, D, I, A.

Yes, because we haven\'t tried A at 2 and it\'s not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4 is new.\n\nBut note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.\n\nAnd the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nWe have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.\n\n""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.\n\n""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.\n\nCommon letters: D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nI think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven\'t tried A at 2 or E at 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.\n\n""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.\n\n""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.\n\n""EMBARK"": too long.\n\n""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.\n\n""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nBut we are avoiding N, etc.\n\n""OPAQUE"": too long.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don\'t know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D\'s? And we don\'t know if D is in the word. But it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.\n\n""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.\n\nBut ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.\n\n""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""LEAVE"": L absent.\n\n""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""REAVE"": R absent.\n\n""SEAVE"": S absent.\n\n""TAPE"": too short.\n\n""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.\n\nBut note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.\n\nIn ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.\n\nWe know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.\n\nIn ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.\n\nSimilarly for ""MEDIA"".\n\nBut we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.\n\nWhat about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. \n- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)\n- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)\n- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.\n\nAnd distinct letters.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). \n\nBut we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":\n\n- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.\n- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.\n- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.\n- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.\n\nWe want to test the position for A and E that we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.\n\nIn ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That\'s two new positions.\n\nIn ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nIn ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.\n\nIn ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nWe also want to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.\n\n""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.\n\n""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? \n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.\n\n""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.\n\n""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""REACT"": R and T absent.\n\n""SEIZE"": S absent.\n\n""TEASE"": T and S absent.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, it tests I and U, which are vowels.\n\nBut we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don\'t know if there are more vowels.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.\n\n""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.\n\n""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.\n\n""RADIO"": R absent.\n\n""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.\n\n""WAIFT"": not common.\n\n""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.\n\nWe can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.\n\n""ABYSS"": no E.\n\nI think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we are putting A at 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ADIEU"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""\n\nBut let me double-check the positions:\n- A at 1: not tried before -> possible\n- D at 2: new\n- I at 3: new\n- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)\n- U at 5: new\n\nThis will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.\n\nIf A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it\'s not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.\n\nWe also test I and U.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.\n\nI think either is fine. Let\'s go with ""ADIEU"".\n\n<guess>adieu</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).\n- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).\n  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.\n  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.\n  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **E**.\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:\n- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).\n- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>adieu</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: adieu -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 3)
- A: - (present, but not at position 4)
- L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""adieu""
- A: - (present, but not at position 1)
- D: - (present, but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
- U: x (absent)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct position**: 
   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).

2. **Present letters** (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from guess 1), not at position 4 (from guess 2), and not at position 1 (from guess 3). So A cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
   - D: present, but not at position 2 (from guess 3). So D is in the word, but not at position 2.

3. **Absent letters**: 
   - From all guesses: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.

4. **Letters we know are in the word**:
   - A (must be at 2 or 5)
   - E (at position 4)
   - D (present, not at 2)

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 3 known: A, E, D, but one of them might be duplicated? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet).

The word structure so far: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 1, and not the absent letters)
Position 2: could be A? or D? or another letter
Position 3: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 3, and not absent letters)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: could be A? (since A can be at 5) or another letter.

We know A is at 2 or 5. But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has E at position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Includes A and D (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.
- Tries to test A at position 2 or 5 and D at a position that is not 2.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available positions for A: 2 or 5.
Available positions for D: 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because D cannot be at 2).

We can try to put A at position 2 and D at position 1 or 3 or 5? But we have to fill the other positions with new letters.

Alternatively, we can put A at position 5 and D at position 1, 3, or 2? But D cannot be at 2, so only 1 or 3.

Let's think of words that have E at 4, and include A and D, without the absent letters.

We also need to consider that we have two unknown letters (if A is at 2, then we have positions 1, 3, and 5 to fill; if A is at 5, then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill, and D must be in one of 1,3,5 but not 2).

Case 1: A at position 2.
Then the word: _ A _ E _
We need to place D in one of positions 1, 3, or 5, and the remaining two positions must be filled with new letters (not absent and not A,E,D).

Case 2: A at position 5.
Then the word: _ _ _ E A
D must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 2, and 5 is taken by A).

We can try to test one of these cases.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, for case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Word pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to put D in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.

But note: if we put D at 1, then the word: D A _ E _
If we put D at 3: _ A D E _
If we put D at 5: _ A _ E D

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Available letters: we have not tried: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Let's try to find valid words.

- For pattern _ A D E _: 
  - The third letter must be D and fourth E? So _ A D E _
  - Examples: ""BADED"" -> but B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""BADED"" is not a common word? Actually, ""baded"" is not standard. Maybe ""bade"" is the past tense, but we need 5 letters. ""BADED"" is not a word.

  - ""MADED"": M at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""madded"" is not a common word. The past tense is ""maded""? Not really. Actually, ""maded"" is not valid.

  - ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""padded"" is a word. But duplicate D? We don't know if D is duplicated. But we can try? However, we are testing D at 3, but if D is duplicated, we might get confusing feedback.

  - ""WADDY"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, D at 4? But E must be at 4, so not. We have E at 4.

  - This pattern is hard. Let me think: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2). So invalid.

  - ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent, and C is out.

  - ""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> T absent and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

  - This pattern seems difficult. Maybe put D at 1.

Pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a common word. ""Damed"" might be a variant, but let's avoid.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.
- ""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4 -> I absent, and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

We need E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Possible: ""DADDY"" -> no E at 4.

""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.

""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.

""DANDY"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""DAILY"" and ""DANCE"" are out.

What about ""DAMED""? D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D. But we don't know if D is duplicated. If we use this, and if the word has only one D, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better option.

But ""damed"" is not a standard word. Let me think of common words.

""DAVIT"": but I at 4? We need E at 4.

""DAWED"": D at 1, A at 2, W at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""dawed"" is not common.

""DAZED"": D at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

This pattern is difficult without using absent letters.

Now, case 2: A at 5, E at 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ E A

D must be at position 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DWEPT"": not a word.
- ""DUPED"": D at 1, U at 2 -> U absent.
- ""DWEEB"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""ABREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA D"": no, duplicate? ""AREDE"" -> R absent.
- ""DODEA"": not a word.
- ""HOMED"": H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5? This has D at 5. We need A at 5.

We need the last letter to be A.

So: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""AREA"" is 4 letters.
- ""OAKED"": O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5, not at 2. This has A at 2.

We need the word to end with ""EA"", but with E at 4 and A at 5: so the last two letters are ""EA"".

So pattern: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""BREAD"": B at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""CREAM"": C absent.
- ""DREAD"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""FREED"": F at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""WRECK"": no A.

We need the third letter to be D and the fourth E, and fifth A.

So: letter1, letter2, D, E, A.

Examples:
- ""PINED"": but no A? We need A at 5.

We need the word to end with ""DEA"".

Common words: ""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3? But we need E at 4 and A at 5. Here E is at 3 and A at 5? No, pattern is _ _ D E A, so E at 4 and A at 5.

So: ""??DEA""

Examples:
- ""ABREA"" -> not a word.
- ""AREA"" -> too short.
- ""AUDEA"": not a word.

Actually, ""DEA"" at the end: ""DEA"" is not common. We need a 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"".

There are not many English words ending with ""DEA"". The most common is ""opera"" but that's O-P-E-R-A, which is O(1),P(2),E(3),R(4),A(5). But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 3 and R at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A.

So the word must end with ""EA"", but that would be positions 4 and 5: E at 4, A at 5. But in ""opera"", E is at 3 and A at 5? No: positions:
Position 1: O
Position 2: P
Position 3: E
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

So it's O-P-E-R-A, which is not _ _ D E A.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A. So the last two letters must be ""EA"", but that would be: position 4 = E, position 5 = A. So the word ends with ""EA"".

But in the pattern _ _ D E A, the fourth letter is E and fifth is A, so the last two are E and then A? No: the pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: D, 4: E, 5: A.

So the word ends with ""DEA"", not ""EA"". ""DEA"" means decommission, but it's 3 letters? 5-letter words ending with ""DEA"" are rare.

Common words: ""opera"" ends with ""A"", not ""DEA"".

Actually, I can't think of any common 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"". The only one I can think of is ""opera"", but that has E at position 3, not 4.

We need E at position 4 and A at position 5: so the word must be ...E A, meaning position 4 is E and position 5 is A.

But ""DEA"" is not a common ending. For example, ""MEDIA"" is M-E-D-I-A, which is positions: M(1), E(2), D(3), I(4), A(5). So E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5. But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 2 and D at 3.

We need E at 4 and A at 5: so the word must have the fourth letter E and fifth A.

But ""DEA"" is not a standard ending. Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern for A at 5 and E at 4: the word should be ? ? ? E A.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is P-I-Z-Z-A, no E.

""JUMBA"" no E.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that A might be at 2.

Back to case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to place D in 1,3, or 5.

But if we put D at 1: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5, and avoid absent letters.

Position 3: must be a letter, and position 5: must be a letter.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a standard word. ""Damned"" is 6 letters.
- ""DADDY"": no E at 4.
- ""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.
- ""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.
- ""DAPER"": D at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R absent.

It's hard to find words without the absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"": but we have B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5? But we have D at 5. And ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D. So positions: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters? B, K, D are not absent? We haven't tried B or K. So it's possible.

But in this word, we are putting A at 2 (which is allowed) and D at 5. We also test B and K.

But we have E at 4, which is fixed.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).

But we have to check if D can be at 5. Yes, because we haven't tried D at 5.

Similarly, we can try ""MAKED"": not a word.

""PAVED"": P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Also a candidate.

""HAVED"": H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""WADED"": W(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5) -> duplicate D, and D at 3 and 5? But we are putting D at 3 and 5? But we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""waDED"" has two D's.

But we can try, but it might be messy.

""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" are better.

But we also have the option to put D at position 3.

For example, pattern: _ A D E _

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Examples:
- ""BADGE"": B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, G at 4? But we need E at 4, not G. So no.
- ""BADE"": too short.
- ""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""haded"" is not common.
- ""MADED"": not a word.
- ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

It seems difficult to find a word with E at 4 and D at 3 without using absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" we have.

But we also have the possibility of A at 5.

If A at 5, then pattern: _ _ _ E A

And D must be at 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DUEA"": not 5 letters.
- ""DECEA"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""OPREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA"": too short.
- ""UREDA"": U at 1, R at 2 -> U and R absent.
- ""ENDEA"": not a word.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, and A is at 2 or 5.

We can try a word that tests A at 2 and also tests other possibilities.

But we have to include D.

Let me list possible words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- Position 4: E
- A must be at 2 or 5.
- D is present, not at 2, so at 1,3,5.

But if A is at 5, then D cannot be at 5 (same position), so D must be at 1 or 3.

If A is at 2, then D can be at 1,3,5.

But we need to find a word that exists.

Perhaps ""BAKED"" is a good choice: it tests A at 2 and D at 5, and we test B and K.

Similarly, ""PAVED"" tests P and V.

But we also have the option to test A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2? But we need E at 4, not at 2. In ""MEDIA"", E is at 2, not 4.

We need E at 4.

So for A at 5 and E at 4: we need a word ending with ""EA"", but as we saw, there are few.

""DEA"" is not common. The only one I know is ""opera"", but that doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think we have to consider that A might be at 2.

So let's go with ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests:
- A at 2: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then A must be at 5.
- D at 5: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.
- We test B and K.

If we get feedback that A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and D must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, if D is not at 5, then D is at 1 or 3.

But we also test B and K.

Another candidate: ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are known to be present, and B, K are new).

Similarly, ""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D.

Both are valid words.

We can also consider ""HATED"": but T is absent.

""MADED"": not a word.

""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D. So positions: W(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters.

So ""WAVED"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BAKED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".

Now, which one to choose?

We want to test new letters. We have not tried: B, K, P, V, W, M, etc.

""BAKED"" tests B and K.
""PAVED"" tests P and V.
""WAVED"" tests W and V.

We can choose ""WAVED"" because W is a common letter? Or ""BAKED"" because K is common.

But we also have to consider that if A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and we can adjust.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have two known letters (A and D) to place, and we need to find the other two.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A at 5 and D at 1 or 3, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""DOZEN"": but N absent and E at 4? ""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N, so E at 4? Actually: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent and A is missing.

We need A at 5.

""DEBAR"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, A at 4? But A cannot be at 4 (from guess2). And E at 2? We need E at 4.

Not matching.

""DOULA"": no E at 4.

I think we have to go with one of the ""BAKED"" type words.

But let me check if there is a word with A at 5 and E at 4.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is not ending with EA.

""JUMBA"" no E.

""KARMA"": K at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3 -> L absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

Perhaps ""DEUCE"": but C absent and E at 2.

I think we have to accept that A is at 2 for now, and test that.

So let's choose ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting A at 2 and D at 5.

If A is at 2, then we get a hit for A. If not, then A must be at 5.

Similarly, for D: we are putting D at 5. If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B and K.

So ""BAKED"" is a good test.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""BAKED"" seems fine.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BAKED"" is valid.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"" has E at 2, not 4.

""OCEAN"": O at 1, C at 2 -> C absent.

""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3 -> E at 3 is not 4.

I think we have to stick with A at 2.

So guess: ""BAKED""

But in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4, which is correct, and A at 2, D at 5.

We also test B and K.

If the feedback shows:
- If A is at 2, we get a hit. If not, we know A is at 5.
- If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

And we test B and K.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another common word: ""BALED"" but L absent.

""BAKED"" is okay.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. In ""BAKED"", we have B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are present, B, K not tried).

So let's go with ""BAKED"".

But wait, in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a new position.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D.

But ""BAKED"" is fine.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5 without using absent letters.

For example, ""DEWAR"": not a word.

""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4 -> U absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N absent and I absent.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, our fourth guess: ""BAKED""

But let's confirm the feedback we expect if A is at 2 and D at 5, but we don't know if that's the case.

We are testing the hypothesis.

If the word is ""BAKED"", we might get lucky.

But if not, we get information.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar but with P and V instead of B and K.

But B and K are as common as P and V? Actually, K is more common than V.

But both are valid.

I think ""BAKED"" is better.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""BAKED"" is standard.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try to test A at 5.

But I can't find a common word with E at 4 and A at 5.

So let's stick with ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a position we are testing.

If D is at 5, we get a hit. If not, we know D is at 1 or 3.

Similarly, for A: we are putting at 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So it's good.

We can also consider ""DAVIT"", but I at 3? And we need E at 4, not I.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there is a word like ""DEWAR"" but it's not English.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""BAKED"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have E at 4 correct? Actually, in ""adieu"", E was at 4 and we got a check, so E is at 4.

So in ""BAKED"", E at 4 is correct, so we expect that.

A at 2: we are testing if it's correct.

D at 5: testing if it's correct.

B and K: new letters.

So let's do it.

<guess>baked</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 3: E(✓)).
- **A is present** but cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4 (from Guesses 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
- **D is present** but not at position 2 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with A and D needing to be placed).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **D**.
- **E must be at position 4**.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, K) to gather more information.
- Prioritize resolving the positions of A and D.

**""BAKED""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 2 (testing if A is at position 2).
- Places **D** at position 5 (testing if D is at position 5).
- Keeps **E** at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- Tests new letters **B** and **K** (common consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and D while testing two new letters.

<guess>baked</guess>",baked,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 3)
- A: - (present, but not at position 4)
- L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""adieu""
- A: - (present, but not at position 1)
- D: - (present, but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
- U: x (absent)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct position**: 
   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).

2. **Present letters** (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from guess 1), not at position 4 (from guess 2), and not at position 1 (from guess 3). So A cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
   - D: present, but not at position 2 (from guess 3). So D is in the word, but not at position 2.

3. **Absent letters**: 
   - From all guesses: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.

4. **Letters we know are in the word**:
   - A (must be at 2 or 5)
   - E (at position 4)
   - D (present, not at 2)

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 3 known: A, E, D, but one of them might be duplicated? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet).

The word structure so far: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 1, and not the absent letters)
Position 2: could be A? or D? or another letter
Position 3: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 3, and not absent letters)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: could be A? (since A can be at 5) or another letter.

We know A is at 2 or 5. But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has E at position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Includes A and D (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.
- Tries to test A at position 2 or 5 and D at a position that is not 2.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available positions for A: 2 or 5.
Available positions for D: 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because D cannot be at 2).

We can try to put A at position 2 and D at position 1 or 3 or 5? But we have to fill the other positions with new letters.

Alternatively, we can put A at position 5 and D at position 1, 3, or 2? But D cannot be at 2, so only 1 or 3.

Let's think of words that have E at 4, and include A and D, without the absent letters.

We also need to consider that we have two unknown letters (if A is at 2, then we have positions 1, 3, and 5 to fill; if A is at 5, then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill, and D must be in one of 1,3,5 but not 2).

Case 1: A at position 2.
Then the word: _ A _ E _
We need to place D in one of positions 1, 3, or 5, and the remaining two positions must be filled with new letters (not absent and not A,E,D).

Case 2: A at position 5.
Then the word: _ _ _ E A
D must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 2, and 5 is taken by A).

We can try to test one of these cases.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, for case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Word pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to put D in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.

But note: if we put D at 1, then the word: D A _ E _
If we put D at 3: _ A D E _
If we put D at 5: _ A _ E D

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Available letters: we have not tried: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Let's try to find valid words.

- For pattern _ A D E _: 
  - The third letter must be D and fourth E? So _ A D E _
  - Examples: ""BADED"" -> but B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""BADED"" is not a common word? Actually, ""baded"" is not standard. Maybe ""bade"" is the past tense, but we need 5 letters. ""BADED"" is not a word.

  - ""MADED"": M at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""madded"" is not a common word. The past tense is ""maded""? Not really. Actually, ""maded"" is not valid.

  - ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""padded"" is a word. But duplicate D? We don't know if D is duplicated. But we can try? However, we are testing D at 3, but if D is duplicated, we might get confusing feedback.

  - ""WADDY"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, D at 4? But E must be at 4, so not. We have E at 4.

  - This pattern is hard. Let me think: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2). So invalid.

  - ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent, and C is out.

  - ""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> T absent and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

  - This pattern seems difficult. Maybe put D at 1.

Pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a common word. ""Damed"" might be a variant, but let's avoid.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.
- ""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4 -> I absent, and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

We need E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Possible: ""DADDY"" -> no E at 4.

""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.

""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.

""DANDY"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""DAILY"" and ""DANCE"" are out.

What about ""DAMED""? D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D. But we don't know if D is duplicated. If we use this, and if the word has only one D, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better option.

But ""damed"" is not a standard word. Let me think of common words.

""DAVIT"": but I at 4? We need E at 4.

""DAWED"": D at 1, A at 2, W at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""dawed"" is not common.

""DAZED"": D at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

This pattern is difficult without using absent letters.

Now, case 2: A at 5, E at 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ E A

D must be at position 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DWEPT"": not a word.
- ""DUPED"": D at 1, U at 2 -> U absent.
- ""DWEEB"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""ABREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA D"": no, duplicate? ""AREDE"" -> R absent.
- ""DODEA"": not a word.
- ""HOMED"": H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5? This has D at 5. We need A at 5.

We need the last letter to be A.

So: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""AREA"" is 4 letters.
- ""OAKED"": O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5, not at 2. This has A at 2.

We need the word to end with ""EA"", but with E at 4 and A at 5: so the last two letters are ""EA"".

So pattern: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""BREAD"": B at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""CREAM"": C absent.
- ""DREAD"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""FREED"": F at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""WRECK"": no A.

We need the third letter to be D and the fourth E, and fifth A.

So: letter1, letter2, D, E, A.

Examples:
- ""PINED"": but no A? We need A at 5.

We need the word to end with ""DEA"".

Common words: ""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3? But we need E at 4 and A at 5. Here E is at 3 and A at 5? No, pattern is _ _ D E A, so E at 4 and A at 5.

So: ""??DEA""

Examples:
- ""ABREA"" -> not a word.
- ""AREA"" -> too short.
- ""AUDEA"": not a word.

Actually, ""DEA"" at the end: ""DEA"" is not common. We need a 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"".

There are not many English words ending with ""DEA"". The most common is ""opera"" but that's O-P-E-R-A, which is O(1),P(2),E(3),R(4),A(5). But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 3 and R at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A.

So the word must end with ""EA"", but that would be positions 4 and 5: E at 4, A at 5. But in ""opera"", E is at 3 and A at 5? No: positions:
Position 1: O
Position 2: P
Position 3: E
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

So it's O-P-E-R-A, which is not _ _ D E A.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A. So the last two letters must be ""EA"", but that would be: position 4 = E, position 5 = A. So the word ends with ""EA"".

But in the pattern _ _ D E A, the fourth letter is E and fifth is A, so the last two are E and then A? No: the pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: D, 4: E, 5: A.

So the word ends with ""DEA"", not ""EA"". ""DEA"" means decommission, but it's 3 letters? 5-letter words ending with ""DEA"" are rare.

Common words: ""opera"" ends with ""A"", not ""DEA"".

Actually, I can't think of any common 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"". The only one I can think of is ""opera"", but that has E at position 3, not 4.

We need E at position 4 and A at position 5: so the word must be ...E A, meaning position 4 is E and position 5 is A.

But ""DEA"" is not a common ending. For example, ""MEDIA"" is M-E-D-I-A, which is positions: M(1), E(2), D(3), I(4), A(5). So E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5. But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 2 and D at 3.

We need E at 4 and A at 5: so the word must have the fourth letter E and fifth A.

But ""DEA"" is not a standard ending. Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern for A at 5 and E at 4: the word should be ? ? ? E A.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is P-I-Z-Z-A, no E.

""JUMBA"" no E.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that A might be at 2.

Back to case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to place D in 1,3, or 5.

But if we put D at 1: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5, and avoid absent letters.

Position 3: must be a letter, and position 5: must be a letter.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a standard word. ""Damned"" is 6 letters.
- ""DADDY"": no E at 4.
- ""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.
- ""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.
- ""DAPER"": D at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R absent.

It's hard to find words without the absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"": but we have B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5? But we have D at 5. And ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D. So positions: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters? B, K, D are not absent? We haven't tried B or K. So it's possible.

But in this word, we are putting A at 2 (which is allowed) and D at 5. We also test B and K.

But we have E at 4, which is fixed.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).

But we have to check if D can be at 5. Yes, because we haven't tried D at 5.

Similarly, we can try ""MAKED"": not a word.

""PAVED"": P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Also a candidate.

""HAVED"": H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""WADED"": W(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5) -> duplicate D, and D at 3 and 5? But we are putting D at 3 and 5? But we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""waDED"" has two D's.

But we can try, but it might be messy.

""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" are better.

But we also have the option to put D at position 3.

For example, pattern: _ A D E _

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Examples:
- ""BADGE"": B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, G at 4? But we need E at 4, not G. So no.
- ""BADE"": too short.
- ""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""haded"" is not common.
- ""MADED"": not a word.
- ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

It seems difficult to find a word with E at 4 and D at 3 without using absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" we have.

But we also have the possibility of A at 5.

If A at 5, then pattern: _ _ _ E A

And D must be at 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DUEA"": not 5 letters.
- ""DECEA"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""OPREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA"": too short.
- ""UREDA"": U at 1, R at 2 -> U and R absent.
- ""ENDEA"": not a word.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, and A is at 2 or 5.

We can try a word that tests A at 2 and also tests other possibilities.

But we have to include D.

Let me list possible words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- Position 4: E
- A must be at 2 or 5.
- D is present, not at 2, so at 1,3,5.

But if A is at 5, then D cannot be at 5 (same position), so D must be at 1 or 3.

If A is at 2, then D can be at 1,3,5.

But we need to find a word that exists.

Perhaps ""BAKED"" is a good choice: it tests A at 2 and D at 5, and we test B and K.

Similarly, ""PAVED"" tests P and V.

But we also have the option to test A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2? But we need E at 4, not at 2. In ""MEDIA"", E is at 2, not 4.

We need E at 4.

So for A at 5 and E at 4: we need a word ending with ""EA"", but as we saw, there are few.

""DEA"" is not common. The only one I know is ""opera"", but that doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think we have to consider that A might be at 2.

So let's go with ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests:
- A at 2: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then A must be at 5.
- D at 5: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.
- We test B and K.

If we get feedback that A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and D must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, if D is not at 5, then D is at 1 or 3.

But we also test B and K.

Another candidate: ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are known to be present, and B, K are new).

Similarly, ""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D.

Both are valid words.

We can also consider ""HATED"": but T is absent.

""MADED"": not a word.

""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D. So positions: W(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters.

So ""WAVED"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BAKED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".

Now, which one to choose?

We want to test new letters. We have not tried: B, K, P, V, W, M, etc.

""BAKED"" tests B and K.
""PAVED"" tests P and V.
""WAVED"" tests W and V.

We can choose ""WAVED"" because W is a common letter? Or ""BAKED"" because K is common.

But we also have to consider that if A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and we can adjust.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have two known letters (A and D) to place, and we need to find the other two.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A at 5 and D at 1 or 3, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""DOZEN"": but N absent and E at 4? ""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N, so E at 4? Actually: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent and A is missing.

We need A at 5.

""DEBAR"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, A at 4? But A cannot be at 4 (from guess2). And E at 2? We need E at 4.

Not matching.

""DOULA"": no E at 4.

I think we have to go with one of the ""BAKED"" type words.

But let me check if there is a word with A at 5 and E at 4.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is not ending with EA.

""JUMBA"" no E.

""KARMA"": K at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3 -> L absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

Perhaps ""DEUCE"": but C absent and E at 2.

I think we have to accept that A is at 2 for now, and test that.

So let's choose ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting A at 2 and D at 5.

If A is at 2, then we get a hit for A. If not, then A must be at 5.

Similarly, for D: we are putting D at 5. If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B and K.

So ""BAKED"" is a good test.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""BAKED"" seems fine.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BAKED"" is valid.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"" has E at 2, not 4.

""OCEAN"": O at 1, C at 2 -> C absent.

""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3 -> E at 3 is not 4.

I think we have to stick with A at 2.

So guess: ""BAKED""

But in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4, which is correct, and A at 2, D at 5.

We also test B and K.

If the feedback shows:
- If A is at 2, we get a hit. If not, we know A is at 5.
- If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

And we test B and K.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another common word: ""BALED"" but L absent.

""BAKED"" is okay.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. In ""BAKED"", we have B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are present, B, K not tried).

So let's go with ""BAKED"".

But wait, in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a new position.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D.

But ""BAKED"" is fine.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5 without using absent letters.

For example, ""DEWAR"": not a word.

""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4 -> U absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N absent and I absent.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, our fourth guess: ""BAKED""

But let's confirm the feedback we expect if A is at 2 and D at 5, but we don't know if that's the case.

We are testing the hypothesis.

If the word is ""BAKED"", we might get lucky.

But if not, we get information.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar but with P and V instead of B and K.

But B and K are as common as P and V? Actually, K is more common than V.

But both are valid.

I think ""BAKED"" is better.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""BAKED"" is standard.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try to test A at 5.

But I can't find a common word with E at 4 and A at 5.

So let's stick with ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a position we are testing.

If D is at 5, we get a hit. If not, we know D is at 1 or 3.

Similarly, for A: we are putting at 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So it's good.

We can also consider ""DAVIT"", but I at 3? And we need E at 4, not I.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there is a word like ""DEWAR"" but it's not English.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""BAKED"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have E at 4 correct? Actually, in ""adieu"", E was at 4 and we got a check, so E is at 4.

So in ""BAKED"", E at 4 is correct, so we expect that.

A at 2: we are testing if it's correct.

D at 5: testing if it's correct.

B and K: new letters.

So let's do it.

<guess>baked</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 3: E(✓)).
- **A is present** but cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4 (from Guesses 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
- **D is present** but not at position 2 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with A and D needing to be placed).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **D**.
- **E must be at position 4**.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, K) to gather more information.
- Prioritize resolving the positions of A and D.

**""BAKED""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 2 (testing if A is at position 2).
- Places **D** at position 5 (testing if D is at position 5).
- Keeps **E** at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- Tests new letters **B** and **K** (common consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and D while testing two new letters.",Guess 4: baked -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) D(✓),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, A was in position 3 and E in position 5 of ""crane"", so in the secret word, A is not at position 3 and E is not at position 5.
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

 We can eliminate any word that contains C, R, or N.
 Also, the word must contain A and E.

 Since A and E are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively, we need to try a word that places A and E in different positions.

 We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain C, R, N.
 - Contains A and E.
 - Places A not at position 3 and E not at position 5.

 We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants that we haven't tried: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has S, T, and other common letters, and also includes A and E in new positions.

 Let's try to put A in a different position, say position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we know E is not at position 5, so E can be in 1,2,3,4.

 However, we must avoid the positions that we know are wrong for A and E.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's try the word ""SLATE"", but note:
 - S: we don't know about S.
 - L: we don't know about L.
 - A: we know A is in the word, but in ""SLATE"", A is at position 3. However, our feedback said A is not at position 3 (from the first guess). So we cannot put A at position 3 again. Therefore, ""SLATE"" is not a good choice because it puts A at position 3.

 We need a word that has A and E, and avoids C, R, N, and places A not at 3 and E not at 5.

 Let's try ""STALE"":
 - S at position 1
 - T at position 2
 - A at position 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, the feedback from the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

 We need to put A in a position that is not 3. Let's try position 1: 
 Example: ""ADIEU"" but that has D, I, U and E at the end? But we know E is not at position 5. So we cannot put E at position 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AISLE"":
 - A at position 1 (which is new)
 - I at position 2
 - S at position 3
 - L at position 4
 - E at position 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at position 5.

 Let's try ""AEGIS"": 
 - A at position 1
 - E at position 2
 - G at position 3
 - I at position 4
 - S at position 5

 But note: we don't know if G, I, S are in the word. Also, we are testing new letters.

 However, we must avoid the known incorrect positions: 
   For A: we know it's not at 3 -> we are putting it at 1, which is okay.
   For E: we know it's not at 5 -> we are putting it at 2, which is okay.

 But wait, the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at 3, and E is in the word but not at 5. So ""AEGIS"" is a valid try? 

 However, we are not sure if the word has G, I, S. We are trying to test new letters.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common letters and avoids the known absent letters.

 Another idea: ""SAUTE""
 - S at 1
 - A at 2 (new position for A)
 - U at 3
 - T at 4
 - E at 5 -> but we know E is not at 5? So that's not allowed.

 We must avoid E at 5.

 Let's try ""STEAL"":
 - S at 1
 - T at 2
 - E at 3
 - A at 4
 - L at 5

 This way:
   A is at position 4 (not 3) -> okay
   E is at position 3 (not 5) -> okay

 And we test S, T, L.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, T, L. This is a good way to test them.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STEAL"" is a valid English word.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at position 4, which is different. So that's good.

 Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that's good.

 Let's go with ""STEAL"".

 However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

 But let me check: we are using S, T, E, A, L. We know A and E are in the word, and S, T, L are new.

 This is a good way to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"" but we cannot because A would be at position 3 (which is forbidden). So that's out.

 Another option: ""TALES""
 - T at 1
 - A at 2
 - L at 3
 - E at 4
 - S at 5

 This puts A at 2 (not 3) and E at 4 (not 5). So that's acceptable.

 But note: we are trying to maximize information. ""STEAL"" and ""TALES"" are both good.

 However, we have to consider that the secret word has A and E, and we are testing three new letters (S, T, L) in ""STEAL"" and two new letters (T, L, S) in ""TALES"". Actually, both test 3 new letters.

 But we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can choose either. Let's go with ""STEAL"" because it uses common letters.

 So, our second guess: ""STEAL""

<guess>steal</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is present but not in position 3 (marked ""-"").
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E** (since they are in the word).
- **A** cannot be in position 3, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, N** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L**) to gather more information.

The word **""STEAL""** fits these criteria:
- Places **A** at position 4 (not 3).
- Places **E** at position 3 (not 5).
- Tests **S, T, L** (new letters).
- Excludes **C, R, N**.

This maximizes information while adhering to the feedback.

<guess>steal</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (not in the word)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but not at position 3)  [since it was at position 3 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- A: - (in the word, but not at position 4)  [since it was at position 4 in this guess and marked as wrong position]
- L: x (not in the word)

So, what we know so far:
- The secret word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
  - From guess 1: A is not at position 3, E is not at position 5.
  - From guess 2: E is not at position 3, A is not at position 4.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word).
- Does not include C, R, N, S, T, L.
- Places A and E in positions that are still possible (i.e., not the ones we've tried and failed).

Possible positions for A: It cannot be at 3 (from guess1) or 4 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 5.
Possible positions for E: It cannot be at 5 (from guess1) or 3 (from guess2). So it can be at 1, 2, or 4.

But note: we cannot put A and E in the same position? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

What letters have we not tried? We have tried: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, L.

So absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L.

We have two known letters: A and E.

We need to choose a word that has A and E, and three new letters that are not in the absent list.

We also need to place A and E in positions that are still allowed.

Let's list the allowed positions for A: 1, 2, 5
For E: 1, 2, 4

But note: we cannot have both A and E at the same position? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient. We should try to put them in positions we haven't tested.

We also want to test common letters that we haven't tried. The remaining common letters include: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should avoid using letters that are less common to maximize information.

Let's try to form a word that has A and E, and three new letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Place A at position 1 and E at position 2? But we don't know if that's allowed. We haven't tried that.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. So we can try:

Word: A _ _ _ _ 
But we also need E somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try A at position 1 and E at position 4? That would be: A _ _ E _

But we need to fill the middle.

Let me think of words that have A and E, and avoid the absent letters.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""ABIDE"": A at 1, B at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is forbidden (from guess1). So not allowed.
- ""AGREE"": has two E's, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, duplicates are possible. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That's 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that's 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not allowed.

We need to avoid E at 5 and R at all.

Another word: ""ADOBE"": A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""ALIKE"": but L is absent (from guess2) and I at 3? But L is out.

""AMUSE"": A at 1, M at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> S is absent (from guess2) and E at 5 is forbidden.

We must avoid S, T, L, C, R, N.

Let me try to think of words with A and E, without the absent letters.

Possible: ""ABIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""ABOVE"": A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""AWAKE"": A at 1, W at 2, A at 3 (duplicate? but we don't know if duplicate A is allowed) -> but we have A at 1 and 3. We know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, we are not sure. But we can try? But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. W is new. But what about the second A? We don't know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn't have E.

We need a word that has both A and E.

Another idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.

""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed? But we have E at 4. And A at 2. But L is absent.

We need to avoid T, L, S, etc.

Let me try ""OAKEN"": but O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> but N is absent (from guess1) and we have E at 4 (allowed) and A at 2 (allowed). But N is absent.

Another: ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be at 4. And A at 2 is allowed. And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's possible.

But note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.

Similarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.

""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.

""MAKER"" is out.

""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed. Letters: P, A, V, E, D. All new and not absent.

But is ""PAVED"" a word? Yes, meaning to have been in office or position for a long time.

Another option: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent. Not allowed.

""WAIVED"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

""WAIVE"": only 5 letters? W-A-I-V-E -> that's 5: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is forbidden.

""PAVED"" seems okay: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try to put A at 5? Because we haven't tried that.

For example: ""PIECE"": P at 1, I at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is allowed? Yes, but we already know E is not at position 3 from guess2? Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.

So for E: we know it's not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.

Similarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.

Now, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.

For example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.

""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or E.

We need both A and E.

Another: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1). So no.

""PLACE"": P at 1, L at 2 -> L is absent.

""TRACE"": T and C are absent.

""BLADE"": B at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""SHADE"": S and L absent.

""PHASE"": S and L absent.

""GRAPE"": G at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.

""PLACE"" is out.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""RAISE"": R and S absent.

""VALET"": V at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""PAVED"" seems good: A at 2, E at 4.

But we can also try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.

So we cannot put A at 4.

If we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.

For example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.

""JAZZY"" -> no E.

""AROMA"" -> no E.

We need E.

""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> 
- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)
- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)
- Letters: M, E, D, I, A. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that's valid.

""MEDIA"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""BEIGE"": B at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden and also duplicate E? But we don't know if duplicate E is allowed. But we can try? However, E at 5 is forbidden.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent.

""VEIL"": only 4 letters.

""DEVIL"": D at 1, E at 2, V at 3, I at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.

""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent and E at 5? Also, L is absent.

""HEAVE"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""MEANY"": M at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""BEADY"" is invalid.

""OAKEN"": N absent.

""BAKED"": E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but we have E at 4 and D at 5. And A at 2. So: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is ""BAKED"". But we have E at 4? Yes. And A at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 2 and it's not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.

Similarly, E at 4 is new.

But note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.

And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate.

But we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.

Both are valid.

We can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.

We need to choose one that tests more common letters.

We have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.

""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.

""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.

We want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.

Common letters: D, M, P, B, etc.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven't tried A at 2 or E at 4.

Alternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.

""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.

""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.

""EMBARK"": too long.

""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.

""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H's? But we don't know about duplicates.

But we are avoiding N, etc.

""OPAQUE"": too long.

""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.

""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don't know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D's? And we don't know if D is in the word. But it's acceptable.

But we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.

So ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.

""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.

But ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.

We can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.

Another word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.

""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAVE"": L absent.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REAVE"": R absent.

""SEAVE"": S absent.

""TAPE"": too short.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.

But note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.

In ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.

We also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.

We know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.

Similarly for ""MEDIA"".

But we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.

What about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. 
- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)
- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)
- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.

And distinct letters.

""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.

But ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). 

But we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.

So ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":

- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.
- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.
- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.
- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.

We want to test the position for A and E that we haven't tried. We haven't tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.

In ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That's two new positions.

In ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

In ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.

In ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.

""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.

""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? 

But we don't know.

Another candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.

""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.

""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.

""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.

""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.

""REACT"": R and T absent.

""SEIZE"": S absent.

""TEASE"": T and S absent.

So ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.

Also, it tests I and U, which are vowels.

But we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don't know if there are more vowels.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.

Another word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.

""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.

""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""RADIO"": R absent.

""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.

""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.

""WAIFT"": not common.

""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.

So ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.

But let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.

We can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.

""ABYSS"": no E.

I think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.

But note: we are putting A at 1. We don't know if that's correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.

Similarly, E at 4.

So let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it's safe.

Therefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""

But let me double-check the positions:
- A at 1: not tried before -> possible
- D at 2: new
- I at 3: new
- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)
- U at 5: new

This will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.

If A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it's not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.

We also test I and U.

So it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.

But ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.

I think either is fine. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

<guess>adieu</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).
- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).
  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.
  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.
  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **E**.
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).
- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.
- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven't been ruled out.

**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).
- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoids all absent letters.

This guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>adieu</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: adieu -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) I(x) E(✓) U(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 3)
- A: - (present, but not at position 4)
- L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""adieu""
- A: - (present, but not at position 1)
- D: - (present, but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
- U: x (absent)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct position**: 
   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).

2. **Present letters** (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):
   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from guess 1), not at position 4 (from guess 2), and not at position 1 (from guess 3). So A cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
   - D: present, but not at position 2 (from guess 3). So D is in the word, but not at position 2.

3. **Absent letters**: 
   - From all guesses: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.

4. **Letters we know are in the word**:
   - A (must be at 2 or 5)
   - E (at position 4)
   - D (present, not at 2)

Also, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 3 known: A, E, D, but one of them might be duplicated? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet).

The word structure so far: 
Position 1: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 1, and not the absent letters)
Position 2: could be A? or D? or another letter
Position 3: unknown (but not A, because A can't be at 3, and not absent letters)
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: could be A? (since A can be at 5) or another letter.

We know A is at 2 or 5. But we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Has E at position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Includes A and D (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.
- Tries to test A at position 2 or 5 and D at a position that is not 2.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available positions for A: 2 or 5.
Available positions for D: 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because D cannot be at 2).

We can try to put A at position 2 and D at position 1 or 3 or 5? But we have to fill the other positions with new letters.

Alternatively, we can put A at position 5 and D at position 1, 3, or 2? But D cannot be at 2, so only 1 or 3.

Let's think of words that have E at 4, and include A and D, without the absent letters.

We also need to consider that we have two unknown letters (if A is at 2, then we have positions 1, 3, and 5 to fill; if A is at 5, then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill, and D must be in one of 1,3,5 but not 2).

Case 1: A at position 2.
Then the word: _ A _ E _
We need to place D in one of positions 1, 3, or 5, and the remaining two positions must be filled with new letters (not absent and not A,E,D).

Case 2: A at position 5.
Then the word: _ _ _ E A
D must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 2, and 5 is taken by A).

We can try to test one of these cases.

But we also want to test new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, for case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Word pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to put D in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.

But note: if we put D at 1, then the word: D A _ E _
If we put D at 3: _ A D E _
If we put D at 5: _ A _ E D

We also need to fill the other positions with new letters.

Available letters: we have not tried: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others.

Let's try to find valid words.

- For pattern _ A D E _: 
  - The third letter must be D and fourth E? So _ A D E _
  - Examples: ""BADED"" -> but B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""BADED"" is not a common word? Actually, ""baded"" is not standard. Maybe ""bade"" is the past tense, but we need 5 letters. ""BADED"" is not a word.

  - ""MADED"": M at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""madded"" is not a common word. The past tense is ""maded""? Not really. Actually, ""maded"" is not valid.

  - ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""padded"" is a word. But duplicate D? We don't know if D is duplicated. But we can try? However, we are testing D at 3, but if D is duplicated, we might get confusing feedback.

  - ""WADDY"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, D at 4? But E must be at 4, so not. We have E at 4.

  - This pattern is hard. Let me think: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2). So invalid.

  - ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent, and C is out.

  - ""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> T absent and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

  - This pattern seems difficult. Maybe put D at 1.

Pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a common word. ""Damed"" might be a variant, but let's avoid.
- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.
- ""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4 -> I absent, and E not at 4? We need E at 4.

We need E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.

So pattern: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5.

Possible: ""DADDY"" -> no E at 4.

""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.

""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.

""DANDY"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.

""DAILY"" and ""DANCE"" are out.

What about ""DAMED""? D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D. But we don't know if D is duplicated. If we use this, and if the word has only one D, we might get confusing feedback. But it's acceptable if we don't have a better option.

But ""damed"" is not a standard word. Let me think of common words.

""DAVIT"": but I at 4? We need E at 4.

""DAWED"": D at 1, A at 2, W at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""dawed"" is not common.

""DAZED"": D at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

This pattern is difficult without using absent letters.

Now, case 2: A at 5, E at 4.

Pattern: _ _ _ E A

D must be at position 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DWEPT"": not a word.
- ""DUPED"": D at 1, U at 2 -> U absent.
- ""DWEEB"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""ABREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA D"": no, duplicate? ""AREDE"" -> R absent.
- ""DODEA"": not a word.
- ""HOMED"": H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5? This has D at 5. We need A at 5.

We need the last letter to be A.

So: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""AREA"" is 4 letters.
- ""OAKED"": O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5, not at 2. This has A at 2.

We need the word to end with ""EA"", but with E at 4 and A at 5: so the last two letters are ""EA"".

So pattern: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""BREAD"": B at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""CREAM"": C absent.
- ""DREAD"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""FREED"": F at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""WRECK"": no A.

We need the third letter to be D and the fourth E, and fifth A.

So: letter1, letter2, D, E, A.

Examples:
- ""PINED"": but no A? We need A at 5.

We need the word to end with ""DEA"".

Common words: ""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3? But we need E at 4 and A at 5. Here E is at 3 and A at 5? No, pattern is _ _ D E A, so E at 4 and A at 5.

So: ""??DEA""

Examples:
- ""ABREA"" -> not a word.
- ""AREA"" -> too short.
- ""AUDEA"": not a word.

Actually, ""DEA"" at the end: ""DEA"" is not common. We need a 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"".

There are not many English words ending with ""DEA"". The most common is ""opera"" but that's O-P-E-R-A, which is O(1),P(2),E(3),R(4),A(5). But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 3 and R at 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A.

So the word must end with ""EA"", but that would be positions 4 and 5: E at 4, A at 5. But in ""opera"", E is at 3 and A at 5? No: positions:
Position 1: O
Position 2: P
Position 3: E
Position 4: R
Position 5: A

So it's O-P-E-R-A, which is not _ _ D E A.

We need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A. So the last two letters must be ""EA"", but that would be: position 4 = E, position 5 = A. So the word ends with ""EA"".

But in the pattern _ _ D E A, the fourth letter is E and fifth is A, so the last two are E and then A? No: the pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: D, 4: E, 5: A.

So the word ends with ""DEA"", not ""EA"". ""DEA"" means decommission, but it's 3 letters? 5-letter words ending with ""DEA"" are rare.

Common words: ""opera"" ends with ""A"", not ""DEA"".

Actually, I can't think of any common 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"". The only one I can think of is ""opera"", but that has E at position 3, not 4.

We need E at position 4 and A at position 5: so the word must be ...E A, meaning position 4 is E and position 5 is A.

But ""DEA"" is not a common ending. For example, ""MEDIA"" is M-E-D-I-A, which is positions: M(1), E(2), D(3), I(4), A(5). So E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5. But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 2 and D at 3.

We need E at 4 and A at 5: so the word must have the fourth letter E and fifth A.

But ""DEA"" is not a standard ending. Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think I have a mistake: the pattern for A at 5 and E at 4: the word should be ? ? ? E A.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is P-I-Z-Z-A, no E.

""JUMBA"" no E.

This is difficult. Maybe we should consider that A might be at 2.

Back to case 1: A at 2, E at 4.

Pattern: _ A _ E _

We need to place D in 1,3, or 5.

But if we put D at 1: D A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 and 5, and avoid absent letters.

Position 3: must be a letter, and position 5: must be a letter.

Examples:
- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a standard word. ""Damned"" is 6 letters.
- ""DADDY"": no E at 4.
- ""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.
- ""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.
- ""DAPER"": D at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R absent.

It's hard to find words without the absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"": but we have B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5? But we have D at 5. And ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D. So positions: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters? B, K, D are not absent? We haven't tried B or K. So it's possible.

But in this word, we are putting A at 2 (which is allowed) and D at 5. We also test B and K.

But we have E at 4, which is fixed.

So ""BAKED"" is a candidate: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).

But we have to check if D can be at 5. Yes, because we haven't tried D at 5.

Similarly, we can try ""MAKED"": not a word.

""PAVED"": P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Also a candidate.

""HAVED"": H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""WADED"": W(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5) -> duplicate D, and D at 3 and 5? But we are putting D at 3 and 5? But we don't know if D is duplicated. Also, ""waDED"" has two D's.

But we can try, but it might be messy.

""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" are better.

But we also have the option to put D at position 3.

For example, pattern: _ A D E _

We need a letter for position 1 and 5.

Examples:
- ""BADGE"": B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, G at 4? But we need E at 4, not G. So no.
- ""BADE"": too short.
- ""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""haded"" is not common.
- ""MADED"": not a word.
- ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

It seems difficult to find a word with E at 4 and D at 3 without using absent letters.

What about ""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" we have.

But we also have the possibility of A at 5.

If A at 5, then pattern: _ _ _ E A

And D must be at 1 or 3.

If D at 1: D _ _ E A

Examples:
- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.
- ""DUEA"": not 5 letters.
- ""DECEA"": not a word.

If D at 3: _ _ D E A

Examples:
- ""OPREA"": not a word.
- ""AREA"": too short.
- ""UREDA"": U at 1, R at 2 -> U and R absent.
- ""ENDEA"": not a word.

This is challenging.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.

Another idea: we know E is at 4, and A is at 2 or 5.

We can try a word that tests A at 2 and also tests other possibilities.

But we have to include D.

Let me list possible words that fit the constraints.

We know:
- Position 4: E
- A must be at 2 or 5.
- D is present, not at 2, so at 1,3,5.

But if A is at 5, then D cannot be at 5 (same position), so D must be at 1 or 3.

If A is at 2, then D can be at 1,3,5.

But we need to find a word that exists.

Perhaps ""BAKED"" is a good choice: it tests A at 2 and D at 5, and we test B and K.

Similarly, ""PAVED"" tests P and V.

But we also have the option to test A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2? But we need E at 4, not at 2. In ""MEDIA"", E is at 2, not 4.

We need E at 4.

So for A at 5 and E at 4: we need a word ending with ""EA"", but as we saw, there are few.

""DEA"" is not common. The only one I know is ""opera"", but that doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.

I think we have to consider that A might be at 2.

So let's go with ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests:
- A at 2: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then A must be at 5.
- D at 5: if it's correct, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.
- We test B and K.

If we get feedback that A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and D must be at 1 or 3.

Similarly, if D is not at 5, then D is at 1 or 3.

But we also test B and K.

Another candidate: ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5.

This tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

We can choose one.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are known to be present, and B, K are new).

Similarly, ""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D.

Both are valid words.

We can also consider ""HATED"": but T is absent.

""MADED"": not a word.

""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D. So positions: W(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters.

So ""WAVED"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""BAKED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".

Now, which one to choose?

We want to test new letters. We have not tried: B, K, P, V, W, M, etc.

""BAKED"" tests B and K.
""PAVED"" tests P and V.
""WAVED"" tests W and V.

We can choose ""WAVED"" because W is a common letter? Or ""BAKED"" because K is common.

But we also have to consider that if A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and we can adjust.

But we are on the fourth guess, and we have two known letters (A and D) to place, and we need to find the other two.

Another idea: we can try a word that has A at 5 and D at 1 or 3, but we need a valid word.

For example, ""DOZEN"": but N absent and E at 4? ""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N, so E at 4? Actually: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent and A is missing.

We need A at 5.

""DEBAR"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, A at 4? But A cannot be at 4 (from guess2). And E at 2? We need E at 4.

Not matching.

""DOULA"": no E at 4.

I think we have to go with one of the ""BAKED"" type words.

But let me check if there is a word with A at 5 and E at 4.

For example, ""PIZZA"" is not ending with EA.

""JUMBA"" no E.

""KARMA"": K at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.

""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3 -> L absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

Perhaps ""DEUCE"": but C absent and E at 2.

I think we have to accept that A is at 2 for now, and test that.

So let's choose ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting A at 2 and D at 5.

If A is at 2, then we get a hit for A. If not, then A must be at 5.

Similarly, for D: we are putting D at 5. If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

Also, we test B and K.

So ""BAKED"" is a good test.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""BAKED"" seems fine.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BAKED"" is valid.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5.

For example, ""MEDIA"" has E at 2, not 4.

""OCEAN"": O at 1, C at 2 -> C absent.

""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3 -> E at 3 is not 4.

I think we have to stick with A at 2.

So guess: ""BAKED""

But in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4, which is correct, and A at 2, D at 5.

We also test B and K.

If the feedback shows:
- If A is at 2, we get a hit. If not, we know A is at 5.
- If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.

And we test B and K.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar.

But ""BAKED"" is more common.

Another common word: ""BALED"" but L absent.

""BAKED"" is okay.

But we have to avoid the absent letters. In ""BAKED"", we have B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are present, B, K not tried).

So let's go with ""BAKED"".

But wait, in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a new position.

We can also consider ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D.

But ""BAKED"" is fine.

I think ""BAKED"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5 without using absent letters.

For example, ""DEWAR"": not a word.

""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4 -> U absent and E at 2 not 4.

No.

""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N absent and I absent.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, our fourth guess: ""BAKED""

But let's confirm the feedback we expect if A is at 2 and D at 5, but we don't know if that's the case.

We are testing the hypothesis.

If the word is ""BAKED"", we might get lucky.

But if not, we get information.

We can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar but with P and V instead of B and K.

But B and K are as common as P and V? Actually, K is more common than V.

But both are valid.

I think ""BAKED"" is better.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.

""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""BAKED"" is standard.

So I'll go with ""BAKED"".

But we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try to test A at 5.

But I can't find a common word with E at 4 and A at 5.

So let's stick with ""BAKED"".

But in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a position we are testing.

If D is at 5, we get a hit. If not, we know D is at 1 or 3.

Similarly, for A: we are putting at 2, which is one of the possibilities.

So it's good.

We can also consider ""DAVIT"", but I at 3? And we need E at 4, not I.

No.

So I think ""BAKED"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there is a word like ""DEWAR"" but it's not English.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is ""BAKED"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have E at 4 correct? Actually, in ""adieu"", E was at 4 and we got a check, so E is at 4.

So in ""BAKED"", E at 4 is correct, so we expect that.

A at 2: we are testing if it's correct.

D at 5: testing if it's correct.

B and K: new letters.

So let's do it.

<guess>baked</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 3: E(✓)).
- **A is present** but cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4 (from Guesses 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.
- **D is present** but not at position 2 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with A and D needing to be placed).

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **D**.
- **E must be at position 4**.
- Avoid all absent letters.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, K) to gather more information.
- Prioritize resolving the positions of A and D.

**""BAKED""** is chosen because:
- Places **A** at position 2 (testing if A is at position 2).
- Places **D** at position 5 (testing if D is at position 5).
- Keeps **E** at position 4 (confirmed correct).
- Tests new letters **B** and **K** (common consonants).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U).

This guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and D while testing two new letters.

This is a good way to test them.\n\n However, we must ensure that the word is valid. ""STEAL"" is a valid English word.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said that A is in the word but not at position 3. In ""STEAL"", A is at position 4, which is different. So that\'s good.\n\n Similarly, E is at position 3, which is not 5. So that\'s good.\n\n Let\'s go with ""STEAL"".\n\n However, note that the word must contain A and E, and we are including them. Also, we are avoiding C, R, N.\n\n So, our second guess: ""STEAL""\n\n But let me check: we are using S, T, E, A, L.

However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so far. But we cannot use R (which is absent) and G is new. But note: ""AGREE"" has E at position 5? Actually, ""AGREE"" is A-G-R-E-E-E? That\'s 6 letters. Oh, 5-letter: ""AGREE"" is 5 letters? A-G-R-E-E -> that\'s 5: A(1), G(2), R(3), E(4), E(5). But R is absent (from guess1) and E at 5 is forbidden. So not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid E at 5 and R at all.\n\nAnother word: ""ADOBE"": A at 1, D at 2, O at 3, B at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""ALIKE"": but L is absent (from guess2) and I at 3? But L is out.\n\n""AMUSE"": A at 1, M at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> S is absent (from guess2) and E at 5 is forbidden.\n\nWe must avoid S, T, L, C, R, N.\n\nLet me try to think of words with A and E, without the absent letters.\n\nPossible: ""ABIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n""ABOVE"": A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""AWAKE"": A at 1, W at 2, A at 3 (duplicate? but we don\'t know if duplicate A is allowed) -> but we have A at 1 and 3. We know A is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. However, we are not sure. But we can try? But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. W is new. But what about the second A? We don\'t know. Also, E is missing? We need E. ""AWAKE"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe need a word that has both A and E.\n\nAnother idea: ""EAGLE"": but E at 1 (which is allowed), A at 2 (allowed, because A can be at 2), G at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> but L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""MAPLE"": M at 1, A at 2, P at 3, L at 4, E at 5 -> L is absent and E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2).\n\n""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent and E at 4 is allowed? But we have E at 4. And A at 2. But L is absent.\n\nWe need to avoid T, L, S, etc.\n\nLet me try ""OAKEN"": but O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> but N is absent (from guess1) and we have E at 4 (allowed) and A at 2 (allowed). But N is absent.\n\nAnother: ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed? Yes, because E can be at 4. And A at 2 is allowed. And the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that\'s possible.\n\nBut note: we are testing new letters: B, K, D.\n\nSimilarly, we could try ""MAKER"": but R is absent and K at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R is absent.\n\n""BAKER"": same issue, R absent.\n\n""MAKER"" is out.\n\n""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> E at 4 is allowed, A at 2 is allowed. Letters: P, A, V, E, D. All new and not absent.\n\nBut is ""PAVED"" a word? Yes, meaning to have been in office or position for a long time.\n\nAnother option: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""WAIVED"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""WAIVE"": only 5 letters? W-A-I-V-E -> that\'s 5: W(1), A(2), I(3), V(4), E(5). But E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""PAVED"" seems okay: A at 2, E at 4.\n\nBut we can also try to put A at 5? Because we haven\'t tried that.\n\nFor example: ""PIECE"": P at 1, I at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is allowed? Yes, but we already know E is not at position 3 from guess2? Wait, no: in guess2, E was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at 3. So we cannot put E at 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at 3. So we should avoid putting E at 3.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A at 3 and 4.\n\nSo for E: we know it\'s not at 3 and 5. So we can only try positions 1,2,4.\n\nSimilarly for A: not at 3 and 4. So we can try 1,2,5.\n\nNow, if we put A at 5, then we need E somewhere else.\n\nFor example: ""DOZEN"": D at 1, O at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent and E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but N is absent.\n\n""MODEL"": M at 1, O at 2, D at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L is absent.\n\n""JUMBO"": no A or E.\n\nWe need both A and E.\n\nAnother: ""IMAGE"": I at 1, M at 2, A at 3 -> but A at 3 is forbidden (from guess1). So no.\n\n""PLACE"": P at 1, L at 2 -> L is absent.\n\n""TRACE"": T and C are absent.\n\n""BLADE"": B at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.\n\n""SHADE"": S and L absent.\n\n""PHASE"": S and L absent.\n\n""GRAPE"": G at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n\n""PLACE"" is out.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.\n\n""RAISE"": R and S absent.\n\n""VALET"": V at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.\n\n""HAZEL"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.\n\n""PAVED"" seems good: A at 2, E at 4.\n\nBut we can also try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid because of E at 5 and L.\n\n""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden (from guess2). We know A is not at 4.\n\nSo we cannot put A at 4.\n\nIf we put A at 5: then the word ends with A. And E must be at 1,2, or 4.\n\nFor example: ""PIZZA"" -> no E.\n\n""JAZZY"" -> no E.\n\n""AROMA"" -> no E.\n\nWe need E.\n\n""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5 -> \n- E at 2: allowed (since E can be at 2)\n- A at 5: allowed (since A can be at 5)\n- Letters: M, E, D, I, A. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So that\'s valid.\n\n""MEDIA"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""BEIGE"": B at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden and also duplicate E? But we don\'t know if duplicate E is allowed. But we can try? However, E at 5 is forbidden.\n\n""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N is absent.\n\n""VEIL"": only 4 letters.\n\n""DEVIL"": D at 1, E at 2, V at 3, I at 4, L at 5 -> L absent.\n\n""BEADY"": B at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is forbidden.\n\n""LEAVE"": L absent and E at 5? Also, L is absent.\n\n""HEAVE"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""PEACE"": P at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""MEANY"": M at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""BEADY"" is invalid.\n\n""OAKEN"": N absent.\n\n""BAKED"": E at 4 is allowed? Yes, but we have E at 4 and D at 5. And A at 2. So: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This is ""BAKED"". But we have E at 4? Yes. And A at 2 is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tried A at 2 and it\'s not forbidden for A? Actually, we know A is not at 3 and 4, but 2 is new.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4 is new.\n\nBut note: in ""BAKED"", A is at 2 and E at 4. Both are allowed positions.\n\nAnd the letters: B, A, K, E, D. None are absent.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we also have ""MEDIA"": M, E, D, I, A -> E at 2, A at 5.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAVED"": P, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nWe have not tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\n""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. We test B, K, D.\n\n""MEDIA"" uses M, E, D, I, A. We test M, D, I.\n\n""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D. We test P, V, D.\n\nWe want to maximize the number of new letters and common ones.\n\nCommon letters: D, M, P, B, etc.\n\nI think ""BAKED"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\nBut note: we are putting A at 2 and E at 4. We haven\'t tried A at 2 or E at 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try A at 5 and E at 1? For example: ""EAGLE"" is invalid.\n\n""ELAND"": E at 1, L at 2 -> L absent.\n\n""EMBAR"": E at 1, M at 2, B at 3, A at 4 -> but A at 4 is forbidden.\n\n""EMBARK"": too long.\n\n""ENACT"": E at 1, N at 2 -> N absent.\n\n""EPHAH"": E at 1, P at 2, H at 3, A at 4, H at 5 -> A at 4 is forbidden and duplicate H? Also, we have two H\'s? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nBut we are avoiding N, etc.\n\n""OPAQUE"": too long.\n\n""QUAKE"": Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""VAGUE"": V at 1, A at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""VAGUE"" is invalid because of E at 5.\n\n""WAIVE"": W at 1, A at 2, I at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""WADED"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? But we don\'t know. Also, E at 4 is allowed. But we have two D\'s? And we don\'t know if D is in the word. But it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are testing D and W. However, duplicate D might not be ideal because we get less information.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" seems better: all distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEDIA"" has distinct letters: M, E, D, I, A.\n\n""PAVED"" has distinct letters: P, A, V, E, D.\n\nBut ""PAVED"" has E at 4 and A at 2? Actually: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). So A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""BEADY"" but A at 3 is forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""DEUCE"": D at 1, E at 2, U at 3, C at 4 -> C is absent.\n\n""HEAVE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""LEAVE"": L absent.\n\n""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""REAVE"": R absent.\n\n""SEAVE"": S absent.\n\n""TAPE"": too short.\n\n""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" and ""MEDIA"" are good candidates.\n\nBut note: in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4 and A at 2. We also test B, K, D.\n\nIn ""MEDIA"", we have E at 2 and A at 5. We test M, D, I.\n\nWe also have to consider that we are on the third guess and we want to get as much information as possible.\n\nWe know the word has A and E, and we are trying to find their positions.\n\nIn ""BAKED"", we are testing A at 2 and E at 4. If we get a hit, we know the position. If not, we narrow down.\n\nSimilarly for ""MEDIA"".\n\nBut we have another option: ""ABIDE"" is invalid.\n\nWhat about ""ADIEU""? A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5. \n- A at 1: allowed (A can be at 1)\n- E at 4: allowed (E can be at 4)\n- Letters: A, D, I, E, U. None are absent.\n\nAnd distinct letters.\n\n""ADIEU"" is a common starting word, but now we are using it? Actually, we are not starting, we are on the third guess.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" is valid: A(1), D(2), I(3), E(4), U(5). \n\nBut we know that E is not at position 5? Actually, in ""ADIEU"", E is at 4, which is allowed. And A at 1 is allowed.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, comparing ""BAKED"", ""MEDIA"", ""PAVED"", and ""ADIEU"":\n\n- ""BAKED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and letters B, K, D.\n- ""MEDIA"": tests E at 2, A at 5, and M, D, I.\n- ""PAVED"": tests A at 2, E at 4, and P, V, D.\n- ""ADIEU"": tests A at 1, E at 4, and D, I, U.\n\nWe want to test the position for A and E that we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried A at 1,2,5 and E at 1,2,4.\n\nIn ""ADIEU"", we are trying A at 1 and E at 4. That\'s two new positions.\n\nIn ""BAKED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nIn ""MEDIA"", we are trying E at 2 and A at 5.\n\nIn ""PAVED"", we are trying A at 2 and E at 4.\n\nWe also want to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: D, M, P, U, I, etc.\n\n""ADIEU"" uses U and I, which are vowels, and D. It might be less common consonants.\n\n""BAKED"" uses B, K, D: B and K are less common than M or P? \n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""BEADY"" is invalid because of A at 3.\n\n""DEALT"": D at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""HEART"": H at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""LEAPT"": L absent and A at 3.\n\n""MEANY"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""PEACE"": A at 3 forbidden.\n\n""REACT"": R and T absent.\n\n""SEIZE"": S absent.\n\n""TEASE"": T and S absent.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" is a good option because it tests A at 1 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, it tests I and U, which are vowels.\n\nBut we already know the word has A and E, so we are testing other vowels? But we don\'t know if there are more vowels.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses more common consonants.\n\nAnother word: ""DANCE"": D at 1, D at 2 (duplicate?), A at 3 -> A at 3 forbidden, and duplicate D? Also, C and N are absent.\n\n""MANIA"": M at 1, A at 2, N at 2 (duplicate?), I at 3, A at 4 -> A at 4 forbidden and duplicate A? Also, N is absent.\n\n""PANIC"": P at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.\n\n""RADIO"": R absent.\n\n""VAGUE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\n""VAUNT"": V at 1, A at 2, U at 3, N at 4 -> N absent.\n\n""WAIFT"": not common.\n\n""WAIVE"": E at 5 forbidden.\n\nSo ""ADIEU"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""ADIEU"" is valid: yes, it is a word.\n\nWe can also consider ""OUIJA"": not 5 letters? O-U-I-J-A -> 5, but J is less common.\n\n""ABYSS"": no E.\n\nI think ""ADIEU"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut note: we are putting A at 1. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but if it is, we get a hit. If not, we know A is not at 1.\n\nSimilarly, E at 4.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""ADIEU"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid the absent letters. ""ADIEU"" has A, D, I, E, U. None of these are in the absent list (C,R,N,S,T,L). So it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, our third guess: ""ADIEU""\n\nBut let me double-check the positions:\n- A at 1: not tried before -> possible\n- D at 2: new\n- I at 3: new\n- E at 4: not tried for E at 4 (we tried E at 5 and 3, but not 4)\n- U at 5: new\n\nThis will give us information about A at 1 and E at 4, and also test D, I, U.\n\nIf A is at 1, we get a check. If not, we know it\'s not at 1. Similarly for E at 4.\n\nWe also test I and U.\n\nSo it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that puts A at 5, like ""MEDIA"", to test A at 5.\n\nBut ""ADIEU"" tests A at 1, which is a new position.\n\nI think either is fine. Let\'s go with ""ADIEU"".\n\n<guess>adieu</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L (marked ""x"" in guesses 1 and 2).\n- **Present letters**: A and E (marked ""-"" in both guesses).\n  - A cannot be at positions 3 or 4.\n  - E cannot be at positions 3 or 5.\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - A must be at position 1, 2, or 5.\n  - E must be at position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **E**.\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., D, I, U) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize positions for A and E that haven\'t been ruled out.\n\n**""ADIEU""** is chosen because:\n- Places **A** at position 1 (new, untested position) and **E** at position 4 (new, untested position).\n- Tests new vowels (I, U) and a consonant (D).\n- Uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n- Avoids all absent letters.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possible positions for A and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>adieu</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: adieu -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: x (absent)\n- A: - (present, but not at position 3)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""steal""\n- S: x (absent)\n- T: x (absent)\n- E: - (present, but not at position 3)\n- A: - (present, but not at position 4)\n- L: x (absent)\n\nGuess 3: ""adieu""\n- A: - (present, but not at position 1)\n- D: - (present, but not at position 2)\n- I: x (absent)\n- E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n- U: x (absent)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. **Correct position**: \n   - E is at position 4 (from guess 3: E is correct at position 4).\n\n2. **Present letters** (in the word, but not necessarily in the correct position):\n   - A: present, but not at position 3 (from guess 1), not at position 4 (from guess 2), and not at position 1 (from guess 3). So A cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.\n   - D: present, but not at position 2 (from guess 3). So D is in the word, but not at position 2.\n\n3. **Absent letters**: \n   - From all guesses: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.\n\n4. **Letters we know are in the word**:\n   - A (must be at 2 or 5)\n   - E (at position 4)\n   - D (present, not at 2)\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to find (since the word is 5 letters and we have 3 known: A, E, D, but one of them might be duplicated? However, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates yet).\n\nThe word structure so far: \nPosition 1: unknown (but not A, because A can\'t be at 1, and not the absent letters)\nPosition 2: could be A? or D? or another letter\nPosition 3: unknown (but not A, because A can\'t be at 3, and not absent letters)\nPosition 4: E (fixed)\nPosition 5: could be A? (since A can be at 5) or another letter.\n\nWe know A is at 2 or 5. But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, we have no indication of duplicates so far.\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Has E at position 4 (since it\'s fixed).\n- Includes A and D (since they are present, and we need to find their positions).\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.\n- Tries to test A at position 2 or 5 and D at a position that is not 2.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable positions for A: 2 or 5.\nAvailable positions for D: 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2, because D cannot be at 2).\n\nWe can try to put A at position 2 and D at position 1 or 3 or 5? But we have to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can put A at position 5 and D at position 1, 3, or 2? But D cannot be at 2, so only 1 or 3.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have E at 4, and include A and D, without the absent letters.\n\nWe also need to consider that we have two unknown letters (if A is at 2, then we have positions 1, 3, and 5 to fill; if A is at 5, then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill, and D must be in one of 1,3,5 but not 2).\n\nCase 1: A at position 2.\nThen the word: _ A _ E _\nWe need to place D in one of positions 1, 3, or 5, and the remaining two positions must be filled with new letters (not absent and not A,E,D).\n\nCase 2: A at position 5.\nThen the word: _ _ _ E A\nD must be in position 1 or 3 (since not 2, and 5 is taken by A).\n\nWe can try to test one of these cases.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, for case 1: A at 2, E at 4.\n\nWord pattern: _ A _ E _\n\nWe need to put D in one of the positions: 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBut note: if we put D at 1, then the word: D A _ E _\nIf we put D at 3: _ A D E _\nIf we put D at 5: _ A _ E D\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with new letters.\n\nAvailable letters: we have not tried: B, G, H, K, M, O, P, V, W, Y, and possibly others.\n\nLet\'s try to find valid words.\n\n- For pattern _ A D E _: \n  - The third letter must be D and fourth E? So _ A D E _\n  - Examples: ""BADED"" -> but B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And we don\'t know if D is duplicated. Also, ""BADED"" is not a common word? Actually, ""baded"" is not standard. Maybe ""bade"" is the past tense, but we need 5 letters. ""BADED"" is not a word.\n\n  - ""MADED"": M at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""madded"" is not a common word. The past tense is ""maded""? Not really. Actually, ""maded"" is not valid.\n\n  - ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""padded"" is a word. But duplicate D? We don\'t know if D is duplicated. But we can try? However, we are testing D at 3, but if D is duplicated, we might get confusing feedback.\n\n  - ""WADDY"": W at 1, A at 2, D at 3, D at 4? But E must be at 4, so not. We have E at 4.\n\n  - This pattern is hard. Let me think: ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> but T is absent (from guess2). So invalid.\n\n  - ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent, and C is out.\n\n  - ""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> T absent and E not at 4? We need E at 4.\n\n  - This pattern seems difficult. Maybe put D at 1.\n\nPattern: D A _ E _\n\nWe need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a common word. ""Damed"" might be a variant, but let\'s avoid.\n- ""DARED"": D at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.\n- ""DAVIT"": D at 1, A at 2, V at 3, I at 4 -> I absent, and E not at 4? We need E at 4.\n\nWe need E at 4, so the fourth letter must be E.\n\nSo pattern: D A _ E _\n\nWe need a letter for position 3 and 5.\n\nPossible: ""DADDY"" -> no E at 4.\n\n""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.\n\n""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.\n\n""DANDY"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3 -> N absent.\n\n""DAILY"" and ""DANCE"" are out.\n\nWhat about ""DAMED""? D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D. But we don\'t know if D is duplicated. If we use this, and if the word has only one D, we might get confusing feedback. But it\'s acceptable if we don\'t have a better option.\n\nBut ""damed"" is not a standard word. Let me think of common words.\n\n""DAVIT"": but I at 4? We need E at 4.\n\n""DAWED"": D at 1, A at 2, W at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""dawed"" is not common.\n\n""DAZED"": D at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.\n\nThis pattern is difficult without using absent letters.\n\nNow, case 2: A at 5, E at 4.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ E A\n\nD must be at position 1 or 3.\n\nIf D at 1: D _ _ E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n- ""DWEPT"": not a word.\n- ""DUPED"": D at 1, U at 2 -> U absent.\n- ""DWEEB"": not a word.\n\nIf D at 3: _ _ D E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""ABREA"": not a word.\n- ""AREA D"": no, duplicate? ""AREDE"" -> R absent.\n- ""DODEA"": not a word.\n- ""HOMED"": H at 1, O at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5? This has D at 5. We need A at 5.\n\nWe need the last letter to be A.\n\nSo: _ _ D E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""AREA"" is 4 letters.\n- ""OAKED"": O at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> but we need A at 5, not at 2. This has A at 2.\n\nWe need the word to end with ""EA"", but with E at 4 and A at 5: so the last two letters are ""EA"".\n\nSo pattern: _ _ D E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""BREAD"": B at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n- ""CREAM"": C absent.\n- ""DREAD"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n- ""FREED"": F at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n- ""WRECK"": no A.\n\nWe need the third letter to be D and the fourth E, and fifth A.\n\nSo: letter1, letter2, D, E, A.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PINED"": but no A? We need A at 5.\n\nWe need the word to end with ""DEA"".\n\nCommon words: ""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3? But we need E at 4 and A at 5. Here E is at 3 and A at 5? No, pattern is _ _ D E A, so E at 4 and A at 5.\n\nSo: ""??DEA""\n\nExamples:\n- ""ABREA"" -> not a word.\n- ""AREA"" -> too short.\n- ""AUDEA"": not a word.\n\nActually, ""DEA"" at the end: ""DEA"" is not common. We need a 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"".\n\nThere are not many English words ending with ""DEA"". The most common is ""opera"" but that\'s O-P-E-R-A, which is O(1),P(2),E(3),R(4),A(5). But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 3 and R at 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A.\n\nSo the word must end with ""EA"", but that would be positions 4 and 5: E at 4, A at 5. But in ""opera"", E is at 3 and A at 5? No: positions:\nPosition 1: O\nPosition 2: P\nPosition 3: E\nPosition 4: R\nPosition 5: A\n\nSo it\'s O-P-E-R-A, which is not _ _ D E A.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be A. So the last two letters must be ""EA"", but that would be: position 4 = E, position 5 = A. So the word ends with ""EA"".\n\nBut in the pattern _ _ D E A, the fourth letter is E and fifth is A, so the last two are E and then A? No: the pattern is: position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: D, 4: E, 5: A.\n\nSo the word ends with ""DEA"", not ""EA"". ""DEA"" means decommission, but it\'s 3 letters? 5-letter words ending with ""DEA"" are rare.\n\nCommon words: ""opera"" ends with ""A"", not ""DEA"".\n\nActually, I can\'t think of any common 5-letter word ending with ""DEA"". The only one I can think of is ""opera"", but that has E at position 3, not 4.\n\nWe need E at position 4 and A at position 5: so the word must be ...E A, meaning position 4 is E and position 5 is A.\n\nBut ""DEA"" is not a common ending. For example, ""MEDIA"" is M-E-D-I-A, which is positions: M(1), E(2), D(3), I(4), A(5). So E at 2, D at 3, I at 4, A at 5. But we need E at 4 and A at 5? Here E is at 2 and D at 3.\n\nWe need E at 4 and A at 5: so the word must have the fourth letter E and fifth A.\n\nBut ""DEA"" is not a standard ending. Perhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.\n\nI think I have a mistake: the pattern for A at 5 and E at 4: the word should be ? ? ? E A.\n\nFor example, ""PIZZA"" is P-I-Z-Z-A, no E.\n\n""JUMBA"" no E.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe we should consider that A might be at 2.\n\nBack to case 1: A at 2, E at 4.\n\nPattern: _ A _ E _\n\nWe need to place D in 1,3, or 5.\n\nBut if we put D at 1: D A _ E _\n\nWe need a letter for position 3 and 5, and avoid absent letters.\n\nPosition 3: must be a letter, and position 5: must be a letter.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DAMED"": D at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""damed"" is not a standard word. ""Damned"" is 6 letters.\n- ""DADDY"": no E at 4.\n- ""DAILY"": D at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4 -> L absent and I absent.\n- ""DANCE"": D at 1, A at 2, N at 3, C at 4 -> N and C absent.\n- ""DAPER"": D at 1, A at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> R absent.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words without the absent letters.\n\nWhat about ""BAKED"": but we have B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5? But we have D at 5. And ""BAKED"" is B-A-K-E-D. So positions: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters? B, K, D are not absent? We haven\'t tried B or K. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut in this word, we are putting A at 2 (which is allowed) and D at 5. We also test B and K.\n\nBut we have E at 4, which is fixed.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" is a candidate: B(1), A(2), K(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nBut we have to check if D can be at 5. Yes, because we haven\'t tried D at 5.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""MAKED"": not a word.\n\n""PAVED"": P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). Also a candidate.\n\n""HAVED"": H(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.\n\n""WADED"": W(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5) -> duplicate D, and D at 3 and 5? But we are putting D at 3 and 5? But we don\'t know if D is duplicated. Also, ""waDED"" has two D\'s.\n\nBut we can try, but it might be messy.\n\n""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" are better.\n\nBut we also have the option to put D at position 3.\n\nFor example, pattern: _ A D E _\n\nWe need a letter for position 1 and 5.\n\nExamples:\n- ""BADGE"": B at 1, A at 2, D at 3, G at 4? But we need E at 4, not G. So no.\n- ""BADE"": too short.\n- ""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D, and ""haded"" is not common.\n- ""MADED"": not a word.\n- ""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.\n\nIt seems difficult to find a word with E at 4 and D at 3 without using absent letters.\n\nWhat about ""BAKED"" and ""PAVED"" we have.\n\nBut we also have the possibility of A at 5.\n\nIf A at 5, then pattern: _ _ _ E A\n\nAnd D must be at 1 or 3.\n\nIf D at 1: D _ _ E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""DREAM"": D at 1, R at 2 -> R absent.\n- ""DUEA"": not 5 letters.\n- ""DECEA"": not a word.\n\nIf D at 3: _ _ D E A\n\nExamples:\n- ""OPREA"": not a word.\n- ""AREA"": too short.\n- ""UREDA"": U at 1, R at 2 -> U and R absent.\n- ""ENDEA"": not a word.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence.\n\nAnother idea: we know E is at 4, and A is at 2 or 5.\n\nWe can try a word that tests A at 2 and also tests other possibilities.\n\nBut we have to include D.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit the constraints.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 4: E\n- A must be at 2 or 5.\n- D is present, not at 2, so at 1,3,5.\n\nBut if A is at 5, then D cannot be at 5 (same position), so D must be at 1 or 3.\n\nIf A is at 2, then D can be at 1,3,5.\n\nBut we need to find a word that exists.\n\nPerhaps ""BAKED"" is a good choice: it tests A at 2 and D at 5, and we test B and K.\n\nSimilarly, ""PAVED"" tests P and V.\n\nBut we also have the option to test A at 5.\n\nFor example, ""MEDIA"": M at 1, E at 2? But we need E at 4, not at 2. In ""MEDIA"", E is at 2, not 4.\n\nWe need E at 4.\n\nSo for A at 5 and E at 4: we need a word ending with ""EA"", but as we saw, there are few.\n\n""DEA"" is not common. The only one I know is ""opera"", but that doesn\'t fit.\n\nPerhaps ""DEBAR"" is D-E-B-A-R, which is not ending with EA.\n\nI think we have to consider that A might be at 2.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BAKED"": B at 1, A at 2, K at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\nThis tests:\n- A at 2: if it\'s correct, we get a hit; if not, then A must be at 5.\n- D at 5: if it\'s correct, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.\n- We test B and K.\n\nIf we get feedback that A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and D must be at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, if D is not at 5, then D is at 1 or 3.\n\nBut we also test B and K.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5.\n\nThis tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BAKED"" uses B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are known to be present, and B, K are new).\n\nSimilarly, ""PAVED"" uses P, A, V, E, D.\n\nBoth are valid words.\n\nWe can also consider ""HATED"": but T is absent.\n\n""MADED"": not a word.\n\n""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D. So positions: W(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5). This avoids absent letters.\n\nSo ""WAVED"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""BAKED"", ""PAVED"", ""WAVED"".\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nWe want to test new letters. We have not tried: B, K, P, V, W, M, etc.\n\n""BAKED"" tests B and K.\n""PAVED"" tests P and V.\n""WAVED"" tests W and V.\n\nWe can choose ""WAVED"" because W is a common letter? Or ""BAKED"" because K is common.\n\nBut we also have to consider that if A is not at 2, then we know A is at 5, and we can adjust.\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess, and we have two known letters (A and D) to place, and we need to find the other two.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has A at 5 and D at 1 or 3, but we need a valid word.\n\nFor example, ""DOZEN"": but N absent and E at 4? ""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N, so E at 4? Actually: D(1), O(2), Z(3), E(4), N(5). But N is absent and A is missing.\n\nWe need A at 5.\n\n""DEBAR"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, A at 4? But A cannot be at 4 (from guess2). And E at 2? We need E at 4.\n\nNot matching.\n\n""DOULA"": no E at 4.\n\nI think we have to go with one of the ""BAKED"" type words.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with A at 5 and E at 4.\n\nFor example, ""PIZZA"" is not ending with EA.\n\n""JUMBA"" no E.\n\n""KARMA"": K at 1, A at 2, R at 3 -> R absent.\n\n""DELTA"": D at 1, E at 2, L at 3 -> L absent and E at 2 not 4.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps ""DEUCE"": but C absent and E at 2.\n\nI think we have to accept that A is at 2 for now, and test that.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""BAKED"".\n\nBut in ""BAKED"", we are putting A at 2 and D at 5.\n\nIf A is at 2, then we get a hit for A. If not, then A must be at 5.\n\nSimilarly, for D: we are putting D at 5. If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, we test B and K.\n\nSo ""BAKED"" is a good test.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAVED"", which tests A at 2 and D at 5, and P and V.\n\nBut ""BAKED"" is more common.\n\nAnother word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.\n\n""BAKED"" seems fine.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BAKED"" is valid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BAKED"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5.\n\nFor example, ""MEDIA"" has E at 2, not 4.\n\n""OCEAN"": O at 1, C at 2 -> C absent.\n\n""OPERA"": O at 1, P at 2, E at 3 -> E at 3 is not 4.\n\nI think we have to stick with A at 2.\n\nSo guess: ""BAKED""\n\nBut in ""BAKED"", we have E at 4, which is correct, and A at 2, D at 5.\n\nWe also test B and K.\n\nIf the feedback shows:\n- If A is at 2, we get a hit. If not, we know A is at 5.\n- If D is at 5, we get a hit; if not, then D is at 1 or 3.\n\nAnd we test B and K.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar.\n\nBut ""BAKED"" is more common.\n\nAnother common word: ""BALED"" but L absent.\n\n""BAKED"" is okay.\n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters. In ""BAKED"", we have B, A, K, E, D. All are allowed (A and D are present, B, K not tried).\n\nSo let\'s go with ""BAKED"".\n\nBut wait, in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a new position.\n\nWe can also consider ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D.\n\nBut ""BAKED"" is fine.\n\nI think ""BAKED"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests A at 5 without using absent letters.\n\nFor example, ""DEWAR"": not a word.\n\n""DEBUT"": D at 1, E at 2, B at 3, U at 4 -> U absent and E at 2 not 4.\n\nNo.\n\n""DEIGN"": D at 1, E at 2, I at 3, G at 4, N at 5 -> N absent and I absent.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""BAKED"" is a solid choice.\n\nTherefore, our fourth guess: ""BAKED""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we expect if A is at 2 and D at 5, but we don\'t know if that\'s the case.\n\nWe are testing the hypothesis.\n\nIf the word is ""BAKED"", we might get lucky.\n\nBut if not, we get information.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAVED"", which is similar but with P and V instead of B and K.\n\nBut B and K are as common as P and V? Actually, K is more common than V.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nI think ""BAKED"" is better.\n\nAnother word: ""MAVED"" is not common. ""MAKER"" has R.\n\n""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.\n\n""BAKED"" is standard.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BAKED"".\n\nBut we have to output in the format.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test A at 5.\n\nBut I can\'t find a common word with E at 4 and A at 5.\n\nSo let\'s stick with ""BAKED"".\n\nBut in ""BAKED"", we are putting D at 5. We know E is at 4, so D at 5 is a position we are testing.\n\nIf D is at 5, we get a hit. If not, we know D is at 1 or 3.\n\nSimilarly, for A: we are putting at 2, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nSo it\'s good.\n\nWe can also consider ""DAVIT"", but I at 3? And we need E at 4, not I.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think ""BAKED"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word like ""DEWAR"" but it\'s not English.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nSo the guess is ""BAKED"".\n\nBut wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have E at 4 correct? Actually, in ""adieu"", E was at 4 and we got a check, so E is at 4.\n\nSo in ""BAKED"", E at 4 is correct, so we expect that.\n\nA at 2: we are testing if it\'s correct.\n\nD at 5: testing if it\'s correct.\n\nB and K: new letters.\n\nSo let\'s do it.\n\n<guess>baked</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 3: E(✓)).\n- **A is present** but cannot be at positions 1, 3, or 4 (from Guesses 1, 2, and 3). Therefore, A must be at position 2 or 5.\n- **D is present** but not at position 2 (from Guess 3: D(-)).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).\n- **Unknown positions**: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with A and D needing to be placed).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **D**.\n- **E must be at position 4**.\n- Avoid all absent letters.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, K) to gather more information.\n- Prioritize resolving the positions of A and D.\n\n**""BAKED""** is chosen because:\n- Places **A** at position 2 (testing if A is at position 2).\n- Places **D** at position 5 (testing if D is at position 5).\n- Keeps **E** at position 4 (confirmed correct).\n- Tests new letters **B** and **K** (common consonants).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down the possible positions for A and D while testing two new letters.\n\n<guess>baked</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) A(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: adieu -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(-) I(x) E(✓) U(x)\nGuess 4: baked -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) K(x) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 3)
- A: - (present, but not at position 4)
- L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""adieu""
- A: - (present, but not at position 1)
- D: - (present, but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- U: x (absent)

Guess 4: ""baked""
- B: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- K: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- D: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions**:
   - Position 2: A (from guess 4: A(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from guess 3: E(✓))
   - Position 5: D (from guess 4: D(✓))

2. **Absent letters**: 
   - From all guesses: B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.

3. **Present letters**:
   - A, E, D are confirmed in the word and in the positions we now know: A at 2, E at 4, D at 5.
   - We also know from previous guesses that A and E were present but not in the positions we tried (A not at 1,3,4; E not at 3,5).

4. **Remaining unknown**: 
   - Position 1: We don't know the letter at position 1. It cannot be any of the absent letters.
   - We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at 2, E at 4, D at 5, so position 1 and 3 are unknown.

5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 3: We don't know what is at position 3, but it cannot be any absent letter and must not be A, E, or D (since they are fixed at 2,4,5). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far. We should not rule out duplicates, but based on feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks. So we assume no duplicates for now.

Given the known positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D
- Position 1: unknown (must be a letter not in {B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U})
- Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 1, and must not be A, E, D)

We need to form a word that has:
- Position 1: a letter not in the absent list
- Position 3: a letter not in the absent list and not A, E, D
- And the word must be valid.

We also know that the letter at position 1 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet: F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters.

We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3.

We can try to guess a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible words:

- ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent (from guess2). Not allowed.
- ""FADED"": F at 1, A at 2, D at 3 -> but D is at 3? But we have D at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know. Also, ""faded"" has two D's. And T not present? T is absent, so ""FADED"" has T at 3? T is absent, so invalid.

We need to avoid absent letters.

Let's think of words that start with a letter and have A at 2, E at 4, D at 5, and a letter at 3.

For example:
- ""HAZED"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> Z is not absent? We haven't tried Z. So it's possible. ""Hazed"" is a word: H-A-Z-E-D.
- ""JAMED"": J at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""jamed"" is not a common word? I think ""jamed"" is not standard. ""Jamed"" might be a variant, but let's avoid.
- ""WAMED"": W at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""wamed"" is not common.
- ""YAMED"": Y at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""yamed"" is not a word.
- ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent.
- ""BAKED"": we tried, but B and K are absent.
- ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""paved"" is a word: P-A-V-E-D. This is similar to ""baked"" but with P and V instead of B and K.

""PAVED"" has V at 3. We haven't tried V.

Similarly, ""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""PAVED"" is a valid word.

Other options: ""NAVED"": N absent.

""MAVED"": M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""maved"" is not a word.

""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D.

So ""WAVED"" is a possibility.

But ""PAVED"" and ""WAVED"" are both options.

We can also consider ""FADED"": but T is absent.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""jaded"" is a word: J-A-D-E-D. But we have D at 3 and 5? But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. Also, in ""jaded"", the first D is at 5 and third at 3. But we don't know if D is duplicated. However, we are testing.

But ""jaded"" has two D's, which might not be ideal for information.

Similarly, ""BADED"" is not a word.

""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

""LADED"": L absent.

""MADED"": not a word.

""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

So without duplicates, we have ""PAVED"" (P, A, V, E, D) and ""WAVED"" (W, A, V, E, D).

""PAVED"" is more common? Actually, ""paved"" is a word.

We can also consider ""FACED"", but C absent.

""RACED"": R absent.

""VOTED"": no A.

I think ""PAVED"" is a good choice.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""HATED"" is invalid because of T.

""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3 -> B absent and no E at 4.

We need E at 4.

So ""PAVED"" seems good.

But let me see if there is a word with a different letter at 3 to test more letters.

For example, ""WAVED"" has V at 3.

We haven't tried V.

Similarly, P in ""PAVED"".

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider that we are on the fifth guess. We have two unknowns: position 1 and 3.

We can try ""PAVED"" to test P and V.

But if we try ""PAVED"", we are testing:
- P at 1: if present and correct?
- V at 3: if present and correct?
- And we know A, E, D are fixed.

If we get feedback that P is absent or wrong, we know less.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 3.

We can also try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at position 1 and a common letter at 3.

For example, ""WAVED"" tests W at 1 and V at 3.

But V at 3 might be less common.

Perhaps ""HATED"" is invalid.

Another word: ""MAUVE"": M at 1, A at 2, U at 3 -> U absent and no E at 4.

No.

""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""gazed"" is a word: G-A-Z-E-D. This uses G and Z.

Z is less common, but it's a word.

Similarly, ""FACED"" is invalid.

""JAZED"": not a word.

""VAGED"": not common.

I think ""PAVED"" is a solid choice.

But let me check the feedback from guess 4: we have A at 2 correct, E at 4 correct, D at 5 correct. So the word ends with ""AED"", but specifically: position 2: A, 4: E, 5: D, so the last three letters are AED.

But position 1 is before that.

So the word is ? A ? E D

We need a letter at position 1 and 3.

Common words: ""PAVED"" is one.

""WAVED"" is another.

""HAVED"" not a word.

""LAVED"" not a word.

""MAVED"" not a word.

""RAVED"": R absent.

""SAVED"": S absent.

""VAVED"": not a word.

""WAVED"": not a word.

""YALED"": Y at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HALED"": H at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3 -> but D at 3? But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. Also, ""jaDED"" has two D's.

""JADED"" is a word: J-A-D-E-D. So positions: J(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But D is at 3 and 5. We know D is at 5, so if the word has two D's, that's possible. But we don't have evidence. However, we can try.

But we are testing position 3 with D, which we know is not possible? Because D is at 5, and if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. But we are not sure.

To avoid confusion, we can try a word without duplicate D.

So ""PAVED"" is better: no duplicate.

Similarly, ""WAVED"" has no duplicate.

""PAVED"" is P-A-V-E-D.

Position 1: P
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: V
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: D (fixed)

This tests:
- P at position 1: if it's correct, we get a hit; if absent, we know P is not in the word.
- V at position 3: if correct, hit; if absent, then V is not in the word.

If P is absent, then we know position 1 is not P, and we can try other letters.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test two new letters.

We can also try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at position 1 and a common letter at 3.

For example, ""WAVED"" tests W at 1 and V at 3.

But V at 3 is less common.

""HAZED"" is not standard.

""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""gazed"" is a word. G(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), D(5). This tests G and Z.

Z is uncommon, so it might not be efficient.

Similarly, ""FACED"" is invalid.

I think ""PAVED"" is better.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not a word.

""BEVED"": B absent.

""DEVED"": D at 1, E at 2 -> but E at 2 is not 4? We need E at 4.

No.

So I think ""PAVED"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the absent letters: we have to avoid B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.

P, V, and D are present, but D is at 5, so for position 1, we can use P.

V is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""HATED"", but T is absent.

""PAVED"" is the best so far.

But we have another option: ""WAVED"".

Let me decide: I'll go with ""PAVED"".

But in ""PAVED"", we are testing P at 1 and V at 3.

If we get feedback that P is absent, then we know position 1 is not P, and we can try other letters.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are on guess 5, and we have one more after if needed).

But we might solve it.

Another word: ""JAVED"": not a word.

""VADED"": duplicate D? ""VADED"" is V-A-D-E-D, so D at 3 and 5. But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be duplicate. And ""vaded"" is not common.

""WADED"": W-A-D-E-D, duplicate D.

I think ""PAVED"" is standard.

So I'll go with ""PAVED"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be at position 1 and 3.

For example, ""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Gazed"" is a word.

But Z is uncommon.

""FADED"": F at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

So duplicates are common in words ending with ""AED"".

But we can avoid by not putting D at 3 if we are testing position 1.

In ""PAVED"", we don't put D at 3, we put V at 3.

Similarly, in ""WAVED"", we put V at 3.

But we can also try a word that has a different letter at 3, like ""HATED"" but T absent.

""MAVED"" not a word.

""PAVED"" is the best.

But we have ""WAVED"", which is also valid.

I think I'll go with ""PAVED"" because P is more common than W.

So guess: ""PAVED""

But let me write it.

<guess>paved</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have:

- **Position 2**: A (confirmed correct in Guess 4)
- **Position 4**: E (confirmed correct in Guess 3)
- **Position 5**: D (confirmed correct in Guess 4)
- **Position 1**: Unknown, but must be a letter not in the absent list (B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U).
- **Position 3**: Unknown, but must be a letter not in the absent list and not A, E, or D (since these are fixed in other positions, and no duplicates have been indicated in feedback).

The secret word pattern is: `? A ? E D`

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not in the absent list and not A, E, or D.

Possible letters for position 1 and 3: F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits `? A ? E D`.

After evaluating options:
- **""PAVED""** (P at 1, V at 3) is a valid word and tests two new common letters (P and V). 
- **""WAVED""** (W at 1, V at 3) is also valid but tests W instead of P.
- **""GAZED""** (G at 1, Z at 3) is valid but uses less common letters.

""PAVED"" is chosen because:
- Tests **P** at position 1 (new letter) and **V** at position 3 (new letter).
- Uses distinct letters to maximize information if incorrect.
- Avoids all absent letters.

If ""PAVED"" is incorrect, the feedback will help identify the missing letter at position 1 and 3.

<guess>paved</guess>",paved,"We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present, but not at position 3)
- N: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""steal""
- S: x (absent)
- T: x (absent)
- E: - (present, but not at position 3)
- A: - (present, but not at position 4)
- L: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""adieu""
- A: - (present, but not at position 1)
- D: - (present, but not at position 2)
- I: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- U: x (absent)

Guess 4: ""baked""
- B: x (absent)
- A: ✓ (correct at position 2)
- K: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
- D: ✓ (correct at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. **Correct positions**:
   - Position 2: A (from guess 4: A(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from guess 3: E(✓))
   - Position 5: D (from guess 4: D(✓))

2. **Absent letters**: 
   - From all guesses: B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U are absent. So we must avoid these.

3. **Present letters**:
   - A, E, D are confirmed in the word and in the positions we now know: A at 2, E at 4, D at 5.
   - We also know from previous guesses that A and E were present but not in the positions we tried (A not at 1,3,4; E not at 3,5).

4. **Remaining unknown**: 
   - Position 1: We don't know the letter at position 1. It cannot be any of the absent letters.
   - We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, and we have A at 2, E at 4, D at 5, so position 1 and 3 are unknown.

5. **Constraints**:
   - Position 3: We don't know what is at position 3, but it cannot be any absent letter and must not be A, E, or D (since they are fixed at 2,4,5). But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far. We should not rule out duplicates, but based on feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate marks. So we assume no duplicates for now.

Given the known positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: D
- Position 1: unknown (must be a letter not in {B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U})
- Position 3: unknown (same constraints as position 1, and must not be A, E, D)

We need to form a word that has:
- Position 1: a letter not in the absent list
- Position 3: a letter not in the absent list and not A, E, D
- And the word must be valid.

We also know that the letter at position 1 and 3 must be from the remaining alphabet: F, G, H, J, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we should focus on common letters.

We have two positions to fill: 1 and 3.

We can try to guess a word that uses common letters for position 1 and 3.

Possible words:

- ""HATED"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3 -> T is absent (from guess2). Not allowed.
- ""FADED"": F at 1, A at 2, D at 3 -> but D is at 3? But we have D at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate? But we don't know. Also, ""faded"" has two D's. And T not present? T is absent, so ""FADED"" has T at 3? T is absent, so invalid.

We need to avoid absent letters.

Let's think of words that start with a letter and have A at 2, E at 4, D at 5, and a letter at 3.

For example:
- ""HAZED"": H at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> Z is not absent? We haven't tried Z. So it's possible. ""Hazed"" is a word: H-A-Z-E-D.
- ""JAMED"": J at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""jamed"" is not a common word? I think ""jamed"" is not standard. ""Jamed"" might be a variant, but let's avoid.
- ""WAMED"": W at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""wamed"" is not common.
- ""YAMED"": Y at 1, A at 2, M at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""yamed"" is not a word.
- ""FACED"": F at 1, A at 2, C at 3 -> C absent.
- ""BAKED"": we tried, but B and K are absent.
- ""PAVED"": P at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""paved"" is a word: P-A-V-E-D. This is similar to ""baked"" but with P and V instead of B and K.

""PAVED"" has V at 3. We haven't tried V.

Similarly, ""HAVED"": H at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""haved"" is not a common word; ""havoc"" is different.

""PAVED"" is a valid word.

Other options: ""NAVED"": N absent.

""MAVED"": M at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""maved"" is not a word.

""WAVED"": W at 1, A at 2, V at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""waved"" is a word: W-A-V-E-D.

So ""WAVED"" is a possibility.

But ""PAVED"" and ""WAVED"" are both options.

We can also consider ""FADED"": but T is absent.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D? And ""jaded"" is a word: J-A-D-E-D. But we have D at 3 and 5? But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. Also, in ""jaded"", the first D is at 5 and third at 3. But we don't know if D is duplicated. However, we are testing.

But ""jaded"" has two D's, which might not be ideal for information.

Similarly, ""BADED"" is not a word.

""HADED"": H at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

""LADED"": L absent.

""MADED"": not a word.

""PADED"": P at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

So without duplicates, we have ""PAVED"" (P, A, V, E, D) and ""WAVED"" (W, A, V, E, D).

""PAVED"" is more common? Actually, ""paved"" is a word.

We can also consider ""FACED"", but C absent.

""RACED"": R absent.

""VOTED"": no A.

I think ""PAVED"" is a good choice.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""HATED"" is invalid because of T.

""JABOT"": J at 1, A at 2, B at 3 -> B absent and no E at 4.

We need E at 4.

So ""PAVED"" seems good.

But let me see if there is a word with a different letter at 3 to test more letters.

For example, ""WAVED"" has V at 3.

We haven't tried V.

Similarly, P in ""PAVED"".

We can choose one.

But we also have to consider that we are on the fifth guess. We have two unknowns: position 1 and 3.

We can try ""PAVED"" to test P and V.

But if we try ""PAVED"", we are testing:
- P at 1: if present and correct?
- V at 3: if present and correct?
- And we know A, E, D are fixed.

If we get feedback that P is absent or wrong, we know less.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two positions to guess: position 1 and 3.

We can also try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at position 1 and a common letter at 3.

For example, ""WAVED"" tests W at 1 and V at 3.

But V at 3 might be less common.

Perhaps ""HATED"" is invalid.

Another word: ""MAUVE"": M at 1, A at 2, U at 3 -> U absent and no E at 4.

No.

""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""gazed"" is a word: G-A-Z-E-D. This uses G and Z.

Z is less common, but it's a word.

Similarly, ""FACED"" is invalid.

""JAZED"": not a word.

""VAGED"": not common.

I think ""PAVED"" is a solid choice.

But let me check the feedback from guess 4: we have A at 2 correct, E at 4 correct, D at 5 correct. So the word ends with ""AED"", but specifically: position 2: A, 4: E, 5: D, so the last three letters are AED.

But position 1 is before that.

So the word is ? A ? E D

We need a letter at position 1 and 3.

Common words: ""PAVED"" is one.

""WAVED"" is another.

""HAVED"" not a word.

""LAVED"" not a word.

""MAVED"" not a word.

""RAVED"": R absent.

""SAVED"": S absent.

""VAVED"": not a word.

""WAVED"": not a word.

""YALED"": Y at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""HALED"": H at 1, A at 2, L at 3 -> L absent.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3 -> but D at 3? But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. Also, ""jaDED"" has two D's.

""JADED"" is a word: J-A-D-E-D. So positions: J(1), A(2), D(3), E(4), D(5). But D is at 3 and 5. We know D is at 5, so if the word has two D's, that's possible. But we don't have evidence. However, we can try.

But we are testing position 3 with D, which we know is not possible? Because D is at 5, and if we put D at 3, it might be a duplicate. But we are not sure.

To avoid confusion, we can try a word without duplicate D.

So ""PAVED"" is better: no duplicate.

Similarly, ""WAVED"" has no duplicate.

""PAVED"" is P-A-V-E-D.

Position 1: P
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: V
Position 4: E (fixed)
Position 5: D (fixed)

This tests:
- P at position 1: if it's correct, we get a hit; if absent, we know P is not in the word.
- V at position 3: if correct, hit; if absent, then V is not in the word.

If P is absent, then we know position 1 is not P, and we can try other letters.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two positions to guess, so we can test two new letters.

We can also try a word that uses a letter we haven't tried at position 1 and a common letter at 3.

For example, ""WAVED"" tests W at 1 and V at 3.

But V at 3 is less common.

""HAZED"" is not standard.

""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> ""gazed"" is a word. G(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), D(5). This tests G and Z.

Z is uncommon, so it might not be efficient.

Similarly, ""FACED"" is invalid.

I think ""PAVED"" is better.

Another word: ""MAVED"" is not a word.

""BEVED"": B absent.

""DEVED"": D at 1, E at 2 -> but E at 2 is not 4? We need E at 4.

No.

So I think ""PAVED"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm the absent letters: we have to avoid B, C, R, N, S, T, L, I, U.

P, V, and D are present, but D is at 5, so for position 1, we can use P.

V is a less common letter, but it's acceptable.

We can also consider ""HATED"", but T is absent.

""PAVED"" is the best so far.

But we have another option: ""WAVED"".

Let me decide: I'll go with ""PAVED"".

But in ""PAVED"", we are testing P at 1 and V at 3.

If we get feedback that P is absent, then we know position 1 is not P, and we can try other letters.

Similarly for V.

But we have only two guesses left (since we are on guess 5, and we have 6 tries, so two more after this? No, we are on guess 5, and we have one more after if needed).

But we might solve it.

Another word: ""JAVED"": not a word.

""VADED"": duplicate D? ""VADED"" is V-A-D-E-D, so D at 3 and 5. But we know D is at 5, so if we put D at 3, it might be duplicate. And ""vaded"" is not common.

""WADED"": W-A-D-E-D, duplicate D.

I think ""PAVED"" is standard.

So I'll go with ""PAVED"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter that might be at position 1 and 3.

For example, ""GAZED"": G at 1, A at 2, Z at 3, E at 4, D at 5. ""Gazed"" is a word.

But Z is uncommon.

""FADED"": F at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

""JADED"": J at 1, A at 2, D at 3, E at 4, D at 5 -> duplicate D.

So duplicates are common in words ending with ""AED"".

But we can avoid by not putting D at 3 if we are testing position 1.

In ""PAVED"", we don't put D at 3, we put V at 3.

Similarly, in ""WAVED"", we put V at 3.

But we can also try a word that has a different letter at 3, like ""HATED"" but T absent.

""MAVED"" not a word.

""PAVED"" is the best.

But we have ""WAVED"", which is also valid.

I think I'll go with ""PAVED"" because P is more common than W.

So guess: ""PAVED""

But let me write it.

<guess>paved</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have:

The secret word pattern is: `? A ? E D`
