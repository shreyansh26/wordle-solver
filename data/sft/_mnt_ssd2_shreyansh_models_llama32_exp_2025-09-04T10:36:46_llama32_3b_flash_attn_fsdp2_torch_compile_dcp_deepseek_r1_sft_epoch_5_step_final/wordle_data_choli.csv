We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word has the letter 'C' in the first position. The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with 'C' and does not contain R, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is C)
- Does not contain R, A, N, E (since they are not in the word)
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the letter 'C' in the first position and then uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- We know the word must start with C and not have R, A, N, E.

Let's think of 5-letter words starting with C that avoid R, A, N, E.

Some options:
- ""CLOUD"": uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don't know if these are in the word.
- ""CHILL"": has double L, which might not be efficient for getting information.
- ""CIVIC"": has repeated C and I, but we already know the first letter is C, so we don't need to test C again? Actually, we know the first letter is C, but the word might have another C? However, we don't have information about other positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""crane"". Since the first letter is C and it's correct, we know that the word starts with C. The other letters (R, A, N, E) are absent.

So, for the second guess, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:

- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""COULD"": C, O, U, L, D -> same as above but with different order?
- ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P
- ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B
- ""COAST"": but has A (which is excluded) -> not allowed because A is not in the word.
- ""CROSS"": has R (excluded) and S, S -> but R is excluded.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Another idea: ""CLOUD"" is a valid word and uses C, L, O, U, D. All these letters are new.

But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another common starting word is ""SLATE"", but it starts with S, not C. We know the first letter is C, so we can't use that.

We can try ""CHILL"", but it has two L's. It might be less informative.

Alternatively, ""CIVIC"" has two C's and I's. But we know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. However, we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

But let's think about the feedback: we have only one letter fixed (C in position 1). We need to test other positions.

Another word: ""COMET"" -> but has E (excluded) and M, O, T.

E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N.

So, let's avoid E and use other vowels? The word must have vowels? The known letters are C (which is a consonant) and we don't know about others. But we know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now).

We can try ""CLOUD"" or ""CHIMP"" or ""CLIMB"".

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we get to test L, O, U, D.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses letters that are common and distinct to maximize information.

Another idea: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D. This is similar to ""CLOUD"" but rearranged.

But ""CLOUD"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""CUSHION"", but that has 6 letters? No, 5 letters: C-U-S-H-I-O? 5 letters: C, U, S, H, I? But we need 5 letters.

Let me check: ""CUSHION"" is 6 letters. So not.

Another 5-letter word: ""CIVIC"" -> but has two C's and two I's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. Also, we are testing I.

But we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""CIVIC"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

However, using two C's might not be efficient because if we get a feedback for the second C, we might not know if it's in the word or not? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is present. But if we use two C's, then we are testing the same letter in two positions. If the word has only one C, then one of the C's will be marked as absent? But the feedback marks each letter individually.

Let me clarify the rules: for each letter, we get a symbol: 
  - ✓: correct letter and position
  - -: letter in word but wrong position
  - x: letter not in word.

So if we use two C's, and the word has only one C (in the first position), then the first C will be ✓ and the second C will be x (because the word only has one C and it's already used in the first position). But if the word has two C's, then both might be marked appropriately.

However, we don't know if the word has more than one C. So it might be inefficient.

Therefore, it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

Back to ""CLOUD"": C (fixed), L, O, U, D -> all distinct and new.

Similarly, ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P -> distinct and new.

We can also consider ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B -> distinct.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> distinct.

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""CLOUD"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (the one in the first position is a consonant, but we don't know about others). Actually, we don't have information about vowels because we only tested A and E and they were absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or Y.

So, including a vowel (O or U) is good.

""CLOUD"" has O and U.

So, I'll go with ""CLOUD"".

But wait: what about the position of the known letter? We are keeping C in the first position, which is correct.

So, our second guess: ""CLOUD""

We'll get feedback on L, O, U, D.

If we get a ✓ for any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but not in that position. If x, then not in the word.

This will help us narrow down.

So, the guess is ""cloud"".

But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""cloud"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, I choose ""cloud"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"".
- The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.
- We need to avoid these letters in our next guess.

For the second guess, we should:
- Keep ""C"" in the first position (since it's confirmed correct).
- Use other common letters that haven't been tested yet (e.g., L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, S, T).
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid R, A, N, E.

The word ""cloud"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"" (first position fixed).
- Uses new common letters: L, O, U, D.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids R, A, N, E.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters are in the word and their positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

- ""CIVIC"": has repeated C and I, but we already know the first letter is C, so we don't need to test C again? Actually, we know the first letter is C, but the word might have another C? However, we don't have information about other positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""crane"". Since the first letter is C and it's correct, we know that the word starts with C. The other letters (R, A, N, E) are absent.

So, for the second guess, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:

- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""COULD"": C, O, U, L, D -> same as above but with different order?
- ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P
- ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B
- ""COAST"": but has A (which is excluded) -> not allowed because A is not in the word.
- ""CROSS"": has R (excluded) and S, S -> but R is excluded.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Another idea: ""CLOUD"" is a valid word and uses C, L, O, U, D. All these letters are new.

But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another common starting word is ""SLATE"", but it starts with S, not C. We know the first letter is C, so we can't use that.

We can try ""CHILL"", but it has two L's. It might be less informative.

Alternatively, ""CIVIC"" has two C's and I's. But we know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. However, we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

But let's think about the feedback: we have only one letter fixed (C in position 1). We need to test other positions.

Another word: ""COMET"" -> but has E (excluded) and M, O, T.

E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N.

So, let's avoid E and use other vowels? The word must have vowels? The known letters are C (which is a consonant) and we don't know about others. But we know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now).

We can try ""CLOUD"" or ""CHIMP"" or ""CLIMB"".

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we get to test L, O, U, D.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses letters that are common and distinct to maximize information.

Another idea: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D. This is similar to ""CLOUD"" but rearranged.

But ""CLOUD"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""CUSHION"", but that has 6 letters? No, 5 letters: C-U-S-H-I-O? 5 letters: C, U, S, H, I? But we need 5 letters.

Let me check: ""CUSHION"" is 6 letters. So not.

Another 5-letter word: ""CIVIC"" -> but has two C's and two I's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. Also, we are testing I.

But we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""CIVIC"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

However, using two C's might not be efficient because if we get a feedback for the second C, we might not know if it's in the word or not? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is present. But if we use two C's, then we are testing the same letter in two positions. If the word has only one C, then one of the C's will be marked as absent? But the feedback marks each letter individually.

Let me clarify the rules: for each letter, we get a symbol: 
  - ✓: correct letter and position
  - -: letter in word but wrong position
  - x: letter not in word.

So if we use two C's, and the word has only one C (in the first position), then the first C will be ✓ and the second C will be x (because the word only has one C and it's already used in the first position). But if the word has two C's, then both might be marked appropriately.

However, we don't know if the word has more than one C. So it might be inefficient.

Therefore, it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

Back to ""CLOUD"": C (fixed), L, O, U, D -> all distinct and new.

Similarly, ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P -> distinct and new.

We can also consider ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B -> distinct.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> distinct.

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""CLOUD"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (the one in the first position is a consonant, but we don't know about others). Actually, we don't have information about vowels because we only tested A and E and they were absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or Y.

So, including a vowel (O or U) is good.

""CLOUD"" has O and U.

So, I'll go with ""CLOUD"".

But wait: what about the position of the known letter? We are keeping C in the first position, which is correct.

So, our second guess: ""CLOUD""

We'll get feedback on L, O, U, D.

If we get a ✓ for any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but not in that position. If x, then not in the word.

This will help us narrow down.

So, the guess is ""cloud"".

But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""cloud"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, I choose ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"".
- The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.
- We need to avoid these letters in our next guess.

For the second guess, we should:
- Keep ""C"" in the first position (since it's confirmed correct).
- Use other common letters that haven't been tested yet (e.g., L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, S, T).
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid R, A, N, E.

The word ""cloud"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"" (first position fixed).
- Uses new common letters: L, O, U, D.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids R, A, N, E.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters are in the word and their positions.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""cloud""
- C: ✓ (already known first letter, so confirmed)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has O in the third position.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the second position (since in ""cloud"", L was in the second position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Also, we know the first letter is C, third is O, and the word has an L somewhere (but not in position 2).

Since the word has L and it's not in position 2, and we know the positions we have so far: C _ O _ _

We need to find a word that fits: C _ O _ _ and contains L (but not in position 2) and does not contain R, A, N, E, U, D.

Additionally, we have to avoid these letters.

Now, for the third guess, we want to test possible positions for L and also get information about the other letters.

We know L is in the word but not in position 2. So it could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already C, so L cannot be in position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L

But we don't know which, so we need to test.

We also need to find the missing letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5, depending on where L is).

We should choose a word that has the known letters in place: first C, third O, and includes L in either position 4 or 5.

But we also need to test other common letters for the remaining positions.

We have to avoid: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Available common letters: S, T, I, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the form: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L, and uses new letters to test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that tests one scenario and also gets information about the other.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.

Let me list possible words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

First, if L is in position 4: then the word is C _ O L _

Possible words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's 5 letters? C, O, L, L, Y? But we have two L's? And position 2 would be O? But O is already in position 3, so if we put O in position 2, that would be a different position. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had O in position 3 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In ""cloud"", O was in position 3 and got ✓, and we don't have any other O. So it's possible the word has only one O.

But we don't know for sure.

However, we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we haven't seen evidence.

Let's think of words: C _ O L _

With the available letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we haven't tested many vowels or consonants.

We know A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but O is already used. E and A are excluded. U is excluded. So vowels left: I, O ( possibly repeated, but we don't know). O is already in position 3, so if we use O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

But we can try.

Consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common ones.

Words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's ""colly"" which is not common. And it has two L's. But we don't know if L is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong position, but if the word has two L's, then one L might be in the correct position? But in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about other positions. So if the word has two L's, then one of them might be in the correct position, but we don't have a correct position for L yet.

In ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", so L is not in position 2, but it is in the word.

Now, if we consider a word with L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then position 2 is a letter that is not L (since L is in 4), and position 5 is another letter.

Possible words: 
- C H O L Y? ""Choly"" is not a word.
- C O L D S? But D is excluded.
- C O L M S? ""Colms"" not a word.
- C O L T S? ""Colds"" is a word: C O L D S -> but D is excluded, so not.
- C O L L Y? ""Colly"" is a word (informal for coal), but it has two L's. And we don't know if L is repeated.

But we can try ""colly"", but it has L in position 2 and 4? In ""colly"": C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. But in our case, we need position 3 to be O, which it is, but position 2 would be O? That would be a problem because we have O in position 3, but if we put O in position 2, it might be a different O? Or it could be repeated.

But in the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and U in position 4 wrong. But we don't have information about O in other positions.

However, we know that the word has at least one O (in position 3). It might have another O? But we don't know.

Similarly, for L: we know it's in the word but not in position 2. If we use a word with L in position 4, then we can test if L is in position 4.

But we also need to test position 2 and 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5: C _ O _ L

Then the word is C _ O ? L

Possible words: 
- C O V E L? But E is excluded.
- C O M B L? ""Comb"" is 4 letters, ""Comb"" is 4, not 5.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 3 must be O, not I. So not.

We need position 3 to be O.

So C _ O _ L

Examples:
- C O V E L -> but E is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O L L Y? But that has L in position 4 and 5? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O ? L

Possible: 
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C R O W L? But R is excluded.
- C A V I L? A is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.

Actually, ""cable"" is C A B L E, but A and E excluded.

Another: ""chose"" -> C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" -> C L O S E, but L is in position 2? We need position 3 to be O, so ""close"" is C L O S E -> position 3 is O, but position 2 is L. But we know L is not in position 2? No, we know from ""cloud"" that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""close"", if we put L in position 2, it would be wrong because we know L is not in position 2. But we are trying to test L in position 5? No, in this case, for the new guess, we want to test L in position 5.

But let's list words that fit C _ O _ L

With the blank in position 2 and position 4.

Position 2: must be a letter not excluded, and not L (since L is in position 5).

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So available: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Now, position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C H O K L? Not a word.
- C H O Y L? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> position 3 is I, not O. So not.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern C _ O _ L.

What about ""chose""? But E is excluded.

""close"" has L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Another: ""cable"" is excluded.

Perhaps ""coyly""? C O Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y? Not O.

I think it's hard to find a word with C _ O _ L.

What about ""comply""? But that's 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""civic"" -> C I V I C, but position 3 is V, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try the other scenario: L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then the word is C ? O L ?

Position 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: 
- C H O L M? ""Cholm"" not a word.
- C H O L S? ""Chols"" not a word, but ""chol"" is not 5.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O L ?

So position 2 and 5.

Examples:
- C H O L S? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5.
- C O I L S? ""Coils"" is C O I L S -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S -> but position 3 is I, not O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the third letter must be O.

So the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for position 3, then L for position 4, then any letter for position 5.

But is there a word like that?

- C H O L K? Not a word.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Position 1: C
Position 2: ?
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
Position 5: ?

But in the word ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L is in the word but not in position 2.

In this new guess, if we put L in position 4, then we can see if it's correct or not.

But we need a valid word.

Let me think of words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

We already have C and O fixed.

So the word is C ? O ? ?

And the ? must include L and one other letter.

But we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either:
- C ? O L ?  (L in position 4)
- C ? O ? L  (L in position 5)

Now, for the second guess, we tested ""cloud"" which is C L O U D, and we got L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, but U and D are absent.

Now, for the third guess, we can try to test L in position 4 and also test other common letters.

But we need to choose a word that fits one of the patterns.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5 to test that scenario.

But let's list possible words.

Since we have limited options, we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the known letters and tests common letters for the unknown positions.

We know C and O are fixed, so we can only change positions 2, 4, 5.

But we have to include L in either position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with C in 1, O in 3, and L in 4: C ? O L ?

Possible words:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""colly"" has position 3 as L, not O.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there are no common words with C _ O L _.

What about ""comply"" but that's 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

Perhaps ""chole"" but E is excluded.

I think it's more likely that L is in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for 3, then L for 5.

So words: C ? O ? L

Examples:
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, but E is excluded and L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. Also, E is excluded.
- ""cable"" -> C A B L E, A and E excluded.
- ""civic"" -> C I V I C, position 3 is V, not O.
- ""crock"" -> C R O C K, but R is excluded and position 3 is O? C R O C K -> position 1:C, 2:R (excluded), 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> but R is excluded, so not.
- ""cough"" -> C O U G H, but U is excluded.
- ""could"" -> C O U L D, but U and D are excluded.

All these have issues.

What about ""chose""? C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Another: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""cowl"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to consider that L might be in position 4, but I can't find a word.

Let's try a different approach: we know L is in the word, so we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

For example, ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

""colly"" is not.

What about ""colza""? C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think we have to consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word that tests that.

So let's try the pattern C ? O ? L

With ? not in the excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we have many, but not the excluded ones.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Position 5: similarly.

Now, what words are there?

- ""close"": but E is excluded and L is in position 2 which is invalid.

- ""cable"": A and E excluded.

- ""civic"": position 3 is V, not O.

I think we might have to use a word that doesn't have L in position 4 or 5? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> but position 3 is L, not O.

Another idea: ""chose"" is C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Perhaps ""cough"" but U is excluded.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""cloy"" but that's 4 letters.

Or ""crock"" but R is excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words starting with C, third letter O, and containing L, and not containing R,A,N,E,U,D.

And L must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""chill"" -> C H I L L, but position 3 is I, not O. So not.
- ""chomp"" -> C H O M P, no L.
- ""chord"" -> C H O R D, R and D excluded.
- ""chose"" -> C H O S E, E excluded.
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, E excluded, and L in position 2 which is invalid (we know L is not in position 2).
- ""cloy"" -> 4 letters.
- ""crock"" -> R excluded.
- ""croup"" -> C R O U P, R and U excluded.
- ""crown"" -> R and N excluded.
- ""crown"" is 5 but R and N excluded.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

""block"" is B L O C K, but first letter is B, not C.

We need C first.

""clomp"" is C L O M P, but L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

""clomp"" has L in position 2, which we know is not possible because from ""cloud"" feedback, L is not in position 2.

So we cannot use ""clomp"" because it has L in position 2.

Similarly, ""chomp"" has no L.

We need a word that has L in position 4 or 5.

Let's try L in position 4: C ? O L ?

With ? not excluded.

Possible:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""col"" is not 5.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there is no common word with C _ O L _.

What about ""comet"" -> C O M E T, but E is excluded and position 3 is M, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try L in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, ?, O, ?, L

Position 2 and 4 are unknown.

Words:
- ""close"": C L O S E -> but E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.
- ""cable"": A and E excluded.
- ""civic"": C I V I C -> position 3 is V, not O.
- ""cough"": U excluded.
- ""could"": U and D excluded.
- ""chill"": C H I L L -> position 3 is I, not O.
- ""chomp"": no L.
- ""chord"": R and D excluded.
- ""chose"": E excluded.
- ""close"" is the only common one, but E excluded.

But there is ""cloy"" but 4 letters.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

Perhaps ""croup"" is out.

I think we might have to consider that the word is ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters, so not.

Or ""bloat"" but first letter B.

We need to use a word that has L in position 4 or 5, and uses available letters.

Let's try to use a word that has L in position 4: but I can't find one.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

I recall that ""colly"" is not, but position 3 is L.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is 5 but position 3 is L.

Perhaps ""cooly"" -> C O O L Y -> but position 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is O, which is good, and position 4 is L.

But position 2 is O. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if O is repeated.

In ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we put O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

Also, we have L in position 4.

And the word has O repeated? But that's possible.

Now, check excluded: O is not excluded, L is in the word, and Y is not excluded.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a valid word: C O O L Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

Also, position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

So let's consider ""cooly"".

But we have two O's? The word ""cooly"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, but if there is another O, it might be marked as present or not? The feedback only marks each letter individually.

In ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and if there is another O in the word, but in ""cloud"" we only have one O, so if the word has two O's, then the O in position 3 is correct, and if we don't have another O in the guess, we don't know.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

So if we guess ""cooly"", we can test if there is an O in position 2.

Also, we test L in position 4.

And Y in position 5.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But let's see if it fits the known information.

If the secret word is ""cooly"", then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: O ? 
- Position 3: O ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: L ? 
- Position 5: Y ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

In ""cooly"", position 2 is O, position 3 is O.

But we don't know if the word has two O's.

Another candidate: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

""cooly"" is 5 letters.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cough"" excluded U.

""could"" excluded U and D.

""close"" excluded E.

""chill"" excluded I? Not, position 3 is I.

We need position 3 to be O.

So ""cooly"" seems a possibility.

But we have to test if L is in position 4.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is L, not O. So not.

""colza"" is C O L Z A, position 3 is L.

Not.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Another 5-letter word: ""coyly"" -> C O Y L Y, position 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is Y, not O. So not.

""cooly"" is the best so far.

But let's confirm the pattern: C O O L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

But we don't know if position 2 is O.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, and we have O in position 3 correct.

If the word is ""cooly"", then in ""cloud"", we had L in position 2, but in ""cooly"", L is in position 4, so that matches the feedback: L is in the word but not in position 2.

Also, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which is not tested in ""cloud"" because ""cloud"" had O in position 3.

So it's possible.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not 5.

""folly"" is F O L L Y, but first letter F.

We need C first.

""cloy"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is considered 5? No, it's 4.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cable"" is out.

""comply"" is 6.

""close"" is out.

""chase"" -> C H A S E, A and E excluded.

""chime"" -> C H I M E, E excluded.

""shine"" -> S H I N E, not C.

I think it's hard.

Another word: ""civic"" is not.

Perhaps ""coyly"" but position 3 is Y, not O.

I think ""cooly"" is a good guess.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we guess ""cooly"", and if position 2 is O, it might be correct or not.

But we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to test if O is repeated.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" has position 3 as L.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"" or similar.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""crock"" but R excluded.

""block"" not C.

Another idea: ""chomp"" has no L.

We need to include L.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5.

I recall ""cooly"" is a word.

Or ""cloy"" is not.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cabal"" has A and position 3 is A, not O.

I think we have to use ""cooly"" or a similar word.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2.

We can also try ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think ""cooly"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

I think it's rare.

Another word: ""cavil"" -> C A V I L, A excluded, position 3 is V.

Not.

So I think ""cooly"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have to avoid U and D, which we are.

So let's go with ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

We can also test other letters.

But we know position 3 is O, so we don't need to test position 3 again.

We need to test position 2 and the other positions.

In ""cooly"", we test:
- Position 1: C (should be ✓)
- Position 2: O (we don't know, could be correct or not)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
- Position 5: Y

If we get feedback that position 2 is O, then we know position 2 is O, and position 4 L? But if position 2 is O, then position 4 might be L or not.

But we are testing.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 4 and a vowel in position 2.

For example, ""chol"" not.

""colza"" has position 3 as L.

Not.

""comol"" not.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"".

But we have another option: we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""cavil"" not.

Perhaps ""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the best bet.

But let's consider ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think we have to use ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have two O's.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think we should go with ""cooly"".

But let's think of ""colly"" but position 3 is L.

I think we have to accept that.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""cooly"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""cooly"", then:
- C: ✓
- O: ✓ (position 3)
- O: ? in position 2, if it's O, then ✓, else if it's not, then x or -.
- L: if in position 4, then ✓, else if L is in position 5, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But if L is in position 5, then in ""cooly"" position 4 is L, but if the word has L in position 5, then position 4 L would be marked as absent? Or if the word has only one L, then position 4 L would be x if L is in position 5.

Let's simulate:

Suppose secret word is ""cooly"":
- Guess: C O O L Y
- Position 1: C = ✓
- Position 2: O = ✓ (if the secret has O in position 2, then ✓, else if O is only in position 3, then it might be x or -)
- Position 3: O = ✓
- Position 4: L = ✓ if L is in position 4, else if L is in position 5, then it would be - (because L is in the word but not in position 4, since it's in position 5)
- Position 5: Y = ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to avoid confusion.

For example, a word with L in position 4: but we can't find one.

What about ""chol"" is not 5.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there is ""colly"", but position 3 is L.

Not.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is the best.

So third guess: ""cooly""

But let's confirm the letters: C, O, O, L, Y

O is repeated, but that's okay.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Or ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is 5.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This indicates that the first letter is **C**, and the letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
  - This confirms the first letter is **C** and the third letter is **O**. The letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2. The letters U and D are **not** in the word. Additionally, from guess 1, R, A, N, E, U, and D are now excluded.

**Known information:**
- The word starts with **C** and has **O** in the third position: **C _ O _ _**
- **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for the third guess:**
- We need to test the position of **L** (position 4 or 5) and gather information about the other positions.
- Since we cannot find a common word with **L** in position 4 (due to constraints), we prioritize testing **L** in position 5 and introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 4.
- The word **""cooly""** fits the pattern: **C _ O _ L**. It tests:
  - **C** in position 1 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 3 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 2 (tests if **O** is repeated).
  - **L** in position 4 (tests if **L** is in position 4 or 5).
  - **Y** in position 5 (tests a new letter).
- This guess uses available letters, avoids exclusions, and maximizes information gain.

<guess>cooly</guess>",cooly,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""cloud""
- C: ✓ (already known first letter, so confirmed)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has O in the third position.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the second position (since in ""cloud"", L was in the second position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Also, we know the first letter is C, third is O, and the word has an L somewhere (but not in position 2).

Since the word has L and it's not in position 2, and we know the positions we have so far: C _ O _ _

We need to find a word that fits: C _ O _ _ and contains L (but not in position 2) and does not contain R, A, N, E, U, D.

Additionally, we have to avoid these letters.

Now, for the third guess, we want to test possible positions for L and also get information about the other letters.

We know L is in the word but not in position 2. So it could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already C, so L cannot be in position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L

But we don't know which, so we need to test.

We also need to find the missing letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5, depending on where L is).

We should choose a word that has the known letters in place: first C, third O, and includes L in either position 4 or 5.

But we also need to test other common letters for the remaining positions.

We have to avoid: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Available common letters: S, T, I, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the form: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L, and uses new letters to test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that tests one scenario and also gets information about the other.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.

Let me list possible words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

First, if L is in position 4: then the word is C _ O L _

Possible words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's 5 letters? C, O, L, L, Y? But we have two L's? And position 2 would be O? But O is already in position 3, so if we put O in position 2, that would be a different position. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had O in position 3 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In ""cloud"", O was in position 3 and got ✓, and we don't have any other O. So it's possible the word has only one O.

But we don't know for sure.

However, we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we haven't seen evidence.

Let's think of words: C _ O L _

With the available letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we haven't tested many vowels or consonants.

We know A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but O is already used. E and A are excluded. U is excluded. So vowels left: I, O ( possibly repeated, but we don't know). O is already in position 3, so if we use O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

But we can try.

Consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common ones.

Words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's ""colly"" which is not common. And it has two L's. But we don't know if L is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong position, but if the word has two L's, then one L might be in the correct position? But in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about other positions. So if the word has two L's, then one of them might be in the correct position, but we don't have a correct position for L yet.

In ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", so L is not in position 2, but it is in the word.

Now, if we consider a word with L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then position 2 is a letter that is not L (since L is in 4), and position 5 is another letter.

Possible words: 
- C H O L Y? ""Choly"" is not a word.
- C O L D S? But D is excluded.
- C O L M S? ""Colms"" not a word.
- C O L T S? ""Colds"" is a word: C O L D S -> but D is excluded, so not.
- C O L L Y? ""Colly"" is a word (informal for coal), but it has two L's. And we don't know if L is repeated.

But we can try ""colly"", but it has L in position 2 and 4? In ""colly"": C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. But in our case, we need position 3 to be O, which it is, but position 2 would be O? That would be a problem because we have O in position 3, but if we put O in position 2, it might be a different O? Or it could be repeated.

But in the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and U in position 4 wrong. But we don't have information about O in other positions.

However, we know that the word has at least one O (in position 3). It might have another O? But we don't know.

Similarly, for L: we know it's in the word but not in position 2. If we use a word with L in position 4, then we can test if L is in position 4.

But we also need to test position 2 and 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5: C _ O _ L

Then the word is C _ O ? L

Possible words: 
- C O V E L? But E is excluded.
- C O M B L? ""Comb"" is 4 letters, ""Comb"" is 4, not 5.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 3 must be O, not I. So not.

We need position 3 to be O.

So C _ O _ L

Examples:
- C O V E L -> but E is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O L L Y? But that has L in position 4 and 5? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O ? L

Possible: 
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C R O W L? But R is excluded.
- C A V I L? A is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.

Actually, ""cable"" is C A B L E, but A and E excluded.

Another: ""chose"" -> C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" -> C L O S E, but L is in position 2? We need position 3 to be O, so ""close"" is C L O S E -> position 3 is O, but position 2 is L. But we know L is not in position 2? No, we know from ""cloud"" that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""close"", if we put L in position 2, it would be wrong because we know L is not in position 2. But we are trying to test L in position 5? No, in this case, for the new guess, we want to test L in position 5.

But let's list words that fit C _ O _ L

With the blank in position 2 and position 4.

Position 2: must be a letter not excluded, and not L (since L is in position 5).

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So available: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Now, position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C H O K L? Not a word.
- C H O Y L? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> position 3 is I, not O. So not.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern C _ O _ L.

What about ""chose""? But E is excluded.

""close"" has L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Another: ""cable"" is excluded.

Perhaps ""coyly""? C O Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y? Not O.

I think it's hard to find a word with C _ O _ L.

What about ""comply""? But that's 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""civic"" -> C I V I C, but position 3 is V, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try the other scenario: L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then the word is C ? O L ?

Position 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: 
- C H O L M? ""Cholm"" not a word.
- C H O L S? ""Chols"" not a word, but ""chol"" is not 5.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O L ?

So position 2 and 5.

Examples:
- C H O L S? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5.
- C O I L S? ""Coils"" is C O I L S -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S -> but position 3 is I, not O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the third letter must be O.

So the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for position 3, then L for position 4, then any letter for position 5.

But is there a word like that?

- C H O L K? Not a word.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Position 1: C
Position 2: ?
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
Position 5: ?

But in the word ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L is in the word but not in position 2.

In this new guess, if we put L in position 4, then we can see if it's correct or not.

But we need a valid word.

Let me think of words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

We already have C and O fixed.

So the word is C ? O ? ?

And the ? must include L and one other letter.

But we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either:
- C ? O L ?  (L in position 4)
- C ? O ? L  (L in position 5)

Now, for the second guess, we tested ""cloud"" which is C L O U D, and we got L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, but U and D are absent.

Now, for the third guess, we can try to test L in position 4 and also test other common letters.

But we need to choose a word that fits one of the patterns.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5 to test that scenario.

But let's list possible words.

Since we have limited options, we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the known letters and tests common letters for the unknown positions.

We know C and O are fixed, so we can only change positions 2, 4, 5.

But we have to include L in either position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with C in 1, O in 3, and L in 4: C ? O L ?

Possible words:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""colly"" has position 3 as L, not O.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there are no common words with C _ O L _.

What about ""comply"" but that's 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

Perhaps ""chole"" but E is excluded.

I think it's more likely that L is in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for 3, then L for 5.

So words: C ? O ? L

Examples:
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, but E is excluded and L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. Also, E is excluded.
- ""cable"" -> C A B L E, A and E excluded.
- ""civic"" -> C I V I C, position 3 is V, not O.
- ""crock"" -> C R O C K, but R is excluded and position 3 is O? C R O C K -> position 1:C, 2:R (excluded), 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> but R is excluded, so not.
- ""cough"" -> C O U G H, but U is excluded.
- ""could"" -> C O U L D, but U and D are excluded.

All these have issues.

What about ""chose""? C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Another: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""cowl"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to consider that L might be in position 4, but I can't find a word.

Let's try a different approach: we know L is in the word, so we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

For example, ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

""colly"" is not.

What about ""colza""? C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think we have to consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word that tests that.

So let's try the pattern C ? O ? L

With ? not in the excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we have many, but not the excluded ones.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Position 5: similarly.

Now, what words are there?

- ""close"": but E is excluded and L is in position 2 which is invalid.

- ""cable"": A and E excluded.

- ""civic"": position 3 is V, not O.

I think we might have to use a word that doesn't have L in position 4 or 5? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> but position 3 is L, not O.

Another idea: ""chose"" is C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Perhaps ""cough"" but U is excluded.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""cloy"" but that's 4 letters.

Or ""crock"" but R is excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words starting with C, third letter O, and containing L, and not containing R,A,N,E,U,D.

And L must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""chill"" -> C H I L L, but position 3 is I, not O. So not.
- ""chomp"" -> C H O M P, no L.
- ""chord"" -> C H O R D, R and D excluded.
- ""chose"" -> C H O S E, E excluded.
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, E excluded, and L in position 2 which is invalid (we know L is not in position 2).
- ""cloy"" -> 4 letters.
- ""crock"" -> R excluded.
- ""croup"" -> C R O U P, R and U excluded.
- ""crown"" -> R and N excluded.
- ""crown"" is 5 but R and N excluded.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

""block"" is B L O C K, but first letter is B, not C.

We need C first.

""clomp"" is C L O M P, but L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

""clomp"" has L in position 2, which we know is not possible because from ""cloud"" feedback, L is not in position 2.

So we cannot use ""clomp"" because it has L in position 2.

Similarly, ""chomp"" has no L.

We need a word that has L in position 4 or 5.

Let's try L in position 4: C ? O L ?

With ? not excluded.

Possible:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""col"" is not 5.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there is no common word with C _ O L _.

What about ""comet"" -> C O M E T, but E is excluded and position 3 is M, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try L in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, ?, O, ?, L

Position 2 and 4 are unknown.

Words:
- ""close"": C L O S E -> but E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.
- ""cable"": A and E excluded.
- ""civic"": C I V I C -> position 3 is V, not O.
- ""cough"": U excluded.
- ""could"": U and D excluded.
- ""chill"": C H I L L -> position 3 is I, not O.
- ""chomp"": no L.
- ""chord"": R and D excluded.
- ""chose"": E excluded.
- ""close"" is the only common one, but E excluded.

But there is ""cloy"" but 4 letters.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

Perhaps ""croup"" is out.

I think we might have to consider that the word is ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters, so not.

Or ""bloat"" but first letter B.

We need to use a word that has L in position 4 or 5, and uses available letters.

Let's try to use a word that has L in position 4: but I can't find one.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

I recall that ""colly"" is not, but position 3 is L.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is 5 but position 3 is L.

Perhaps ""cooly"" -> C O O L Y -> but position 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is O, which is good, and position 4 is L.

But position 2 is O. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if O is repeated.

In ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we put O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

Also, we have L in position 4.

And the word has O repeated? But that's possible.

Now, check excluded: O is not excluded, L is in the word, and Y is not excluded.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a valid word: C O O L Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

Also, position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

So let's consider ""cooly"".

But we have two O's? The word ""cooly"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, but if there is another O, it might be marked as present or not? The feedback only marks each letter individually.

In ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and if there is another O in the word, but in ""cloud"" we only have one O, so if the word has two O's, then the O in position 3 is correct, and if we don't have another O in the guess, we don't know.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

So if we guess ""cooly"", we can test if there is an O in position 2.

Also, we test L in position 4.

And Y in position 5.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But let's see if it fits the known information.

If the secret word is ""cooly"", then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: O ? 
- Position 3: O ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: L ? 
- Position 5: Y ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

In ""cooly"", position 2 is O, position 3 is O.

But we don't know if the word has two O's.

Another candidate: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

""cooly"" is 5 letters.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cough"" excluded U.

""could"" excluded U and D.

""close"" excluded E.

""chill"" excluded I? Not, position 3 is I.

We need position 3 to be O.

So ""cooly"" seems a possibility.

But we have to test if L is in position 4.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is L, not O. So not.

""colza"" is C O L Z A, position 3 is L.

Not.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Another 5-letter word: ""coyly"" -> C O Y L Y, position 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is Y, not O. So not.

""cooly"" is the best so far.

But let's confirm the pattern: C O O L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

But we don't know if position 2 is O.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, and we have O in position 3 correct.

If the word is ""cooly"", then in ""cloud"", we had L in position 2, but in ""cooly"", L is in position 4, so that matches the feedback: L is in the word but not in position 2.

Also, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which is not tested in ""cloud"" because ""cloud"" had O in position 3.

So it's possible.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not 5.

""folly"" is F O L L Y, but first letter F.

We need C first.

""cloy"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is considered 5? No, it's 4.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cable"" is out.

""comply"" is 6.

""close"" is out.

""chase"" -> C H A S E, A and E excluded.

""chime"" -> C H I M E, E excluded.

""shine"" -> S H I N E, not C.

I think it's hard.

Another word: ""civic"" is not.

Perhaps ""coyly"" but position 3 is Y, not O.

I think ""cooly"" is a good guess.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we guess ""cooly"", and if position 2 is O, it might be correct or not.

But we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to test if O is repeated.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" has position 3 as L.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"" or similar.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""crock"" but R excluded.

""block"" not C.

Another idea: ""chomp"" has no L.

We need to include L.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5.

I recall ""cooly"" is a word.

Or ""cloy"" is not.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cabal"" has A and position 3 is A, not O.

I think we have to use ""cooly"" or a similar word.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2.

We can also try ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think ""cooly"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

I think it's rare.

Another word: ""cavil"" -> C A V I L, A excluded, position 3 is V.

Not.

So I think ""cooly"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have to avoid U and D, which we are.

So let's go with ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

We can also test other letters.

But we know position 3 is O, so we don't need to test position 3 again.

We need to test position 2 and the other positions.

In ""cooly"", we test:
- Position 1: C (should be ✓)
- Position 2: O (we don't know, could be correct or not)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
- Position 5: Y

If we get feedback that position 2 is O, then we know position 2 is O, and position 4 L? But if position 2 is O, then position 4 might be L or not.

But we are testing.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 4 and a vowel in position 2.

For example, ""chol"" not.

""colza"" has position 3 as L.

Not.

""comol"" not.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"".

But we have another option: we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""cavil"" not.

Perhaps ""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the best bet.

But let's consider ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think we have to use ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have two O's.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think we should go with ""cooly"".

But let's think of ""colly"" but position 3 is L.

I think we have to accept that.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""cooly"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""cooly"", then:
- C: ✓
- O: ✓ (position 3)
- O: ? in position 2, if it's O, then ✓, else if it's not, then x or -.
- L: if in position 4, then ✓, else if L is in position 5, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But if L is in position 5, then in ""cooly"" position 4 is L, but if the word has L in position 5, then position 4 L would be marked as absent? Or if the word has only one L, then position 4 L would be x if L is in position 5.

Let's simulate:

Suppose secret word is ""cooly"":
- Guess: C O O L Y
- Position 1: C = ✓
- Position 2: O = ✓ (if the secret has O in position 2, then ✓, else if O is only in position 3, then it might be x or -)
- Position 3: O = ✓
- Position 4: L = ✓ if L is in position 4, else if L is in position 5, then it would be - (because L is in the word but not in position 4, since it's in position 5)
- Position 5: Y = ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to avoid confusion.

For example, a word with L in position 4: but we can't find one.

What about ""chol"" is not 5.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there is ""colly"", but position 3 is L.

Not.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is the best.

So third guess: ""cooly""

But let's confirm the letters: C, O, O, L, Y

O is repeated, but that's okay.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Or ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is 5.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This indicates that the first letter is **C**, and the letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
  - This confirms the first letter is **C** and the third letter is **O**. The letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2. The letters U and D are **not** in the word. Additionally, from guess 1, R, A, N, E, U, and D are now excluded.

**Known information:**
- The word starts with **C** and has **O** in the third position: **C _ O _ _**
- **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for the third guess:**
- We need to test the position of **L** (position 4 or 5) and gather information about the other positions.
- Since we cannot find a common word with **L** in position 4 (due to constraints), we prioritize testing **L** in position 5 and introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 4.
- The word **""cooly""** fits the pattern: **C _ O _ L**. It tests:
  - **C** in position 1 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 3 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 2 (tests if **O** is repeated).
  - **L** in position 4 (tests if **L** is in position 4 or 5).
  - **Y** in position 5 (tests a new letter).
- This guess uses available letters, avoids exclusions, and maximizes information gain.",Guess 3: cooly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, the secret word has the letter 'C' in the first position. The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word starts with 'C' and does not contain R, A, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Starts with 'C' (since we know the first letter is C)
- Does not contain R, A, N, E (since they are not in the word)
- Uses other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the letter 'C' in the first position and then uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- We know the word must start with C and not have R, A, N, E.

Let's think of 5-letter words starting with C that avoid R, A, N, E.

Some options:
- ""CLOUD"": uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don't know if these are in the word.
- ""CHILL"": has double L, which might not be efficient for getting information.
- ""CIVIC"": has repeated C and I, but we already know the first letter is C, so we don't need to test C again? Actually, we know the first letter is C, but the word might have another C? However, we don't have information about other positions.

But note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""crane"". Since the first letter is C and it's correct, we know that the word starts with C. The other letters (R, A, N, E) are absent.

So, for the second guess, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses other common letters that we haven't tested.

Let me list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:

- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D
- ""COULD"": C, O, U, L, D -> same as above but with different order?
- ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P
- ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B
- ""COAST"": but has A (which is excluded) -> not allowed because A is not in the word.
- ""CROSS"": has R (excluded) and S, S -> but R is excluded.

We must avoid R, A, N, E.

Another idea: ""CLOUD"" is a valid word and uses C, L, O, U, D. All these letters are new.

But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.

Another common starting word is ""SLATE"", but it starts with S, not C. We know the first letter is C, so we can't use that.

We can try ""CHILL"", but it has two L's. It might be less informative.

Alternatively, ""CIVIC"" has two C's and I's. But we know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. However, we are avoiding R, A, N, E.

But let's think about the feedback: we have only one letter fixed (C in position 1). We need to test other positions.

Another word: ""COMET"" -> but has E (excluded) and M, O, T.

E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

Similarly, we cannot use R, A, N.

So, let's avoid E and use other vowels? The word must have vowels? The known letters are C (which is a consonant) and we don't know about others. But we know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do.

Vowels we haven't tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let's avoid for now).

We can try ""CLOUD"" or ""CHIMP"" or ""CLIMB"".

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we get to test L, O, U, D.

But note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses letters that are common and distinct to maximize information.

Another idea: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D. This is similar to ""CLOUD"" but rearranged.

But ""CLOUD"" is a common word.

We can also consider ""CUSHION"", but that has 6 letters? No, 5 letters: C-U-S-H-I-O? 5 letters: C, U, S, H, I? But we need 5 letters.

Let me check: ""CUSHION"" is 6 letters. So not.

Another 5-letter word: ""CIVIC"" -> but has two C's and two I's. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don't know if there is another C. Also, we are testing I.

But we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""CIVIC"" does not contain these, so it's acceptable.

However, using two C's might not be efficient because if we get a feedback for the second C, we might not know if it's in the word or not? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is present. But if we use two C's, then we are testing the same letter in two positions. If the word has only one C, then one of the C's will be marked as absent? But the feedback marks each letter individually.

Let me clarify the rules: for each letter, we get a symbol: 
  - ✓: correct letter and position
  - -: letter in word but wrong position
  - x: letter not in word.

So if we use two C's, and the word has only one C (in the first position), then the first C will be ✓ and the second C will be x (because the word only has one C and it's already used in the first position). But if the word has two C's, then both might be marked appropriately.

However, we don't know if the word has more than one C. So it might be inefficient.

Therefore, it's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So, let's avoid repeating letters for now.

Back to ""CLOUD"": C (fixed), L, O, U, D -> all distinct and new.

Similarly, ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P -> distinct and new.

We can also consider ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B -> distinct.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

Another word: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> distinct.

I think ""CLOUD"" is a good choice.

But let me check if ""CLOUD"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (the one in the first position is a consonant, but we don't know about others). Actually, we don't have information about vowels because we only tested A and E and they were absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or Y.

So, including a vowel (O or U) is good.

""CLOUD"" has O and U.

So, I'll go with ""CLOUD"".

But wait: what about the position of the known letter? We are keeping C in the first position, which is correct.

So, our second guess: ""CLOUD""

We'll get feedback on L, O, U, D.

If we get a ✓ for any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but not in that position. If x, then not in the word.

This will help us narrow down.

So, the guess is ""cloud"".

But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""cloud"" is a valid English word.

Therefore, I choose ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in the first position (✓).
- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all (x).

This means:
- The secret word starts with ""C"".
- The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.
- We need to avoid these letters in our next guess.

For the second guess, we should:
- Keep ""C"" in the first position (since it's confirmed correct).
- Use other common letters that haven't been tested yet (e.g., L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, S, T).
- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information gain.
- Avoid R, A, N, E.

The word ""cloud"" fits these criteria:
- Starts with ""C"" (first position fixed).
- Uses new common letters: L, O, U, D.
- All letters are distinct.
- Avoids R, A, N, E.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters are in the word and their positions.

<guess>cloud</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""cloud""
- C: ✓ (already known first letter, so confirmed)
- L: - (in the word but wrong position)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)
- U: x (not in the word)
- D: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has O in the third position.
2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the second position (since in ""cloud"", L was in the second position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not there).
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Also, we know the first letter is C, third is O, and the word has an L somewhere (but not in position 2).

Since the word has L and it's not in position 2, and we know the positions we have so far: C _ O _ _

We need to find a word that fits: C _ O _ _ and contains L (but not in position 2) and does not contain R, A, N, E, U, D.

Additionally, we have to avoid these letters.

Now, for the third guess, we want to test possible positions for L and also get information about the other letters.

We know L is in the word but not in position 2. So it could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already C, so L cannot be in position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L

But we don't know which, so we need to test.

We also need to find the missing letters.

We have two unknown positions: position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5, depending on where L is).

We should choose a word that has the known letters in place: first C, third O, and includes L in either position 4 or 5.

But we also need to test other common letters for the remaining positions.

We have to avoid: R, A, N, E, U, D.

Available common letters: S, T, I, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We can try to use a word that has the form: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L, and uses new letters to test.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose a word that tests one scenario and also gets information about the other.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.

Let me list possible words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

First, if L is in position 4: then the word is C _ O L _

Possible words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's 5 letters? C, O, L, L, Y? But we have two L's? And position 2 would be O? But O is already in position 3, so if we put O in position 2, that would be a different position. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had O in position 3 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In ""cloud"", O was in position 3 and got ✓, and we don't have any other O. So it's possible the word has only one O.

But we don't know for sure.

However, we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we haven't seen evidence.

Let's think of words: C _ O L _

With the available letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we haven't tested many vowels or consonants.

We know A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but O is already used. E and A are excluded. U is excluded. So vowels left: I, O ( possibly repeated, but we don't know). O is already in position 3, so if we use O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

But we can try.

Consonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common ones.

Words: 
- C O L L Y? But that's ""colly"" which is not common. And it has two L's. But we don't know if L is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong position, but if the word has two L's, then one L might be in the correct position? But in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn't say anything about other positions. So if the word has two L's, then one of them might be in the correct position, but we don't have a correct position for L yet.

In ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", so L is not in position 2, but it is in the word.

Now, if we consider a word with L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then position 2 is a letter that is not L (since L is in 4), and position 5 is another letter.

Possible words: 
- C H O L Y? ""Choly"" is not a word.
- C O L D S? But D is excluded.
- C O L M S? ""Colms"" not a word.
- C O L T S? ""Colds"" is a word: C O L D S -> but D is excluded, so not.
- C O L L Y? ""Colly"" is a word (informal for coal), but it has two L's. And we don't know if L is repeated.

But we can try ""colly"", but it has L in position 2 and 4? In ""colly"": C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. But in our case, we need position 3 to be O, which it is, but position 2 would be O? That would be a problem because we have O in position 3, but if we put O in position 2, it might be a different O? Or it could be repeated.

But in the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and U in position 4 wrong. But we don't have information about O in other positions.

However, we know that the word has at least one O (in position 3). It might have another O? But we don't know.

Similarly, for L: we know it's in the word but not in position 2. If we use a word with L in position 4, then we can test if L is in position 4.

But we also need to test position 2 and 5.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5: C _ O _ L

Then the word is C _ O ? L

Possible words: 
- C O V E L? But E is excluded.
- C O M B L? ""Comb"" is 4 letters, ""Comb"" is 4, not 5.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 3 must be O, not I. So not.

We need position 3 to be O.

So C _ O _ L

Examples:
- C O V E L -> but E is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O L L Y? But that has L in position 4 and 5? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O ? L

Possible: 
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C R O W L? But R is excluded.
- C A V I L? A is excluded.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.

Actually, ""cable"" is C A B L E, but A and E excluded.

Another: ""chose"" -> C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" -> C L O S E, but L is in position 2? We need position 3 to be O, so ""close"" is C L O S E -> position 3 is O, but position 2 is L. But we know L is not in position 2? No, we know from ""cloud"" that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""close"", if we put L in position 2, it would be wrong because we know L is not in position 2. But we are trying to test L in position 5? No, in this case, for the new guess, we want to test L in position 5.

But let's list words that fit C _ O _ L

With the blank in position 2 and position 4.

Position 2: must be a letter not excluded, and not L (since L is in position 5).

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So available: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common ones: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Now, position 4: similarly.

Possible words:
- C H O P L? Not a word.
- C H O K L? Not a word.
- C H O Y L? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.
- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> position 3 is I, not O. So not.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with the pattern C _ O _ L.

What about ""chose""? But E is excluded.

""close"" has L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

Another: ""cable"" is excluded.

Perhaps ""coyly""? C O Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y? Not O.

I think it's hard to find a word with C _ O _ L.

What about ""comply""? But that's 6 letters.

5-letter words: ""civic"" -> C I V I C, but position 3 is V, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try the other scenario: L in position 4: C _ O L _

Then the word is C ? O L ?

Position 2 and 5 to fill.

Words: 
- C H O L M? ""Cholm"" not a word.
- C H O L S? ""Chols"" not a word, but ""chol"" is not 5.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O L ?

So position 2 and 5.

Examples:
- C H O L S? Not a word.
- C O M B L? Not 5.
- C O I L S? ""Coils"" is C O I L S -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S -> but position 3 is I, not O. So not.

We need position 3 to be O, so the third letter must be O.

So the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for position 3, then L for position 4, then any letter for position 5.

But is there a word like that?

- C H O L K? Not a word.
- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Position 1: C
Position 2: ?
Position 3: O (fixed)
Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
Position 5: ?

But in the word ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L is in the word but not in position 2.

In this new guess, if we put L in position 4, then we can see if it's correct or not.

But we need a valid word.

Let me think of words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.

We already have C and O fixed.

So the word is C ? O ? ?

And the ? must include L and one other letter.

But we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

So the word is either:
- C ? O L ?  (L in position 4)
- C ? O ? L  (L in position 5)

Now, for the second guess, we tested ""cloud"" which is C L O U D, and we got L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, but U and D are absent.

Now, for the third guess, we can try to test L in position 4 and also test other common letters.

But we need to choose a word that fits one of the patterns.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5 to test that scenario.

But let's list possible words.

Since we have limited options, we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

But we don't know which pattern.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the known letters and tests common letters for the unknown positions.

We know C and O are fixed, so we can only change positions 2, 4, 5.

But we have to include L in either position 4 or 5.

Let me try to find words with C in 1, O in 3, and L in 4: C ? O L ?

Possible words:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""colly"" has position 3 as L, not O.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there are no common words with C _ O L _.

What about ""comply"" but that's 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.

Perhaps ""chole"" but E is excluded.

I think it's more likely that L is in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for 3, then L for 5.

So words: C ? O ? L

Examples:
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, but E is excluded and L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. Also, E is excluded.
- ""cable"" -> C A B L E, A and E excluded.
- ""civic"" -> C I V I C, position 3 is V, not O.
- ""crock"" -> C R O C K, but R is excluded and position 3 is O? C R O C K -> position 1:C, 2:R (excluded), 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> but R is excluded, so not.
- ""cough"" -> C O U G H, but U is excluded.
- ""could"" -> C O U L D, but U and D are excluded.

All these have issues.

What about ""chose""? C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Another: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""cowl"" is 4 letters.

I think we might have to consider that L might be in position 4, but I can't find a word.

Let's try a different approach: we know L is in the word, so we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.

For example, ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

""colly"" is not.

What about ""colza""? C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.

I think we have to consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word that tests that.

So let's try the pattern C ? O ? L

With ? not in the excluded letters.

Possible letters for position 2: we have many, but not the excluded ones.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

So position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common: H, I, M, P, S, T.

Position 5: similarly.

Now, what words are there?

- ""close"": but E is excluded and L is in position 2 which is invalid.

- ""cable"": A and E excluded.

- ""civic"": position 3 is V, not O.

I think we might have to use a word that doesn't have L in position 4 or 5? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.

Perhaps we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> but position 3 is L, not O.

Another idea: ""chose"" is C H O S E, but E is excluded.

""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.

Perhaps ""cough"" but U is excluded.

I think we have to consider that the word might be ""cloy"" but that's 4 letters.

Or ""crock"" but R is excluded.

Let's list all 5-letter words starting with C, third letter O, and containing L, and not containing R,A,N,E,U,D.

And L must be in the word.

Possible words:
- ""chill"" -> C H I L L, but position 3 is I, not O. So not.
- ""chomp"" -> C H O M P, no L.
- ""chord"" -> C H O R D, R and D excluded.
- ""chose"" -> C H O S E, E excluded.
- ""close"" -> C L O S E, E excluded, and L in position 2 which is invalid (we know L is not in position 2).
- ""cloy"" -> 4 letters.
- ""crock"" -> R excluded.
- ""croup"" -> C R O U P, R and U excluded.
- ""crown"" -> R and N excluded.
- ""crown"" is 5 but R and N excluded.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

""block"" is B L O C K, but first letter is B, not C.

We need C first.

""clomp"" is C L O M P, but L in position 2, which we know is wrong.

""clomp"" has L in position 2, which we know is not possible because from ""cloud"" feedback, L is not in position 2.

So we cannot use ""clomp"" because it has L in position 2.

Similarly, ""chomp"" has no L.

We need a word that has L in position 4 or 5.

Let's try L in position 4: C ? O L ?

With ? not excluded.

Possible:
- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""col"" is not 5.
- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A excluded and position 3 is L.

I think there is no common word with C _ O L _.

What about ""comet"" -> C O M E T, but E is excluded and position 3 is M, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So let's try L in position 5: C ? O ? L

Then the word is C, ?, O, ?, L

Position 2 and 4 are unknown.

Words:
- ""close"": C L O S E -> but E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.
- ""cable"": A and E excluded.
- ""civic"": C I V I C -> position 3 is V, not O.
- ""cough"": U excluded.
- ""could"": U and D excluded.
- ""chill"": C H I L L -> position 3 is I, not O.
- ""chomp"": no L.
- ""chord"": R and D excluded.
- ""chose"": E excluded.
- ""close"" is the only common one, but E excluded.

But there is ""cloy"" but 4 letters.

Another: ""crock"" is out.

Perhaps ""croup"" is out.

I think we might have to consider that the word is ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters, so not.

Or ""bloat"" but first letter B.

We need to use a word that has L in position 4 or 5, and uses available letters.

Let's try to use a word that has L in position 4: but I can't find one.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5 letters.

I recall that ""colly"" is not, but position 3 is L.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is 5 but position 3 is L.

Perhaps ""cooly"" -> C O O L Y -> but position 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is O, which is good, and position 4 is L.

But position 2 is O. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if O is repeated.

In ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we put O in position 2, it might be correct or not.

Also, we have L in position 4.

And the word has O repeated? But that's possible.

Now, check excluded: O is not excluded, L is in the word, and Y is not excluded.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.

O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a valid word: C O O L Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

Also, position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

So let's consider ""cooly"".

But we have two O's? The word ""cooly"" has two O's.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, but if there is another O, it might be marked as present or not? The feedback only marks each letter individually.

In ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and if there is another O in the word, but in ""cloud"" we only have one O, so if the word has two O's, then the O in position 3 is correct, and if we don't have another O in the guess, we don't know.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

So if we guess ""cooly"", we can test if there is an O in position 2.

Also, we test L in position 4.

And Y in position 5.

But we have to avoid excluded letters: O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But let's see if it fits the known information.

If the secret word is ""cooly"", then:
- Position 1: C ✓
- Position 2: O ? 
- Position 3: O ✓ (we know)
- Position 4: L ? 
- Position 5: Y ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

In ""cooly"", position 2 is O, position 3 is O.

But we don't know if the word has two O's.

Another candidate: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.

""cooly"" is 5 letters.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cough"" excluded U.

""could"" excluded U and D.

""close"" excluded E.

""chill"" excluded I? Not, position 3 is I.

We need position 3 to be O.

So ""cooly"" seems a possibility.

But we have to test if L is in position 4.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is L, not O. So not.

""colza"" is C O L Z A, position 3 is L.

Not.

So ""cooly"" is a candidate.

But in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which we don't know about.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Another 5-letter word: ""coyly"" -> C O Y L Y, position 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is Y, not O. So not.

""cooly"" is the best so far.

But let's confirm the pattern: C O O L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y

But position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.

But we don't know if position 2 is O.

In the feedback for ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, and we have O in position 3 correct.

If the word is ""cooly"", then in ""cloud"", we had L in position 2, but in ""cooly"", L is in position 4, so that matches the feedback: L is in the word but not in position 2.

Also, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which is not tested in ""cloud"" because ""cloud"" had O in position 3.

So it's possible.

But we have to test.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not 5.

""folly"" is F O L L Y, but first letter F.

We need C first.

""cloy"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is considered 5? No, it's 4.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid option.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cable"" is out.

""comply"" is 6.

""close"" is out.

""chase"" -> C H A S E, A and E excluded.

""chime"" -> C H I M E, E excluded.

""shine"" -> S H I N E, not C.

I think it's hard.

Another word: ""civic"" is not.

Perhaps ""coyly"" but position 3 is Y, not O.

I think ""cooly"" is a good guess.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

But we know position 3 is O, so if we guess ""cooly"", and if position 2 is O, it might be correct or not.

But we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to test if O is repeated.

For example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.

""colly"" has position 3 as L.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"" or similar.

But let's think of other words.

What about ""crock"" but R excluded.

""block"" not C.

Another idea: ""chomp"" has no L.

We need to include L.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5.

I recall ""cooly"" is a word.

Or ""cloy"" is not.

Another word: ""cable"" is excluded.

""cabal"" has A and position 3 is A, not O.

I think we have to use ""cooly"" or a similar word.

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2.

We can also try ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think ""cooly"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

I think it's rare.

Another word: ""cavil"" -> C A V I L, A excluded, position 3 is V.

Not.

So I think ""cooly"" is a reasonable guess.

But we have to avoid U and D, which we are.

So let's go with ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.

We can also test other letters.

But we know position 3 is O, so we don't need to test position 3 again.

We need to test position 2 and the other positions.

In ""cooly"", we test:
- Position 1: C (should be ✓)
- Position 2: O (we don't know, could be correct or not)
- Position 3: O (✓)
- Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)
- Position 5: Y

If we get feedback that position 2 is O, then we know position 2 is O, and position 4 L? But if position 2 is O, then position 4 might be L or not.

But we are testing.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word with L in position 4 and a vowel in position 2.

For example, ""chol"" not.

""colza"" has position 3 as L.

Not.

""comol"" not.

I think we have to go with ""cooly"".

But we have another option: we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.

For example, ""cymol"" not a word.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""cavil"" not.

Perhaps ""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the best bet.

But let's consider ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.

I think we have to use ""cooly"".

But in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2, which might be redundant if the word doesn't have two O's.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""cloy"" is not.

Perhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.

I think we should go with ""cooly"".

But let's think of ""colly"" but position 3 is L.

I think we have to accept that.

So for the third guess, I'll go with ""cooly"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""cooly"", then:
- C: ✓
- O: ✓ (position 3)
- O: ? in position 2, if it's O, then ✓, else if it's not, then x or -.
- L: if in position 4, then ✓, else if L is in position 5, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But if L is in position 5, then in ""cooly"" position 4 is L, but if the word has L in position 5, then position 4 L would be marked as absent? Or if the word has only one L, then position 4 L would be x if L is in position 5.

Let's simulate:

Suppose secret word is ""cooly"":
- Guess: C O O L Y
- Position 1: C = ✓
- Position 2: O = ✓ (if the secret has O in position 2, then ✓, else if O is only in position 3, then it might be x or -)
- Position 3: O = ✓
- Position 4: L = ✓ if L is in position 4, else if L is in position 5, then it would be - (because L is in the word but not in position 4, since it's in position 5)
- Position 5: Y = ?

But we don't know if O is in position 2.

Perhaps we can choose a word that doesn't have O in position 2 to avoid confusion.

For example, a word with L in position 4: but we can't find one.

What about ""chol"" is not 5.

I think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.

For example, ""cymol"" not.

""cycol"" not.

""canol"" not.

""cowly"" not.

I think ""cooly"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.

So I'll go with that.

But let's see if there is ""colly"", but position 3 is L.

Not.

Another word: ""comply"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is the best.

So third guess: ""cooly""

But let's confirm the letters: C, O, O, L, Y

O is repeated, but that's okay.

We can also consider ""cloy"" but it's 4 letters.

Or ""cloying"" is 6.

I think ""cooly"" is 5.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - This indicates that the first letter is **C**, and the letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
  - This confirms the first letter is **C** and the third letter is **O**. The letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2. The letters U and D are **not** in the word. Additionally, from guess 1, R, A, N, E, U, and D are now excluded.

**Known information:**
- The word starts with **C** and has **O** in the third position: **C _ O _ _**
- **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D**.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for the third guess:**
- We need to test the position of **L** (position 4 or 5) and gather information about the other positions.
- Since we cannot find a common word with **L** in position 4 (due to constraints), we prioritize testing **L** in position 5 and introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 4.
- The word **""cooly""** fits the pattern: **C _ O _ L**. It tests:
  - **C** in position 1 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 3 (should be ✓).
  - **O** in position 2 (tests if **O** is repeated).
  - **L** in position 4 (tests if **L** is in position 4 or 5).
  - **Y** in position 5 (tests a new letter).
- This guess uses available letters, avoids exclusions, and maximizes information gain.

The letters R, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word starts with \'C\' and does not contain R, A, N, E.\n\nWe need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Starts with \'C\' (since we know the first letter is C)\n- Does not contain R, A, N, E (since they are not in the word)\n- Uses other common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried yet: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has the letter \'C\' in the first position and then uses other common letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- We know the word must start with C and not have R, A, N, E.\n\nLet\'s think of 5-letter words starting with C that avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nSome options:\n- ""CLOUD"": uses C, L, O, U, D -> but we don\'t know if these are in the word.\n- ""CHILL"": has double L, which might not be efficient for getting information.\n- ""CIVIC"": has repeated C and I, but we already know the first letter is C, so we don\'t need to test C again? Actually, we know the first letter is C, but the word might have another C? However, we don\'t have information about other positions.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess only told us about the letters in ""crane"". Since the first letter is C and it\'s correct, we know that the word starts with C. The other letters (R, A, N, E) are absent.\n\nSo, for the second guess, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses other common letters that we haven\'t tested.\n\nLet me list some words starting with C without R, A, N, E:\n\n- ""CLOUD"": C, L, O, U, D\n- ""COULD"": C, O, U, L, D -> same as above but with different order?\n- ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P\n- ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B\n- ""COAST"": but has A (which is excluded) -> not allowed because A is not in the word.\n- ""CROSS"": has R (excluded) and S, S -> but R is excluded.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nAnother idea: ""CLOUD"" is a valid word and uses C, L, O, U, D. All these letters are new.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has any of these. We are trying to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nAnother common starting word is ""SLATE"", but it starts with S, not C. We know the first letter is C, so we can\'t use that.\n\nWe can try ""CHILL"", but it has two L\'s. It might be less informative.\n\nAlternatively, ""CIVIC"" has two C\'s and I\'s. But we know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don\'t know if there is another C. However, we are avoiding R, A, N, E.\n\nBut let\'s think about the feedback: we have only one letter fixed (C in position 1). We need to test other positions.\n\nAnother word: ""COMET"" -> but has E (excluded) and M, O, T.\n\nE is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use R, A, N.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid E and use other vowels? The word must have vowels? The known letters are C (which is a consonant) and we don\'t know about others. But we know the word has at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do.\n\nVowels we haven\'t tried: I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but let\'s avoid for now).\n\nWe can try ""CLOUD"" or ""CHIMP"" or ""CLIMB"".\n\nI think ""CLOUD"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we get to test L, O, U, D.\n\nBut note: the word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has the first letter C and then uses letters that are common and distinct to maximize information.\n\nAnother idea: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D. This is similar to ""CLOUD"" but rearranged.\n\nBut ""CLOUD"" is a common word.\n\nWe can also consider ""CUSHION"", but that has 6 letters? No, 5 letters: C-U-S-H-I-O? 5 letters: C, U, S, H, I? But we need 5 letters.\n\nLet me check: ""CUSHION"" is 6 letters. So not.\n\nAnother 5-letter word: ""CIVIC"" -> but has two C\'s and two I\'s. We know the first letter is C, so if we put C in the first position, then the last letter being C? But we don\'t know if there is another C. Also, we are testing I.\n\nBut we have to avoid R, A, N, E. ""CIVIC"" does not contain these, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, using two C\'s might not be efficient because if we get a feedback for the second C, we might not know if it\'s in the word or not? Actually, the feedback will tell us if the letter is present. But if we use two C\'s, then we are testing the same letter in two positions. If the word has only one C, then one of the C\'s will be marked as absent? But the feedback marks each letter individually.\n\nLet me clarify the rules: for each letter, we get a symbol: \n  - ✓: correct letter and position\n  - -: letter in word but wrong position\n  - x: letter not in word.\n\nSo if we use two C\'s, and the word has only one C (in the first position), then the first C will be ✓ and the second C will be x (because the word only has one C and it\'s already used in the first position). But if the word has two C\'s, then both might be marked appropriately.\n\nHowever, we don\'t know if the word has more than one C. So it might be inefficient.\n\nTherefore, it\'s better to use distinct letters to maximize information.\n\nSo, let\'s avoid repeating letters for now.\n\nBack to ""CLOUD"": C (fixed), L, O, U, D -> all distinct and new.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHIMP"": C, H, I, M, P -> distinct and new.\n\nWe can also consider ""CLIMB"": C, L, I, M, B -> distinct.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""COULD"" -> C, O, U, L, D -> distinct.\n\nI think ""CLOUD"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check if ""CLOUD"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has more vowels? We know the word has at least one vowel (the one in the first position is a consonant, but we don\'t know about others). Actually, we don\'t have information about vowels because we only tested A and E and they were absent. But the word might have I, O, U, or Y.\n\nSo, including a vowel (O or U) is good.\n\n""CLOUD"" has O and U.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""CLOUD"".\n\nBut wait: what about the position of the known letter? We are keeping C in the first position, which is correct.\n\nSo, our second guess: ""CLOUD""\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on L, O, U, D.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position. If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but not in that position. If x, then not in the word.\n\nThis will help us narrow down.\n\nSo, the guess is ""cloud"".\n\nBut note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""cloud"" is a valid English word.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""cloud"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in the first position (✓).\n- R, A, N, and E are not in the word at all (x).\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word starts with ""C"".\n- The word does not contain R, A, N, or E.\n- We need to avoid these letters in our next guess.\n\nFor the second guess, we should:\n- Keep ""C"" in the first position (since it\'s confirmed correct).\n- Use other common letters that haven\'t been tested yet (e.g., L, O, U, D, H, I, M, P, S, T).\n- Prioritize distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid R, A, N, E.\n\nThe word ""cloud"" fits these criteria:\n- Starts with ""C"" (first position fixed).\n- Uses new common letters: L, O, U, D.\n- All letters are distinct.\n- Avoids R, A, N, E.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>cloud</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position, so the first letter is C)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""cloud""\n- C: ✓ (already known first letter, so confirmed)\n- L: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is O)\n- U: x (not in the word)\n- D: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The word starts with C and has O in the third position.\n2. The word contains the letter L, but not in the second position (since in ""cloud"", L was in the second position and got a ""-"", meaning it\'s present but not there).\n3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nAlso, we know the first letter is C, third is O, and the word has an L somewhere (but not in position 2).\n\nSince the word has L and it\'s not in position 2, and we know the positions we have so far: C _ O _ _\n\nWe need to find a word that fits: C _ O _ _ and contains L (but not in position 2) and does not contain R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nAdditionally, we have to avoid these letters.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we want to test possible positions for L and also get information about the other letters.\n\nWe know L is in the word but not in position 2. So it could be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 is already C, so L cannot be in position 1. Therefore, L must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo the word is either: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L\n\nBut we don\'t know which, so we need to test.\n\nWe also need to find the missing letters.\n\nWe have two unknown positions: position 2 and the remaining position (4 or 5, depending on where L is).\n\nWe should choose a word that has the known letters in place: first C, third O, and includes L in either position 4 or 5.\n\nBut we also need to test other common letters for the remaining positions.\n\nWe have to avoid: R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, T, I, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has the form: C _ O L _ or C _ O _ L, and uses new letters to test.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we might choose a word that tests one scenario and also gets information about the other.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L in one of the positions and tests common letters for the others.\n\nLet me list possible words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.\n\nFirst, if L is in position 4: then the word is C _ O L _\n\nPossible words: \n- C O L L Y? But that\'s 5 letters? C, O, L, L, Y? But we have two L\'s? And position 2 would be O? But O is already in position 3, so if we put O in position 2, that would be a different position. But we don\'t know if O is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had O in position 3 correct, but if there were another O, it might have been indicated? In ""cloud"", O was in position 3 and got ✓, and we don\'t have any other O. So it\'s possible the word has only one O.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure.\n\nHowever, we have to consider that the word might have repeated letters, but we haven\'t seen evidence.\n\nLet\'s think of words: C _ O L _\n\nWith the available letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 2: we haven\'t tested many vowels or consonants.\n\nWe know A, E, I, O, U are vowels, but O is already used. E and A are excluded. U is excluded. So vowels left: I, O ( possibly repeated, but we don\'t know). O is already in position 3, so if we use O in position 2, it might be correct or not.\n\nBut we can try.\n\nConsonants for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need common ones.\n\nWords: \n- C O L L Y? But that\'s ""colly"" which is not common. And it has two L\'s. But we don\'t know if L is repeated? The feedback for ""cloud"" had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong position, but if the word has two L\'s, then one L might be in the correct position? But in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. So if the word has two L\'s, then one of them might be in the correct position, but we don\'t have a correct position for L yet.\n\nIn ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", so L is not in position 2, but it is in the word.\n\nNow, if we consider a word with L in position 4: C _ O L _\n\nThen position 2 is a letter that is not L (since L is in 4), and position 5 is another letter.\n\nPossible words: \n- C H O L Y? ""Choly"" is not a word.\n- C O L D S? But D is excluded.\n- C O L M S? ""Colms"" not a word.\n- C O L T S? ""Colds"" is a word: C O L D S -> but D is excluded, so not.\n- C O L L Y? ""Colly"" is a word (informal for coal), but it has two L\'s. And we don\'t know if L is repeated.\n\nBut we can try ""colly"", but it has L in position 2 and 4? In ""colly"": C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y. But in our case, we need position 3 to be O, which it is, but position 2 would be O? That would be a problem because we have O in position 3, but if we put O in position 2, it might be a different O? Or it could be repeated.\n\nBut in the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and U in position 4 wrong. But we don\'t have information about O in other positions.\n\nHowever, we know that the word has at least one O (in position 3). It might have another O? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, for L: we know it\'s in the word but not in position 2. If we use a word with L in position 4, then we can test if L is in position 4.\n\nBut we also need to test position 2 and 5.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5: C _ O _ L\n\nThen the word is C _ O ? L\n\nPossible words: \n- C O V E L? But E is excluded.\n- C O M B L? ""Comb"" is 4 letters, ""Comb"" is 4, not 5.\n- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:L -> but position 3 must be O, not I. So not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O.\n\nSo C _ O _ L\n\nExamples:\n- C O V E L -> but E is excluded.\n- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.\n- C O L L Y? But that has L in position 4 and 5? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O ? L\n\nPossible: \n- C H O P L? Not a word.\n- C R O W L? But R is excluded.\n- C A V I L? A is excluded.\n- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.\n\nActually, ""cable"" is C A B L E, but A and E excluded.\n\nAnother: ""chose"" -> C H O S E, but E is excluded.\n\n""close"" -> C L O S E, but L is in position 2? We need position 3 to be O, so ""close"" is C L O S E -> position 3 is O, but position 2 is L. But we know L is not in position 2? No, we know from ""cloud"" that L is in the word but not in position 2. So in ""close"", if we put L in position 2, it would be wrong because we know L is not in position 2. But we are trying to test L in position 5? No, in this case, for the new guess, we want to test L in position 5.\n\nBut let\'s list words that fit C _ O _ L\n\nWith the blank in position 2 and position 4.\n\nPosition 2: must be a letter not excluded, and not L (since L is in position 5).\n\nExcluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nSo available: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon ones: H, I, M, P, S, T.\n\nNow, position 4: similarly.\n\nPossible words:\n- C H O P L? Not a word.\n- C H O K L? Not a word.\n- C H O Y L? Not a word.\n- C O M B L? Not 5 letters.\n- C O I L L? But that would be C O I L L -> position 3 is I, not O. So not.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with the pattern C _ O _ L.\n\nWhat about ""chose""? But E is excluded.\n\n""close"" has L in position 2, which we know is wrong.\n\nAnother: ""cable"" is excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""coyly""? C O Y L Y -> but position 3 is Y? Not O.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a word with C _ O _ L.\n\nWhat about ""comply""? But that\'s 6 letters.\n\n5-letter words: ""civic"" -> C I V I C, but position 3 is V, not O.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O.\n\nSo let\'s try the other scenario: L in position 4: C _ O L _\n\nThen the word is C ? O L ?\n\nPosition 2 and 5 to fill.\n\nWords: \n- C H O L M? ""Cholm"" not a word.\n- C H O L S? ""Chols"" not a word, but ""chol"" is not 5.\n- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, but we need position 3 to be O. So not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O, so the word is C ? O L ?\n\nSo position 2 and 5.\n\nExamples:\n- C H O L S? Not a word.\n- C O M B L? Not 5.\n- C O I L S? ""Coils"" is C O I L S -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:I, 4:L, 5:S -> but position 3 is I, not O. So not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O, so the third letter must be O.\n\nSo the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for position 3, then L for position 4, then any letter for position 5.\n\nBut is there a word like that?\n\n- C H O L K? Not a word.\n- C O L L Y -> but that has O in position 2 and L in position 3 and 4? C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the positions.\n\nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: O (fixed)\nPosition 4: L (we want to test if L is here)\nPosition 5: ?\n\nBut in the word ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So L is in the word but not in position 2.\n\nIn this new guess, if we put L in position 4, then we can see if it\'s correct or not.\n\nBut we need a valid word.\n\nLet me think of words that start with C, have O in the third position, and contain L.\n\nWe already have C and O fixed.\n\nSo the word is C ? O ? ?\n\nAnd the ? must include L and one other letter.\n\nBut we know L is in the word, so it must be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSo the word is either:\n- C ? O L ?  (L in position 4)\n- C ? O ? L  (L in position 5)\n\nNow, for the second guess, we tested ""cloud"" which is C L O U D, and we got L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, but U and D are absent.\n\nNow, for the third guess, we can try to test L in position 4 and also test other common letters.\n\nBut we need to choose a word that fits one of the patterns.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has L in position 5 to test that scenario.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words.\n\nSince we have limited options, we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.\n\nBut we don\'t know which pattern.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has the known letters and tests common letters for the unknown positions.\n\nWe know C and O are fixed, so we can only change positions 2, 4, 5.\n\nBut we have to include L in either position 4 or 5.\n\nLet me try to find words with C in 1, O in 3, and L in 4: C ? O L ?\n\nPossible words:\n- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.\n- ""colly"" has position 3 as L, not O.\n- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.\n\nI think there are no common words with C _ O L _.\n\nWhat about ""comply"" but that\'s 6 letters.\n\n""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> but position 3 is L, not O. So not.\n\nPerhaps ""chole"" but E is excluded.\n\nI think it\'s more likely that L is in position 5: C ? O ? L\n\nThen the word is C, then any letter (not excluded) for position 2, then O for 3, then L for 5.\n\nSo words: C ? O ? L\n\nExamples:\n- ""close"" -> C L O S E, but E is excluded and L is in position 2, which we know is wrong. Also, E is excluded.\n- ""cable"" -> C A B L E, A and E excluded.\n- ""civic"" -> C I V I C, position 3 is V, not O.\n- ""crock"" -> C R O C K, but R is excluded and position 3 is O? C R O C K -> position 1:C, 2:R (excluded), 3:O, 4:C, 5:K -> but R is excluded, so not.\n- ""cough"" -> C O U G H, but U is excluded.\n- ""could"" -> C O U L D, but U and D are excluded.\n\nAll these have issues.\n\nWhat about ""chose""? C H O S E, but E is excluded.\n\n""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.\n\nAnother: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""cowl"" is 4 letters.\n\nI think we might have to consider that L might be in position 4, but I can\'t find a word.\n\nLet\'s try a different approach: we know L is in the word, so we can try a word that has L in position 4 and a new letter in position 2 and 5.\n\nFor example, ""chol"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""colly"" is not.\n\nWhat about ""colza""? C O L Z A, but A is excluded and position 3 is L.\n\nI think we have to consider that the word might have L in position 5 and use a word that tests that.\n\nSo let\'s try the pattern C ? O ? L\n\nWith ? not in the excluded letters.\n\nPossible letters for position 2: we have many, but not the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nSo position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon: H, I, M, P, S, T.\n\nPosition 5: similarly.\n\nNow, what words are there?\n\n- ""close"": but E is excluded and L is in position 2 which is invalid.\n\n- ""cable"": A and E excluded.\n\n- ""civic"": position 3 is V, not O.\n\nI think we might have to use a word that doesn\'t have L in position 4 or 5? But we know L is in the word, so we must include it.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.\n\n""colly"" is C O L L Y -> but position 3 is L, not O.\n\nAnother idea: ""chose"" is C H O S E, but E is excluded.\n\n""close"" is the only common one, but E is excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""cough"" but U is excluded.\n\nI think we have to consider that the word might be ""cloy"" but that\'s 4 letters.\n\nOr ""crock"" but R is excluded.\n\nLet\'s list all 5-letter words starting with C, third letter O, and containing L, and not containing R,A,N,E,U,D.\n\nAnd L must be in the word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""chill"" -> C H I L L, but position 3 is I, not O. So not.\n- ""chomp"" -> C H O M P, no L.\n- ""chord"" -> C H O R D, R and D excluded.\n- ""chose"" -> C H O S E, E excluded.\n- ""close"" -> C L O S E, E excluded, and L in position 2 which is invalid (we know L is not in position 2).\n- ""cloy"" -> 4 letters.\n- ""crock"" -> R excluded.\n- ""croup"" -> C R O U P, R and U excluded.\n- ""crown"" -> R and N excluded.\n- ""crown"" is 5 but R and N excluded.\n\nAnother: ""crock"" is out.\n\n""block"" is B L O C K, but first letter is B, not C.\n\nWe need C first.\n\n""clomp"" is C L O M P, but L in position 2, which we know is wrong.\n\n""clomp"" has L in position 2, which we know is not possible because from ""cloud"" feedback, L is not in position 2.\n\nSo we cannot use ""clomp"" because it has L in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""chomp"" has no L.\n\nWe need a word that has L in position 4 or 5.\n\nLet\'s try L in position 4: C ? O L ?\n\nWith ? not excluded.\n\nPossible:\n- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.\n- ""col"" is not 5.\n- ""colza"" -> C O L Z A, but A excluded and position 3 is L.\n\nI think there is no common word with C _ O L _.\n\nWhat about ""comet"" -> C O M E T, but E is excluded and position 3 is M, not O.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O.\n\nSo let\'s try L in position 5: C ? O ? L\n\nThen the word is C, ?, O, ?, L\n\nPosition 2 and 4 are unknown.\n\nWords:\n- ""close"": C L O S E -> but E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.\n- ""cable"": A and E excluded.\n- ""civic"": C I V I C -> position 3 is V, not O.\n- ""cough"": U excluded.\n- ""could"": U and D excluded.\n- ""chill"": C H I L L -> position 3 is I, not O.\n- ""chomp"": no L.\n- ""chord"": R and D excluded.\n- ""chose"": E excluded.\n- ""close"" is the only common one, but E excluded.\n\nBut there is ""cloy"" but 4 letters.\n\nAnother: ""crock"" is out.\n\nPerhaps ""croup"" is out.\n\nI think we might have to consider that the word is ""cloy"" but it\'s 4 letters, so not.\n\nOr ""bloat"" but first letter B.\n\nWe need to use a word that has L in position 4 or 5, and uses available letters.\n\nLet\'s try to use a word that has L in position 4: but I can\'t find one.\n\nPerhaps ""chol"" is not 5 letters.\n\nI recall that ""colly"" is not, but position 3 is L.\n\nAnother word: ""comply"" is 6.\n\n""colly"" is 5 but position 3 is L.\n\nPerhaps ""cooly"" -> C O O L Y -> but position 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is O, which is good, and position 4 is L.\n\nBut position 2 is O. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don\'t know if O is repeated.\n\nIn ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.\n\nBut we know position 3 is O, so if we put O in position 2, it might be correct or not.\n\nAlso, we have L in position 4.\n\nAnd the word has O repeated? But that\'s possible.\n\nNow, check excluded: O is not excluded, L is in the word, and Y is not excluded.\n\nExcluded: R, A, N, E, U, D.\n\nO is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.\n\nSo ""cooly"" is a valid word: C O O L Y\n\nBut position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.\n\nAlso, position 2 is O, which we don\'t know about.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""cooly"".\n\nBut we have two O\'s? The word ""cooly"" has two O\'s.\n\nIn the feedback for ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, but if there is another O, it might be marked as present or not? The feedback only marks each letter individually.\n\nIn ""cloud"", we had O in position 3 correct, and if there is another O in the word, but in ""cloud"" we only have one O, so if the word has two O\'s, then the O in position 3 is correct, and if we don\'t have another O in the guess, we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.\n\nSo if we guess ""cooly"", we can test if there is an O in position 2.\n\nAlso, we test L in position 4.\n\nAnd Y in position 5.\n\nBut we have to avoid excluded letters: O is not excluded, L is in the word, Y is not excluded.\n\nSo ""cooly"" is a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see if it fits the known information.\n\nIf the secret word is ""cooly"", then:\n- Position 1: C ✓\n- Position 2: O ? \n- Position 3: O ✓ (we know)\n- Position 4: L ? \n- Position 5: Y ?\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in position 2.\n\nIn ""cooly"", position 2 is O, position 3 is O.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two O\'s.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cloy"" is 4 letters.\n\n""cooly"" is 5 letters.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other words.\n\nAnother word: ""cable"" is excluded.\n\n""cough"" excluded U.\n\n""could"" excluded U and D.\n\n""close"" excluded E.\n\n""chill"" excluded I? Not, position 3 is I.\n\nWe need position 3 to be O.\n\nSo ""cooly"" seems a possibility.\n\nBut we have to test if L is in position 4.\n\nAnother word: ""comply"" is 6.\n\n""colly"" is C O L L Y -> position 1:C, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is L, not O. So not.\n\n""colza"" is C O L Z A, position 3 is L.\n\nNot.\n\nSo ""cooly"" is a candidate.\n\nBut in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which we don\'t know about.\n\nWe can also consider ""cloy"" but it\'s 4 letters.\n\nAnother 5-letter word: ""coyly"" -> C O Y L Y, position 1:C, 2:O, 3:Y, 4:L, 5:Y -> position 3 is Y, not O. So not.\n\n""cooly"" is the best so far.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: C O O L Y -> positions: 1:C, 2:O, 3:O, 4:L, 5:Y\n\nBut position 3 is O, which is correct, and position 4 is L.\n\nBut we don\'t know if position 2 is O.\n\nIn the feedback for ""cloud"", we had L in position 2 marked as present but wrong, and we have O in position 3 correct.\n\nIf the word is ""cooly"", then in ""cloud"", we had L in position 2, but in ""cooly"", L is in position 4, so that matches the feedback: L is in the word but not in position 2.\n\nAlso, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, which is not tested in ""cloud"" because ""cloud"" had O in position 3.\n\nSo it\'s possible.\n\nBut we have to test.\n\nAnother word: ""cloy"" is not 5.\n\n""folly"" is F O L L Y, but first letter F.\n\nWe need C first.\n\n""cloy"" is not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""cloy"" is considered 5? No, it\'s 4.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is a valid option.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with L in position 5.\n\nFor example, ""cable"" is out.\n\n""comply"" is 6.\n\n""close"" is out.\n\n""chase"" -> C H A S E, A and E excluded.\n\n""chime"" -> C H I M E, E excluded.\n\n""shine"" -> S H I N E, not C.\n\nI think it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""civic"" is not.\n\nPerhaps ""coyly"" but position 3 is Y, not O.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is a good guess.\n\nBut in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.\n\nBut we know position 3 is O, so if we guess ""cooly"", and if position 2 is O, it might be correct or not.\n\nBut we can get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have O in position 2 to test if O is repeated.\n\nFor example, ""comply"" is 6 letters.\n\n""colly"" has position 3 as L.\n\nI think we have to go with ""cooly"" or similar.\n\nBut let\'s think of other words.\n\nWhat about ""crock"" but R excluded.\n\n""block"" not C.\n\nAnother idea: ""chomp"" has no L.\n\nWe need to include L.\n\nPerhaps ""cloy"" is not 5.\n\nI recall ""cooly"" is a word.\n\nOr ""cloy"" is not.\n\nAnother word: ""cable"" is excluded.\n\n""cabal"" has A and position 3 is A, not O.\n\nI think we have to use ""cooly"" or a similar word.\n\nBut in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2.\n\nWe can also try ""chol"" is not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with L in position 5.\n\nFor example, ""cymol"" not a word.\n\n""cycol"" not.\n\nI think it\'s rare.\n\nAnother word: ""cavil"" -> C A V I L, A excluded, position 3 is V.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think ""cooly"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut we have to avoid U and D, which we are.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""cooly"".\n\nBut in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2 and 3.\n\nWe can also test other letters.\n\nBut we know position 3 is O, so we don\'t need to test position 3 again.\n\nWe need to test position 2 and the other positions.\n\nIn ""cooly"", we test:\n- Position 1: C (should be ✓)\n- Position 2: O (we don\'t know, could be correct or not)\n- Position 3: O (✓)\n- Position 4: L (we want to test if L is here)\n- Position 5: Y\n\nIf we get feedback that position 2 is O, then we know position 2 is O, and position 4 L? But if position 2 is O, then position 4 might be L or not.\n\nBut we are testing.\n\nAnother word: ""cloy"" is not.\n\nPerhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with L in position 4 and a vowel in position 2.\n\nFor example, ""chol"" not.\n\n""colza"" has position 3 as L.\n\nNot.\n\n""comol"" not.\n\nI think we have to go with ""cooly"".\n\nBut we have another option: we can try a word that has L in position 5 and a different letter in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""cymol"" not a word.\n\n""cycol"" not.\n\n""canol"" not.\n\nI think it\'s difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""cavil"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""cowly"" not.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is the best bet.\n\nBut let\'s consider ""chol"" is not 5.\n\nPerhaps ""chole"" is 5 but E excluded.\n\nI think we have to use ""cooly"".\n\nBut in ""cooly"", we have O in position 2, which might be redundant if the word doesn\'t have two O\'s.\n\nBut it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother word: ""cloy"" is not.\n\nPerhaps ""cloy"" is not 5, but ""cloying"" is 6.\n\nI think we should go with ""cooly"".\n\nBut let\'s think of ""colly"" but position 3 is L.\n\nI think we have to accept that.\n\nSo for the third guess, I\'ll go with ""cooly"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""cooly"", then:\n- C: ✓\n- O: ✓ (position 3)\n- O: ? in position 2, if it\'s O, then ✓, else if it\'s not, then x or -.\n- L: if in position 4, then ✓, else if L is in position 5, then it would be marked as present but wrong position? But if L is in position 5, then in ""cooly"" position 4 is L, but if the word has L in position 5, then position 4 L would be marked as absent? Or if the word has only one L, then position 4 L would be x if L is in position 5.\n\nLet\'s simulate:\n\nSuppose secret word is ""cooly"":\n- Guess: C O O L Y\n- Position 1: C = ✓\n- Position 2: O = ✓ (if the secret has O in position 2, then ✓, else if O is only in position 3, then it might be x or -)\n- Position 3: O = ✓\n- Position 4: L = ✓ if L is in position 4, else if L is in position 5, then it would be - (because L is in the word but not in position 4, since it\'s in position 5)\n- Position 5: Y = ?\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in position 2.\n\nPerhaps we can choose a word that doesn\'t have O in position 2 to avoid confusion.\n\nFor example, a word with L in position 4: but we can\'t find one.\n\nWhat about ""chol"" is not 5.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has L in position 5.\n\nFor example, ""cymol"" not.\n\n""cycol"" not.\n\n""canol"" not.\n\n""cowly"" not.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is the only common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is ""colly"", but position 3 is L.\n\nNot.\n\nAnother word: ""comply"" is 6.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is the best.\n\nSo third guess: ""cooly""\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: C, O, O, L, Y\n\nO is repeated, but that\'s okay.\n\nWe can also consider ""cloy"" but it\'s 4 letters.\n\nOr ""cloying"" is 6.\n\nI think ""cooly"" is 5.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - This indicates that the first letter is **C**, and the letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  \n  - This confirms the first letter is **C** and the third letter is **O**. The letter **L** is in the word but not in position 2. The letters U and D are **not** in the word. Additionally, from guess 1, R, A, N, E, U, and D are now excluded.\n\n**Known information:**\n- The word starts with **C** and has **O** in the third position: **C _ O _ _**\n- **L** is in the word but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 4 or 5).\n- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D**.\n- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n**Strategy for the third guess:**\n- We need to test the position of **L** (position 4 or 5) and gather information about the other positions.\n- Since we cannot find a common word with **L** in position 4 (due to constraints), we prioritize testing **L** in position 5 and introduce new common letters for positions 2 and 4.\n- The word **""cooly""** fits the pattern: **C _ O _ L**. It tests:\n  - **C** in position 1 (should be ✓).\n  - **O** in position 3 (should be ✓).\n  - **O** in position 2 (tests if **O** is repeated).\n  - **L** in position 4 (tests if **L** is in position 4 or 5).\n  - **Y** in position 5 (tests a new letter).\n- This guess uses available letters, avoids exclusions, and maximizes information gain.\n\n<guess>cooly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: cloud -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: cooly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>

- First letter is C (correct).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
- C is correct in position 1 (already known).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"").
- O is correct in position 3 (so the third letter is O).
- U and D are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""cooly"" → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x)
- C is correct in position 1 (known).
- The first O (position 2) got ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. But we already know O is in position 3, so this confirms there's only one O? Not necessarily, but it means the O in position 2 is incorrect, so the word has O only in position 3.
- The second O (position 3) got ""✓"", which we expected.
- L is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is L).
- Y is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word is: C _ O L _ 
   - Position 1: C
   - Position 3: O
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

2. Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y (from the ""x"" marks in all guesses).
3. We know L is in position 4 (from ""cooly"" feedback: L(✓)).
4. The first O was marked as ""-"" in position 2, meaning:
   - There is an O in the word, but it's not in position 2.
   - Since we know O is in position 3, this confirms there's only one O (because if there were two O's, the first O in ""cooly"" might have been marked differently? But the feedback only marks the letters individually. The first O (position 2) was marked as ""-"", meaning the letter O is in the word but not in position 2. Since we have O in position 3, which is correct, and the word has only one O? Not necessarily, but it's possible that there is only one O. However, we cannot rule out two O's, but the feedback for the first O in ""cooly"" being ""-"" means that position 2 is not O, and since position 3 is O, if there were a second O, it might be marked separately, but in ""cooly"", we only have one O (in position 2 and 3). The feedback for position 2 O was ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2, which is consistent with position 3 O. But if there were a second O, say in position 5, it wouldn't be marked in this guess because we didn't test it. But in the feedback, we only see the marks for the letters we guessed.

However, in ""cooly"", we guessed O in position 2 and it was marked as ""-"", which tells us that the O in position 2 is incorrect, and since position 3 is correct, the O in position 2 is not present in the word? Not exactly. The feedback says the letter is in the word but wrong position, so there is an O in the word, but not in position 2. But it could be in another position. Since position 3 is O and correct, and position 2 is not O, the O must be in position 3 or elsewhere. But we have only one O in the guess, so if there were a second O, we wouldn't know. But in the feedback, for position 2, it's marked as ""-"", meaning that the letter O is present but not in position 2. This doesn't tell us if there is another O. It only says that position 2 is not O.

So it's possible the word has two O's? But we don't have evidence.

From the feedback, we know:
- Position 2: not O (because of ""-"" for O in position 2 in ""cooly"").
- Position 3: O (correct).
- The word has O, and it's in position 3, so if there is a second O, it could be in position 5 (since position 2 is not O).

But we don't know.

Similarly, for L: in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. Now in ""cooly"", L is in position 4 and got ""✓"", so position 4 is L. So L is fixed in position 4.

Now, position 5: we don't know.

Also, position 2: we don't know.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z (and O is in, but we know its position).

But O is already placed.

Now, the word is C ? O L ?

Position 2 and 5 to fill.

We know position 2 cannot be O (from ""cooly"" feedback), and cannot be any excluded letter.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be excluded letters.

Now, what letters can be in position 2 and 5?

Position 2: must be a letter not excluded and not L (since L is in position 4). But it could be O? But position 2 cannot be O because of the feedback from ""cooly"": the first O (position 2) was marked as ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2. So position 2 is not O. Also, from previous, position 2 is not R,A,N,E,U,D,Y (excluded).

So position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

But it must form a valid English word.

Similarly, position 5: same available letters, but must be a letter that can form a word.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits C ? O L ? and uses available letters.

Possible words:

- Position 5: must be a letter not excluded.

Let's list possible words:

- If position 5 is H: C ? O L H → ""cholh"" not a word.
- I: C H O L I → ""choli"" (which is a word, meaning a type of cloth or a biological term) or ""chola"" (a city in Spain) — but ""chola"" might be proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are not used, so we need common words.

""choli"" is a word.

- Other possibilities: C H O L M → not a word, ""cholm"" not common.
- C H O L S → ""chols"" not a word.
- C M O L H? Not a word.
- C H O L K → ""cholk"" not a word.
- C H O L Y → but Y is excluded? In guess 3, Y is marked as ""x"", so Y is not in the word. So position 5 cannot be Y.

Y is excluded now.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y.

So position 5 cannot be Y.

Available for position 5: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""choli"": C H O L I → this might work. ""Choli"" is a word (noun or adjective).

- ""chola"": C H O L A → but A is excluded.

A is excluded.

- ""chom"" not a word.

- ""chopp"" not.

- ""chits"" → C H I T S, but position 3 is I, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So ""choli"" seems a possibility: C H O L I

But position 5 is I.

Is ""choli"" a word? It might be accepted as an adjective or noun, but let's see.

Another word: ""chola"" but A excluded.

""chomp"" has no L.

We need L in position 4.

""chomp"" is C H O M P, no L.

""chord"" has R and D excluded.

""chirp"" no L.

What about ""chole"" but E excluded.

I think ""choli"" is a candidate.

But let's see if there is ""chol"" something.

Another word: ""cholm"" not.

""choly"" → C H O L Y, but Y is excluded.

""chomp"" not.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5.

What about ""comol"" not.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word I can think of.

But let's check: C H O L I → positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:I.

This fits: C ? O L ? with ? being H and I.

H and I are not excluded.

I is not excluded.

Also, Y is excluded, so position 5 cannot be Y.

In ""choli"", position 5 is I, which is not excluded.

Similarly, position 2: H, not excluded.

So ""choli"" is a candidate.

But is ""choli"" a valid word? It might be accepted as an abbreviation or in some dictionaries as an adjective, but let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""chola"" but A excluded.

""cholo"" → C H O L O → but position 5 is O. Is that possible? The word would be C H O L O.

But position 5 is O.

Now, is ""cholo"" a word? I think it might be a variant or not common.

""choli"" is better.

""cholm"" not.

""chomp"" not.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5.

What about ""chol"" with a suffix? Not.

I think ""choli"" is the best.

But let's see if L is in position 5.

Another pattern: C ? O ? L

But we tried that and couldn't find words.

For example, ""close"" has E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.

""chase"" A and E excluded.

""chime"" E excluded.

""shine"" not C.

I think it's not possible.

So the only possibility is L in position 4: C ? O L ?

And we have ""choli"" as a candidate.

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H and position 5 is I.

We can test H and I.

But we also need to confirm if the word has only one O? In ""choli"", there is only one O.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chol"" with a different ending.

I think ""choli"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is ""comol"" or something.

""comet"" has E and position 3 M.

Not.

I think we have to go with ""choli"".

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H, which we haven't tested.

Position 5 is I.

If we guess ""choli"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback.

But we might have other options.

What about ""chol"" with a Y? But Y excluded.

""choly"" has Y excluded.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word.

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chol"" with a suffix.

I think we should guess ""choli"".

But let's see if there is ""chol"" with different letters.

For example, ""chol"" and then what? Not.

""chol"" is not 5.

I think we have to use ""choli"".

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H, which we haven't tested.

Position 5 is I.

We can also consider ""chomp"" but no L.

We must have L in position 4.

So I think ""choli"" is the word.

But let's double-check the feedback.

If the secret word is ""choli"", then:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → correct because C is first, R not in, A not, etc.
- Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) → correct: L is in word but not position 2 (it's in position 4 of ""choli"", so ""-"" is correct), O is ✓, U and D not in.
- Guess 3: ""cooly"" → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x) → O in position 2 is ""-"", which is correct because position 2 is not O (it's H), and O in position 3 is ✓, L in position 4 is ✓, Y not in.

Perfect.

So the secret word should be ""choli"".

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the answer.

We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

Since we are at guess 4, and we have this candidate, we can guess it.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word has two O's? For example, ""cooly"" we guessed, but ""cooly"" has two O's, and in ""cooly"", position 2 O was marked as ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2. If the word were ""cooly"", then position 2 O would be correct? No, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, and it should be ✓ if it were correct, but it was ""-"", so it's not position 2. But if the word has two O's, one in position 3 and another, say in position 5, then when we guessed O in position 2, it should be marked as ""-"" only if there is an O in the word but not in position 2, which is true, but it doesn't tell us about position 5. But in ""cooly"", position 5 is Y, which is excluded and not O.

If the word had O in position 5, then in ""cooly"", position 5 Y would be wrong, but O in position 5 would be untested.

But in ""cooly"", we didn't test O in position 5.

But for ""choli"", position 5 is I.

So back to ""choli"".

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Or ""chol"" with a different letter.

I think ""choli"" is the word.

So for the fourth guess, I'll guess ""choli"".

But let's confirm the pattern: C H O L I

Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: O
Position 4: L
Position 5: I

All letters: C, H, O, L, I — O and L are already known to be in the word, C and O are fixed, L is fixed in position 4.

H and I are new.

And H and I are not excluded.

So it should be valid.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5, but ""choli"" is 5.

I think it's the word.

But we have to be cautious.

Another possibility: what if the word is ""comply""? But 6 letters.

No.

Or ""civic"" has I, but position 3 is I, not O.

Not.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word that fits.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - Confirms **C** is the first letter.  
  - Letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
  - Confirms **C** and **O** (position 3) are correct.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - Letters U and D are **not** in the word.  
  - Excludes U, D.  

- **Guess 3: cooly** → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x)  
  - Confirms **C** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **L** (position 4) are correct.  
  - The first **O** (position 2) is marked as ""-"", meaning **O** is in the word but not in position 2 (and since position 3 is confirmed, this suggests the word has only one **O**).  
  - Y is **not** in the word.  
  - Excludes Y.  

**Current knowledge:**  
- The word is **C _ O L _** (positions: 1=C, 3=O, 4=L).  
- Position 2 and 5 are unknown.  
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D, Y**.  
- Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  

**Strategy for guess 4:**  
- We need to solve for position 2 and position 5.  
- The word **""choli""** (C H O L I) fits the pattern:  
  - Position 1: **C** (✓).

  - Position 2: **H** (tests a new letter).

  - Position 3: **O** (✓).

  - Position 4: **L** (✓).

  - Position 5: **I** (tests a new letter).

- **H** and **I** are not excluded, making this a valid guess.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle. If not, the feedback will reveal more about positions 2 and 5.  

<guess>choli</guess>",choli,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
- First letter is C (correct).
- R, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
- C is correct in position 1 (already known).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (since it got ""-"").
- O is correct in position 3 (so the third letter is O).
- U and D are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""cooly"" → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x)
- C is correct in position 1 (known).
- The first O (position 2) got ""-"", meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. But we already know O is in position 3, so this confirms there's only one O? Not necessarily, but it means the O in position 2 is incorrect, so the word has O only in position 3.
- The second O (position 3) got ""✓"", which we expected.
- L is correct in position 4 (so the fourth letter is L).
- Y is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The word is: C _ O L _ 
   - Position 1: C
   - Position 3: O
   - Position 4: L
   - Position 2 and 5 are unknown.

2. Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y (from the ""x"" marks in all guesses).
3. We know L is in position 4 (from ""cooly"" feedback: L(✓)).
4. The first O was marked as ""-"" in position 2, meaning:
   - There is an O in the word, but it's not in position 2.
   - Since we know O is in position 3, this confirms there's only one O (because if there were two O's, the first O in ""cooly"" might have been marked differently? But the feedback only marks the letters individually. The first O (position 2) was marked as ""-"", meaning the letter O is in the word but not in position 2. Since we have O in position 3, which is correct, and the word has only one O? Not necessarily, but it's possible that there is only one O. However, we cannot rule out two O's, but the feedback for the first O in ""cooly"" being ""-"" means that position 2 is not O, and since position 3 is O, if there were a second O, it might be marked separately, but in ""cooly"", we only have one O (in position 2 and 3). The feedback for position 2 O was ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2, which is consistent with position 3 O. But if there were a second O, say in position 5, it wouldn't be marked in this guess because we didn't test it. But in the feedback, we only see the marks for the letters we guessed.

However, in ""cooly"", we guessed O in position 2 and it was marked as ""-"", which tells us that the O in position 2 is incorrect, and since position 3 is correct, the O in position 2 is not present in the word? Not exactly. The feedback says the letter is in the word but wrong position, so there is an O in the word, but not in position 2. But it could be in another position. Since position 3 is O and correct, and position 2 is not O, the O must be in position 3 or elsewhere. But we have only one O in the guess, so if there were a second O, we wouldn't know. But in the feedback, for position 2, it's marked as ""-"", meaning that the letter O is present but not in position 2. This doesn't tell us if there is another O. It only says that position 2 is not O.

So it's possible the word has two O's? But we don't have evidence.

From the feedback, we know:
- Position 2: not O (because of ""-"" for O in position 2 in ""cooly"").
- Position 3: O (correct).
- The word has O, and it's in position 3, so if there is a second O, it could be in position 5 (since position 2 is not O).

But we don't know.

Similarly, for L: in ""cloud"", L was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. Now in ""cooly"", L is in position 4 and got ""✓"", so position 4 is L. So L is fixed in position 4.

Now, position 5: we don't know.

Also, position 2: we don't know.

Excluded letters: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y.

So available letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z (and O is in, but we know its position).

But O is already placed.

Now, the word is C ? O L ?

Position 2 and 5 to fill.

We know position 2 cannot be O (from ""cooly"" feedback), and cannot be any excluded letter.

Similarly, position 5 cannot be excluded letters.

Now, what letters can be in position 2 and 5?

Position 2: must be a letter not excluded and not L (since L is in position 4). But it could be O? But position 2 cannot be O because of the feedback from ""cooly"": the first O (position 2) was marked as ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2. So position 2 is not O. Also, from previous, position 2 is not R,A,N,E,U,D,Y (excluded).

So position 2 can be: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

But it must form a valid English word.

Similarly, position 5: same available letters, but must be a letter that can form a word.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits C ? O L ? and uses available letters.

Possible words:

- Position 5: must be a letter not excluded.

Let's list possible words:

- If position 5 is H: C ? O L H → ""cholh"" not a word.
- I: C H O L I → ""choli"" (which is a word, meaning a type of cloth or a biological term) or ""chola"" (a city in Spain) — but ""chola"" might be proper noun? In Wordle, proper nouns are not used, so we need common words.

""choli"" is a word.

- Other possibilities: C H O L M → not a word, ""cholm"" not common.
- C H O L S → ""chols"" not a word.
- C M O L H? Not a word.
- C H O L K → ""cholk"" not a word.
- C H O L Y → but Y is excluded? In guess 3, Y is marked as ""x"", so Y is not in the word. So position 5 cannot be Y.

Y is excluded now.

Excluded: R, A, N, E, U, D, Y.

So position 5 cannot be Y.

Available for position 5: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.

Now, common words:

- ""chol"" is not 5 letters.
- ""choli"": C H O L I → this might work. ""Choli"" is a word (noun or adjective).

- ""chola"": C H O L A → but A is excluded.

A is excluded.

- ""chom"" not a word.

- ""chopp"" not.

- ""chits"" → C H I T S, but position 3 is I, not O.

We need position 3 to be O.

So ""choli"" seems a possibility: C H O L I

But position 5 is I.

Is ""choli"" a word? It might be accepted as an adjective or noun, but let's see.

Another word: ""chola"" but A excluded.

""chomp"" has no L.

We need L in position 4.

""chomp"" is C H O M P, no L.

""chord"" has R and D excluded.

""chirp"" no L.

What about ""chole"" but E excluded.

I think ""choli"" is a candidate.

But let's see if there is ""chol"" something.

Another word: ""cholm"" not.

""choly"" → C H O L Y, but Y is excluded.

""chomp"" not.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5.

What about ""comol"" not.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word I can think of.

But let's check: C H O L I → positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:O, 4:L, 5:I.

This fits: C ? O L ? with ? being H and I.

H and I are not excluded.

I is not excluded.

Also, Y is excluded, so position 5 cannot be Y.

In ""choli"", position 5 is I, which is not excluded.

Similarly, position 2: H, not excluded.

So ""choli"" is a candidate.

But is ""choli"" a valid word? It might be accepted as an abbreviation or in some dictionaries as an adjective, but let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""chola"" but A excluded.

""cholo"" → C H O L O → but position 5 is O. Is that possible? The word would be C H O L O.

But position 5 is O.

Now, is ""cholo"" a word? I think it might be a variant or not common.

""choli"" is better.

""cholm"" not.

""chomp"" not.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5.

What about ""chol"" with a suffix? Not.

I think ""choli"" is the best.

But let's see if L is in position 5.

Another pattern: C ? O ? L

But we tried that and couldn't find words.

For example, ""close"" has E excluded and L in position 2 invalid.

""chase"" A and E excluded.

""chime"" E excluded.

""shine"" not C.

I think it's not possible.

So the only possibility is L in position 4: C ? O L ?

And we have ""choli"" as a candidate.

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H and position 5 is I.

We can test H and I.

But we also need to confirm if the word has only one O? In ""choli"", there is only one O.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chol"" with a different ending.

I think ""choli"" is acceptable.

But let's see if there is ""comol"" or something.

""comet"" has E and position 3 M.

Not.

I think we have to go with ""choli"".

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H, which we haven't tested.

Position 5 is I.

If we guess ""choli"", and if it's not the word, we get feedback.

But we might have other options.

What about ""chol"" with a Y? But Y excluded.

""choly"" has Y excluded.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word.

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Perhaps ""chol"" with a suffix.

I think we should guess ""choli"".

But let's see if there is ""chol"" with different letters.

For example, ""chol"" and then what? Not.

""chol"" is not 5.

I think we have to use ""choli"".

But in ""choli"", position 2 is H, which we haven't tested.

Position 5 is I.

We can also consider ""chomp"" but no L.

We must have L in position 4.

So I think ""choli"" is the word.

But let's double-check the feedback.

If the secret word is ""choli"", then:

- Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → correct because C is first, R not in, A not, etc.
- Guess 2: ""cloud"" → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x) → correct: L is in word but not position 2 (it's in position 4 of ""choli"", so ""-"" is correct), O is ✓, U and D not in.
- Guess 3: ""cooly"" → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x) → O in position 2 is ""-"", which is correct because position 2 is not O (it's H), and O in position 3 is ✓, L in position 4 is ✓, Y not in.

Perfect.

So the secret word should be ""choli"".

But we are to make a guess, not necessarily the answer.

We have to guess a word that fits the pattern.

Since we are at guess 4, and we have this candidate, we can guess it.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word has two O's? For example, ""cooly"" we guessed, but ""cooly"" has two O's, and in ""cooly"", position 2 O was marked as ""-"", meaning that O is in the word but not in position 2. If the word were ""cooly"", then position 2 O would be correct? No, in ""cooly"", position 2 is O, and it should be ✓ if it were correct, but it was ""-"", so it's not position 2. But if the word has two O's, one in position 3 and another, say in position 5, then when we guessed O in position 2, it should be marked as ""-"" only if there is an O in the word but not in position 2, which is true, but it doesn't tell us about position 5. But in ""cooly"", position 5 is Y, which is excluded and not O.

If the word had O in position 5, then in ""cooly"", position 5 Y would be wrong, but O in position 5 would be untested.

But in ""cooly"", we didn't test O in position 5.

But for ""choli"", position 5 is I.

So back to ""choli"".

Another word: ""chol"" is not 5.

Or ""chol"" with a different letter.

I think ""choli"" is the word.

So for the fourth guess, I'll guess ""choli"".

But let's confirm the pattern: C H O L I

Position 1: C
Position 2: H
Position 3: O
Position 4: L
Position 5: I

All letters: C, H, O, L, I — O and L are already known to be in the word, C and O are fixed, L is fixed in position 4.

H and I are new.

And H and I are not excluded.

So it should be valid.

Perhaps ""chol"" is not 5, but ""choli"" is 5.

I think it's the word.

But we have to be cautious.

Another possibility: what if the word is ""comply""? But 6 letters.

No.

Or ""civic"" has I, but position 3 is I, not O.

Not.

I think ""choli"" is the only common word that fits.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - Confirms **C** is the first letter.  
  - Letters R, A, N, E are **not** in the word.  

- **Guess 2: cloud** → C(✓) L(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
  - Confirms **C** and **O** (position 3) are correct.  
  - **L** is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - Letters U and D are **not** in the word.  
  - Excludes U, D.  

- **Guess 3: cooly** → C(✓) O(-) O(✓) L(✓) Y(x)  
  - Confirms **C** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **L** (position 4) are correct.  
  - The first **O** (position 2) is marked as ""-"", meaning **O** is in the word but not in position 2 (and since position 3 is confirmed, this suggests the word has only one **O**).  
  - Y is **not** in the word.  
  - Excludes Y.  

**Current knowledge:**  
- The word is **C _ O L _** (positions: 1=C, 3=O, 4=L).  
- Position 2 and 5 are unknown.  
- Excluded letters: **R, A, N, E, U, D, Y**.  
- Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, S, T, V, W, X, Z.  

**Strategy for guess 4:**  
- We need to solve for position 2 and position 5.  
- The word **""choli""** (C H O L I) fits the pattern:  
  - Position 1: **C** (✓).

  - Position 2: **H** (tests a new letter).

  - Position 3: **O** (✓).

  - Position 4: **L** (✓).

  - Position 5: **I** (tests a new letter).

- **H** and **I** are not excluded, making this a valid guess.  
- If correct, this solves the puzzle. If not, the feedback will reveal more about positions 2 and 5.",Guess 4: choli -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) O(✓) L(✓) I(✓),SUCCESS
