We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has A in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and got a dash).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We can use this information to make our second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position.
   - Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ _ A _ _

 And the word must contain E, but not at the end.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

 We also want to avoid C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try ""SLATE"", but note that we have A in the 3rd position, so:
     S L A T E -> but E is at the end, and we know E is not in the 5th position? 
   However, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot put E at the end.

 We must avoid putting E at the end.

 Let's think of words with E in the first, second, or fourth position.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: E _ A _ _
   Position 2: _ E A _ _
   Position 4: _ _ A E _

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to use a word that has S, T, and E in one of these positions.

 Example words:
   ""STEAL"": 
      S T E A L -> but note the A is in the 4th position? We need A in the 3rd. So that doesn't work.

 We need A in the 3rd.

 Let me try to form words:

   With E in position 1: E _ A _ _
        E.g., ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L are new, and we avoid R (which is not in this) but we have A in 3rd? 
        ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So no.

   How about ""EVADE"": 
        E V A D E -> A is in 3rd? Yes: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). 
        But we have E at the end, which we must avoid because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot have E at the end? 
        But note: the word has two E's? The feedback only tells us that there is at least one E, and it's not at the end. 
        However, the word might have another E? But we don't know. 

        But in our guess, we can have E only once? Actually, we can have multiple, but we don't know.

        However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was at the end. But the secret word has E somewhere else and maybe another E? 

        But we must avoid putting E at the end in our guess? Actually, we can put E at the end in our guess to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end, we know it will be marked as not present or? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark a letter as present (dash) if it is in the word but in the wrong position, and absent (x) if it is not in the word. 
        But we know that E is in the word, so if we put E in the 5th position, we know it will be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at the end). 
        However, we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We want to test E in a new position to see if it is the correct position.

        So it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried: position 1, 2, or 4.

   How about ""STEAM"":
        S T E A M -> A is in the 4th? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

   We need the 3rd letter to be A.

   Let me think of words: 
        _ _ A _ E -> but we cannot put E at the end? Actually, we can, but we know it will be dash. So we avoid the end for E.

   How about ""SHEAR"": 
        S H E A R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

   We must avoid R.

   How about ""STEAK"": 
        S T E A K -> A is in the 4th? No, we need A in the 3rd. So the word must be: 
        [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

   We want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Let me try E in position 1: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" (but has E at the end too) -> not good because of E at the end.
        ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> has E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? But we need to include E because we know it's in the word? 
        Wait, we don't have to include E in the next guess? Actually, we can, but we know E is in the word so we might want to test it in a new position.

   But we are required to make a valid word. We can leave out E? 
   However, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, we might miss information about its position. 
   But we can include it to get more information.

   Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tried (position 1, 2, or 4) to see if it is correct.

   Let me try to find words with A in the 3rd, E in the 1st, and without C, R, N.

   Words: 
        ""EASTS"" -> not 5 distinct? and has S at the end? Also, we don't know about S.

   But note: we have to avoid R and N and C.

   Another idea: ""LEAST"" -> 
        L E A S T -> A is in the 3rd? 
        L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position. 
        And we avoid C, R, N.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not. We are testing.

   Also, we can test other common letters: S, T, L.

   So ""LEAST"" seems a good candidate.

   However, note that the feedback for the first guess had E in the 5th position marked as dash, meaning E is in the word but not at the end. 
   In ""LEAST"", E is in the 2nd position. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash.

   But we also want to test other letters.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"":
        P L A T E -> A in 3rd, E at the end -> avoid because we know E is not at the end? 
        But we can use it? Actually, we can, but we know the E at the end will be dash. So we are wasting a position? 
        We want to test E in a new position.

   So let's avoid putting E at the end.

   Another word: ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S -> A in 3rd? 
        B(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not.

   We can also consider ""TEAMS"": 
        T E A M S -> same as above.

   But note: we have not tried T, S, L, etc.

   Another idea: put E in the 4th position: 
        _ _ A E _

   Words: ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", ""SPADE"", ""GRACE"" (but has R and C -> not allowed) -> avoid.

   How about ""PLATE"": 
        P L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   ""PHASE"": 
        P H A S E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""BLAME"": 
        B L A M E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It's hard to find a word with E in the 4th without having E at the end? 

   How about ""CAUSE"": but has C -> not allowed.

   ""PAUSE"": 
        P A U S E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   We need A in the 3rd.

   How about ""SOLAR"": but has R and is 5 letters? No, SOLAR is 5 letters: S O L A R -> A is in the 4th? Not 3rd.

   Let me think: 
        _ _ A _ _ -> we want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Position 4: 
        ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SHAPE"": 
        S H A P E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It seems that many words with A in the 3rd and E in the 4th or 5th end with E? 

   How about ""DIARY"": 
        D I A R Y -> has R -> not allowed.

   How about ""OCEAN"": 
        O C E A N -> has C and N -> not allowed.

   We need to avoid C, R, N.

   Let me try E in the 2nd position: 
        _ E A _ _

   Words: 
        ""LEAST"" (as above) -> good.
        ""BEAST"" -> B E A S T -> good.
        ""TEASE"" -> T E A S E -> but has E at the end -> avoid? Actually, we can use it? But we know the E at the end will be dash. 
        However, we are testing E in the 2nd and also we get information about S and T.

   But note: we are allowed to use words that have E at the end? We can, but we know the E at the end will be marked as dash and we don't gain new information about E's position. 
   So it's better to avoid the end for E.

   Therefore, let's choose a word with E in the 1st or 2nd or 4th (but not 5th) and A in the 3rd.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good candidate:
        L E A S T
        Positions: 
          1: L -> we don't know
          2: E -> we are testing if E is in the 2nd
          3: A -> we know is correct (so we expect a check for A)
          4: S -> test S
          5: T -> test T

   But note: we know A is in the 3rd, so we will get a check for A.

   We are testing E in the 2nd and also testing L, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S
        Tests B, E (in 2nd), A (check), D, S.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd.

   Another word: ""DEALT"": 
        D E A L T -> A in 3rd? 
        D(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd and avoids the end for E.

   But we don't know if D, L, T are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""DEALT"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we have E in the 2nd. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is in the word but not in the 2nd (so it must be in position 1 or 4? but we don't have a word for that?).

   We can also consider ""PEACH"": has C -> not allowed.

   Another word: ""MEALS"": 
        M E A L S -> A in 3rd? 
        M(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd.

   But we don't know if M, L, S are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""MEALS"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we are testing E in the 2nd.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E in the 1st position: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" -> has E at the end? Actually, ""EVADE"" is E V A D E -> so E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? Then we don't get information about E. 
        But we know E is in the word, so we are not testing E in this word? 
        We are testing X, but not E? That doesn't help.

   We should include E to get more information about its position.

   So let's go with ""LEAST"" or ""BEADS"" or ""MEALS"".

   I think ""LEAST"" is a common word and tests common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N.

   ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   So I will go with ""LEAST"".

   However, let me check: the secret word has A in the 3rd and E somewhere (not 5th). In ""LEAST"", we have:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in the word? we don't know.
        Position 2: E -> if E is in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is not in the 2nd (so it must be in 1st or 4th).
        Position 3: A -> we know is correct (so we get a check)
        Position 4: S -> test S
        Position 5: T -> test T

   This seems good.

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the end. So in ""LEAST"", we are putting E at the 2nd. If the secret word has E at the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know E is not in the 2nd, so it must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing S and T.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st position? 

   How about ""EAGLE"": 
        E A G L E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   How about ""EJECT"": has C and J -> not allowed.

   How about ""ELATE"": 
        E L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""EBAY"": not 5 letters.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

   Let me confirm: ""LEAST"" is a valid word.

   So I will guess ""LEAST"".

   However, we must avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N. ""LEAST"" has L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   We are testing L, E, S, T.

   If we get:
        L: if in the word? 
        E: if in the 2nd? 
        A: check (always)
        S: present? 
        T: present?

   This will give us more information.

   So the next guess: ""LEAST""

   But note: we know the secret word has E, so we are testing E in the 2nd. If we get a dash for E, then we know E is not in the 2nd and must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing L, S, T.

   This seems efficient.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" but then E is at the end -> we know it will be dash, so we don't learn about E's position. So we avoid.

   Therefore, I choose ""LEAST"".

<guess>least</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
- Must avoid C, R, and N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""least"" fits these criteria:
- L (new) in position 1.
- E in position 2 (testing if E is in this new position).
- A in position 3 (known correct).
- S and T (new) in positions 4 and 5.

This guess efficiently tests E's position and new letters while avoiding forbidden letters.

<guess>least</guess>",least,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has A in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and got a dash).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We can use this information to make our second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position.
   - Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ _ A _ _

 And the word must contain E, but not at the end.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

 We also want to avoid C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try ""SLATE"", but note that we have A in the 3rd position, so:
     S L A T E -> but E is at the end, and we know E is not in the 5th position? 
   However, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot put E at the end.

 We must avoid putting E at the end.

 Let's think of words with E in the first, second, or fourth position.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: E _ A _ _
   Position 2: _ E A _ _
   Position 4: _ _ A E _

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to use a word that has S, T, and E in one of these positions.

 Example words:
   ""STEAL"": 
      S T E A L -> but note the A is in the 4th position? We need A in the 3rd. So that doesn't work.

 We need A in the 3rd.

 Let me try to form words:

   With E in position 1: E _ A _ _
        E.g., ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L are new, and we avoid R (which is not in this) but we have A in 3rd? 
        ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So no.

   How about ""EVADE"": 
        E V A D E -> A is in 3rd? Yes: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). 
        But we have E at the end, which we must avoid because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot have E at the end? 
        But note: the word has two E's? The feedback only tells us that there is at least one E, and it's not at the end. 
        However, the word might have another E? But we don't know. 

        But in our guess, we can have E only once? Actually, we can have multiple, but we don't know.

        However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was at the end. But the secret word has E somewhere else and maybe another E? 

        But we must avoid putting E at the end in our guess? Actually, we can put E at the end in our guess to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end, we know it will be marked as not present or? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark a letter as present (dash) if it is in the word but in the wrong position, and absent (x) if it is not in the word. 
        But we know that E is in the word, so if we put E in the 5th position, we know it will be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at the end). 
        However, we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We want to test E in a new position to see if it is the correct position.

        So it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried: position 1, 2, or 4.

   How about ""STEAM"":
        S T E A M -> A is in the 4th? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

   We need the 3rd letter to be A.

   Let me think of words: 
        _ _ A _ E -> but we cannot put E at the end? Actually, we can, but we know it will be dash. So we avoid the end for E.

   How about ""SHEAR"": 
        S H E A R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

   We must avoid R.

   How about ""STEAK"": 
        S T E A K -> A is in the 4th? No, we need A in the 3rd. So the word must be: 
        [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

   We want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Let me try E in position 1: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" (but has E at the end too) -> not good because of E at the end.
        ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> has E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? But we need to include E because we know it's in the word? 
        Wait, we don't have to include E in the next guess? Actually, we can, but we know E is in the word so we might want to test it in a new position.

   But we are required to make a valid word. We can leave out E? 
   However, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, we might miss information about its position. 
   But we can include it to get more information.

   Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tried (position 1, 2, or 4) to see if it is correct.

   Let me try to find words with A in the 3rd, E in the 1st, and without C, R, N.

   Words: 
        ""EASTS"" -> not 5 distinct? and has S at the end? Also, we don't know about S.

   But note: we have to avoid R and N and C.

   Another idea: ""LEAST"" -> 
        L E A S T -> A is in the 3rd? 
        L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position. 
        And we avoid C, R, N.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not. We are testing.

   Also, we can test other common letters: S, T, L.

   So ""LEAST"" seems a good candidate.

   However, note that the feedback for the first guess had E in the 5th position marked as dash, meaning E is in the word but not at the end. 
   In ""LEAST"", E is in the 2nd position. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash.

   But we also want to test other letters.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"":
        P L A T E -> A in 3rd, E at the end -> avoid because we know E is not at the end? 
        But we can use it? Actually, we can, but we know the E at the end will be dash. So we are wasting a position? 
        We want to test E in a new position.

   So let's avoid putting E at the end.

   Another word: ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S -> A in 3rd? 
        B(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not.

   We can also consider ""TEAMS"": 
        T E A M S -> same as above.

   But note: we have not tried T, S, L, etc.

   Another idea: put E in the 4th position: 
        _ _ A E _

   Words: ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", ""SPADE"", ""GRACE"" (but has R and C -> not allowed) -> avoid.

   How about ""PLATE"": 
        P L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   ""PHASE"": 
        P H A S E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""BLAME"": 
        B L A M E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It's hard to find a word with E in the 4th without having E at the end? 

   How about ""CAUSE"": but has C -> not allowed.

   ""PAUSE"": 
        P A U S E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   We need A in the 3rd.

   How about ""SOLAR"": but has R and is 5 letters? No, SOLAR is 5 letters: S O L A R -> A is in the 4th? Not 3rd.

   Let me think: 
        _ _ A _ _ -> we want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Position 4: 
        ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SHAPE"": 
        S H A P E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It seems that many words with A in the 3rd and E in the 4th or 5th end with E? 

   How about ""DIARY"": 
        D I A R Y -> has R -> not allowed.

   How about ""OCEAN"": 
        O C E A N -> has C and N -> not allowed.

   We need to avoid C, R, N.

   Let me try E in the 2nd position: 
        _ E A _ _

   Words: 
        ""LEAST"" (as above) -> good.
        ""BEAST"" -> B E A S T -> good.
        ""TEASE"" -> T E A S E -> but has E at the end -> avoid? Actually, we can use it? But we know the E at the end will be dash. 
        However, we are testing E in the 2nd and also we get information about S and T.

   But note: we are allowed to use words that have E at the end? We can, but we know the E at the end will be marked as dash and we don't gain new information about E's position. 
   So it's better to avoid the end for E.

   Therefore, let's choose a word with E in the 1st or 2nd or 4th (but not 5th) and A in the 3rd.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good candidate:
        L E A S T
        Positions: 
          1: L -> we don't know
          2: E -> we are testing if E is in the 2nd
          3: A -> we know is correct (so we expect a check for A)
          4: S -> test S
          5: T -> test T

   But note: we know A is in the 3rd, so we will get a check for A.

   We are testing E in the 2nd and also testing L, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S
        Tests B, E (in 2nd), A (check), D, S.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd.

   Another word: ""DEALT"": 
        D E A L T -> A in 3rd? 
        D(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd and avoids the end for E.

   But we don't know if D, L, T are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""DEALT"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we have E in the 2nd. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is in the word but not in the 2nd (so it must be in position 1 or 4? but we don't have a word for that?).

   We can also consider ""PEACH"": has C -> not allowed.

   Another word: ""MEALS"": 
        M E A L S -> A in 3rd? 
        M(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd.

   But we don't know if M, L, S are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""MEALS"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we are testing E in the 2nd.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E in the 1st position: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" -> has E at the end? Actually, ""EVADE"" is E V A D E -> so E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? Then we don't get information about E. 
        But we know E is in the word, so we are not testing E in this word? 
        We are testing X, but not E? That doesn't help.

   We should include E to get more information about its position.

   So let's go with ""LEAST"" or ""BEADS"" or ""MEALS"".

   I think ""LEAST"" is a common word and tests common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N.

   ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   So I will go with ""LEAST"".

   However, let me check: the secret word has A in the 3rd and E somewhere (not 5th). In ""LEAST"", we have:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in the word? we don't know.
        Position 2: E -> if E is in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is not in the 2nd (so it must be in 1st or 4th).
        Position 3: A -> we know is correct (so we get a check)
        Position 4: S -> test S
        Position 5: T -> test T

   This seems good.

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the end. So in ""LEAST"", we are putting E at the 2nd. If the secret word has E at the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know E is not in the 2nd, so it must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing S and T.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st position? 

   How about ""EAGLE"": 
        E A G L E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   How about ""EJECT"": has C and J -> not allowed.

   How about ""ELATE"": 
        E L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""EBAY"": not 5 letters.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

   Let me confirm: ""LEAST"" is a valid word.

   So I will guess ""LEAST"".

   However, we must avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N. ""LEAST"" has L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   We are testing L, E, S, T.

   If we get:
        L: if in the word? 
        E: if in the 2nd? 
        A: check (always)
        S: present? 
        T: present?

   This will give us more information.

   So the next guess: ""LEAST""

   But note: we know the secret word has E, so we are testing E in the 2nd. If we get a dash for E, then we know E is not in the 2nd and must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing L, S, T.

   This seems efficient.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" but then E is at the end -> we know it will be dash, so we don't learn about E's position. So we avoid.

   Therefore, I choose ""LEAST"".

<guess>least</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
- Must avoid C, R, and N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""least"" fits these criteria:
- L (new) in position 1.
- E in position 2 (testing if E is in this new position).
- A in position 3 (known correct).
- S and T (new) in positions 4 and 5.

This guess efficiently tests E's position and new letters while avoiding forbidden letters.",Guess 2: least -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(-) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 04 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word has A in the 3rd position.
 - The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position (since in ""crane"" it was at the end and got a dash).
 - The letters C, R, and N are not in the word.

 We can use this information to make our second guess.

 We need to choose a 5-letter word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position.
   - Includes the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
   - Does not include C, R, or N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ _ A _ _

 And the word must contain E, but not at the end.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, or 4.

 We also want to avoid C, R, N.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has E in a different position and includes other common letters.

 Example: 
   We could try ""SLATE"", but note that we have A in the 3rd position, so:
     S L A T E -> but E is at the end, and we know E is not in the 5th position? 
   However, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot put E at the end.

 We must avoid putting E at the end.

 Let's think of words with E in the first, second, or fourth position.

 Possibilities:
   Position 1: E _ A _ _
   Position 2: _ E A _ _
   Position 4: _ _ A E _

 We also want to test other common letters.

 Let's try to use a word that has S, T, and E in one of these positions.

 Example words:
   ""STEAL"": 
      S T E A L -> but note the A is in the 4th position? We need A in the 3rd. So that doesn't work.

 We need A in the 3rd.

 Let me try to form words:

   With E in position 1: E _ A _ _
        E.g., ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L are new, and we avoid R (which is not in this) but we have A in 3rd? 
        ""EAGLE"": E A G L E -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So no.

   How about ""EVADE"": 
        E V A D E -> A is in 3rd? Yes: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). 
        But we have E at the end, which we must avoid because the feedback said E is not in the 5th position? 
        Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not in the 5th position. So we cannot have E at the end? 
        But note: the word has two E's? The feedback only tells us that there is at least one E, and it's not at the end. 
        However, the word might have another E? But we don't know. 

        But in our guess, we can have E only once? Actually, we can have multiple, but we don't know.

        However, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was at the end. But the secret word has E somewhere else and maybe another E? 

        But we must avoid putting E at the end in our guess? Actually, we can put E at the end in our guess to test, but we know that the secret word does not have E at the end. So if we put E at the end, we know it will be marked as not present or? 
        Actually, the feedback will mark a letter as present (dash) if it is in the word but in the wrong position, and absent (x) if it is not in the word. 
        But we know that E is in the word, so if we put E in the 5th position, we know it will be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at the end). 
        However, we already know that, so it doesn't give new information. We want to test E in a new position to see if it is the correct position.

        So it's better to put E in a position we haven't tried: position 1, 2, or 4.

   How about ""STEAM"":
        S T E A M -> A is in the 4th? We need A in the 3rd. So no.

   We need the 3rd letter to be A.

   Let me think of words: 
        _ _ A _ E -> but we cannot put E at the end? Actually, we can, but we know it will be dash. So we avoid the end for E.

   How about ""SHEAR"": 
        S H E A R -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word from the first feedback). So we cannot use R.

   We must avoid R.

   How about ""STEAK"": 
        S T E A K -> A is in the 4th? No, we need A in the 3rd. So the word must be: 
        [letter1] [letter2] A [letter4] [letter5]

   We want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Let me try E in position 1: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" (but has E at the end too) -> not good because of E at the end.
        ""ELATE"": E L A T E -> has E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? But we need to include E because we know it's in the word? 
        Wait, we don't have to include E in the next guess? Actually, we can, but we know E is in the word so we might want to test it in a new position.

   But we are required to make a valid word. We can leave out E? 
   However, we know E is in the word, so if we don't include E, we might miss information about its position. 
   But we can include it to get more information.

   Alternatively, we can put E in a position we haven't tried (position 1, 2, or 4) to see if it is correct.

   Let me try to find words with A in the 3rd, E in the 1st, and without C, R, N.

   Words: 
        ""EASTS"" -> not 5 distinct? and has S at the end? Also, we don't know about S.

   But note: we have to avoid R and N and C.

   Another idea: ""LEAST"" -> 
        L E A S T -> A is in the 3rd? 
        L(1), E(2), A(3), S(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position. 
        And we avoid C, R, N.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not. We are testing.

   Also, we can test other common letters: S, T, L.

   So ""LEAST"" seems a good candidate.

   However, note that the feedback for the first guess had E in the 5th position marked as dash, meaning E is in the word but not at the end. 
   In ""LEAST"", E is in the 2nd position. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash.

   But we also want to test other letters.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"":
        P L A T E -> A in 3rd, E at the end -> avoid because we know E is not at the end? 
        But we can use it? Actually, we can, but we know the E at the end will be dash. So we are wasting a position? 
        We want to test E in a new position.

   So let's avoid putting E at the end.

   Another word: ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S -> A in 3rd? 
        B(1), E(2), A(3), D(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd position.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd or not.

   We can also consider ""TEAMS"": 
        T E A M S -> same as above.

   But note: we have not tried T, S, L, etc.

   Another idea: put E in the 4th position: 
        _ _ A E _

   Words: ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", ""SPADE"", ""GRACE"" (but has R and C -> not allowed) -> avoid.

   How about ""PLATE"": 
        P L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   ""PHASE"": 
        P H A S E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""BLAME"": 
        B L A M E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It's hard to find a word with E in the 4th without having E at the end? 

   How about ""CAUSE"": but has C -> not allowed.

   ""PAUSE"": 
        P A U S E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   We need A in the 3rd.

   How about ""SOLAR"": but has R and is 5 letters? No, SOLAR is 5 letters: S O L A R -> A is in the 4th? Not 3rd.

   Let me think: 
        _ _ A _ _ -> we want E in position 1, 2, or 4.

   Position 4: 
        ""SHADE"": S H A D E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""SHAPE"": 
        S H A P E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   ""SLATE"": S L A T E -> E at the end -> avoid.

   It seems that many words with A in the 3rd and E in the 4th or 5th end with E? 

   How about ""DIARY"": 
        D I A R Y -> has R -> not allowed.

   How about ""OCEAN"": 
        O C E A N -> has C and N -> not allowed.

   We need to avoid C, R, N.

   Let me try E in the 2nd position: 
        _ E A _ _

   Words: 
        ""LEAST"" (as above) -> good.
        ""BEAST"" -> B E A S T -> good.
        ""TEASE"" -> T E A S E -> but has E at the end -> avoid? Actually, we can use it? But we know the E at the end will be dash. 
        However, we are testing E in the 2nd and also we get information about S and T.

   But note: we are allowed to use words that have E at the end? We can, but we know the E at the end will be marked as dash and we don't gain new information about E's position. 
   So it's better to avoid the end for E.

   Therefore, let's choose a word with E in the 1st or 2nd or 4th (but not 5th) and A in the 3rd.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good candidate:
        L E A S T
        Positions: 
          1: L -> we don't know
          2: E -> we are testing if E is in the 2nd
          3: A -> we know is correct (so we expect a check for A)
          4: S -> test S
          5: T -> test T

   But note: we know A is in the 3rd, so we will get a check for A.

   We are testing E in the 2nd and also testing L, S, T.

   Alternatively, we can try ""BEADS"": 
        B E A D S
        Tests B, E (in 2nd), A (check), D, S.

   But we don't know if E is in the 2nd.

   Another word: ""DEALT"": 
        D E A L T -> A in 3rd? 
        D(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd and avoids the end for E.

   But we don't know if D, L, T are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""DEALT"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we have E in the 2nd. If the secret word has E in the 2nd, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is in the word but not in the 2nd (so it must be in position 1 or 4? but we don't have a word for that?).

   We can also consider ""PEACH"": has C -> not allowed.

   Another word: ""MEALS"": 
        M E A L S -> A in 3rd? 
        M(1), E(2), A(3), L(4), S(5). 
        This has E in the 2nd.

   But we don't know if M, L, S are in the word.

   However, we have to avoid R, C, N. ""MEALS"" doesn't have them.

   But note: we are testing E in the 2nd.

   Alternatively, we can try to put E in the 1st position: 
        E _ A _ _

   Words: ""EVADE"" -> has E at the end? Actually, ""EVADE"" is E V A D E -> so E at the end. Avoid.

   How about ""EXAMS"": 
        E X A M S -> no E at the end? Actually, no E at all? Then we don't get information about E. 
        But we know E is in the word, so we are not testing E in this word? 
        We are testing X, but not E? That doesn't help.

   We should include E to get more information about its position.

   So let's go with ""LEAST"" or ""BEADS"" or ""MEALS"".

   I think ""LEAST"" is a common word and tests common letters.

   But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N.

   ""LEAST"": L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   So I will go with ""LEAST"".

   However, let me check: the secret word has A in the 3rd and E somewhere (not 5th). In ""LEAST"", we have:
        Position 1: L -> if L is in the word? we don't know.
        Position 2: E -> if E is in the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, we get a dash and know E is not in the 2nd (so it must be in 1st or 4th).
        Position 3: A -> we know is correct (so we get a check)
        Position 4: S -> test S
        Position 5: T -> test T

   This seems good.

   But wait: the feedback for the first guess said E is in the word but not at the end. So in ""LEAST"", we are putting E at the 2nd. If the secret word has E at the 2nd, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know E is not in the 2nd, so it must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing S and T.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in the 1st position? 

   How about ""EAGLE"": 
        E A G L E -> A is in the 2nd, not 3rd.

   How about ""EJECT"": has C and J -> not allowed.

   How about ""ELATE"": 
        E L A T E -> but E at the end -> avoid.

   How about ""EBAY"": not 5 letters.

   I think ""LEAST"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to make sure the word is valid.

   Let me confirm: ""LEAST"" is a valid word.

   So I will guess ""LEAST"".

   However, we must avoid the known absent letters: C, R, N. ""LEAST"" has L, E, A, S, T -> no C, R, N. Good.

   We are testing L, E, S, T.

   If we get:
        L: if in the word? 
        E: if in the 2nd? 
        A: check (always)
        S: present? 
        T: present?

   This will give us more information.

   So the next guess: ""LEAST""

   But note: we know the secret word has E, so we are testing E in the 2nd. If we get a dash for E, then we know E is not in the 2nd and must be in 1st or 4th.

   We are also testing L, S, T.

   This seems efficient.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PLATE"" but then E is at the end -> we know it will be dash, so we don't learn about E's position. So we avoid.

   Therefore, I choose ""LEAST"".

<guess>least</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).
- C, R, and N are not in the word (x).

For the next guess:
- Must have A in the 3rd position.
- Must include E (since it's in the word), but not in the 5th position.
- Must avoid C, R, and N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L) to gather more information.

The word ""least"" fits these criteria:
- L (new) in position 1.
- E in position 2 (testing if E is in this new position).
- A in position 3 (known correct).
- S and T (new) in positions 4 and 5.

This guess efficiently tests E's position and new letters while avoiding forbidden letters.

We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but not in the 5th position)

Guess 2: ""least""
  L: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has E in the 2nd position)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
  S: - (in the word but not in the 4th position)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 2nd position. So the word is: _ E A _ _
2. The secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position.
3. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, L, T.
4. E is in the word and we now know it is in the 2nd position (from the second guess).

Also, from the first guess, we knew E was in the word but not in the 5th position. Now we know it is in the 2nd position, so that is confirmed.

Now, the word pattern is: _ E A _ _

We know the word has an S, but not in the 4th position. So S must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
  1: unknown
  2: E (fixed)
  3: A (fixed)
  4: unknown
  5: unknown

S is in the word but not in position 4. So S can be in position 1 or 5.

But note: we also have to account for the fact that the word must contain S and we know it's not in position 4.

Additionally, we have eliminated the letters: C, R, N, L, T.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern _ E A _ _ and includes S (in position 1 or 5) and avoids C, R, N, L, T.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: D, G, H, I, O, U, etc.

Let's list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the 5 we know are absent (C, R, N, L, T) and the 2 we know are present (A, E, S). So we have 19 letters left.

But note: we have two positions that are unknown: position 1, 4, and 5. However, one of these must be S? Actually, S must be in the word and can only be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S and position 2 and 3 are taken by E and A).

So the word must have S in either position 1 or position 5.

We can consider two cases: S in position 1 or S in position 5.

But we can design a guess that will help us distinguish these and also test other letters.

We also note that we have two more known letters: E and A.

We can try to use a word that has S in position 1 and then test other letters, or S in position 5 and test others.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.

First, if S is in position 1: S E A _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters that are not C, R, N, L, T, and form a valid word.

Possible words: 
  ""SEAMS"" -> but has M and S at the end? Also, we have two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we can try.
  ""SEATS"" -> but T is not allowed (we know T is absent).
  ""SEADE"" -> not a common word? and has D and E? But E is already in the word? We don't know if D is in the word.

But note: we must avoid T.

How about ""SEAGLE""? Not 5 letters? ""SEAGLE"" is 6.

""SEAPA""? Not a word.

""SEPIA""? Not common.

""SEPIA"" is a word? It is a pigment. But let's see: S E P I A -> but A is in the 5th? We need A in the 3rd. So the pattern is S E A _ _.

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. How about ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> but then we have S at the end? That would be two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But note: the feedback for ""least"" had S in the 4th position marked as dash, meaning S is in the word but not at 4th. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. So it's possible.

But we can try ""SEAMS"": 
  S(1), E(2), A(3), M(4), S(5). 
  This has S at the end. 
  But we are testing M and also putting S at the end.

However, we know that the secret word has S, so if we put S at the end and it is also in the word, then we might get a check for the last S? But we don't know if there is a second S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st position and then test other letters in the 4th and 5th.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one S.

Let me think of words: 
  ""SEATS"" -> has T -> not allowed.
  ""SEAMS"" -> valid, but has S at the end? And we are testing M and S at the end.

But we are limited: we must avoid T, and T is not in the word.

Another word: ""SEIZE"": S E I Z E -> but E is at the end? We have E at the end already? And we know E is in the 2nd, so having another E? But we don't know if there is a second E. Also, the pattern: S E I Z E -> but the 3rd letter is I, not A? We need A in the 3rd.

So not.

How about ""SEAPA""? Not a word.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd.

So let's try S in the 1st position: S E A _ _

We need two letters for the last two. We can try:

  ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> but then we have two S's? And we are testing M. But note: if the secret word has only one S, then the last S will be absent? But we know the secret word has at least one S (from the first guess). It might have two.

But we are not sure. Also, we are using two S's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th position: _ E A _ S

Words: 
  ""DEADS"": D E A D S -> but D is tested twice? And we avoid D? We don't know about D.
  ""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> good.
  ""NEAPS"": but N is not allowed.
  ""WEALS"": W E A L S -> but L is not allowed (we know L is absent from the second guess).

We know L is absent, so we cannot use L.

Similarly, T is absent.

So ""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> 
  H(1), E(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). 
  This has S in the 5th position.

And H and P are new letters.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have S in the 1st position. So if we guess ""HEAPS"", we are assuming S is in the 5th. But if the secret word has S in the 1st, then we will get a dash for S in the 5th? Because S is in the word but not at the 5th? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 5th and the secret word has S in the 1st, then the S in the 5th will be marked as dash (because it's present but in the wrong position). 

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st position to test that case.

But we have two possibilities for S: position 1 or 5.

We can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has S in the 1st position and then other new letters, and if we get a dash for S, then we know S must be in the 5th position.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th position and then if we get a dash, we know S is in the 1st.

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? 

Let me think of a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, and also has E in the 2nd and A in the 3rd.

But we already have E and A fixed, so we are only testing the first, fourth, and fifth.

If we put S in the 1st, then we are testing if S is in the 1st. If we get a check for S, then we know. If we get a dash, then S must be in the 5th.

So we can use the first guess to test S in the 1st.

But we are also testing other letters.

Let me try to form a word: S E A _ _

We need two letters for the last two. We can try:

  ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> tests M and also S at the end. But if the secret word has only one S, then the last S will be absent? But we know the secret word has at least one S. So if we get a check for the first S and a dash for the last S, then we know the word has two S's? But the secret word might have two S's? We don't know.

But we are trying to solve, so we can use this to test.

However, we are using two S's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and then two new letters in the first and fourth.

For example: ""HEAPS"" (as above) or ""DEADS"" (but D is new) or ""WEALS"" (but L is absent) -> not allowed.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we put S in the 5th and get a dash (because S is in the word but not at the 5th, and we know it must be at the 1st? But we don't know if it's at the 1st, but we know it's not at the 4th, so if it's not at 5th, then it must be at 1st).

But we are testing H and P as well.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters in the 4th and 5th, without repeating S? Then we are testing S in the 1st and two new letters.

For example: ""SEAMS"" (but has two S's) or ""SEATS"" (has T -> not allowed).

""SEAPA"" is not a word.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the pattern is S E A _ _, so the 4th and 5th must be P and I? But then the word is S E A P I? Not a word.

""SEAMS"" is a word: S E A M S.

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word has S in the 1st and the word has two S's, then we get:
  S(1): check (because it's in the correct position)
  E(2): check (already known)
  A(3): check (already known)
  M(4): ? 
  S(5): ? 

But if the secret word has only one S, then the first S is check and the last S is absent (x) because the secret word only has one S and it's already used in the 1st.

So we can get:
  S(1): check
  E(2): check
  A(3): check
  M(4): if M is in the word and in the 4th? or if M is in the word but not at 4th, then dash? or if not, then x?
  S(5): if the secret word has S at the 1st, then the S at the 5th will be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be marked as absent (x) because the S is already used in the 1st? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be absent.

But we know the secret word has at least one S. If we get a check for the first S, then we know there are two S's. If we get a dash for the first S? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 1st and the secret word has S in the 5th, then we get a dash for the 1st S? Actually, no: if the secret word has S in the 5th, then the S in the 1st is in the wrong position? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 1st and the secret word has S in the 5th, then the S in the 1st should be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at 1st). And the S at the 5th would be check? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be check? Because the S is in the word and at the 5th.

But let's clarify the rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

And if there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might be tricky.

For example, if the secret word has one S, and we guess two S's: 
  - One S might be in the correct position: then that one gets ✓, and the other might get x? Or if both are wrong, one might get dash and the other x? 

But the standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one S, then only one S in the guess can be correct or misplaced, and the other is absent.

So if the secret word has one S, and we guess two S's:
  - If the first S is in the correct position: ✓ for the first S, and then the second S: since there is only one S in the secret word, the second S would be x (because the S is already used in the first position? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently, but if the secret word has one S, then the first S that is in the correct position gets a check, and the second S (if in a wrong position) would be dash? But wait, the secret word only has one S. So if we have two S's in the guess, and the secret word has one S, then one S will be marked as dash (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other as x? 

But in our case, we are going to have S in either the 1st or the 5th.

But we don't know if the secret word has one S or two.

To avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid using S twice? 

But we have to include S because we know it's in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and two new letters in the first and fourth, without repeating S.

For example: ""HEAPS"": H E A P S

This has no duplicate S, and we test H and P.

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S at the 5th.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 1st? But we don't have S in the 1st? We have H in the 1st. So if the secret word has S in the 1st, then the H is not in the word, so H would be x. And the S at the 5th: since the secret word has S in the 1st, then the S at the 5th is in the word but in the wrong position? But wait, the secret word has only one S? Then the S at the 5th would be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at the 5th). And the H would be x.

But we also get information about H and P.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st: S E A _ _

Without repeating S: 
  ""SEAMS"" has two S's -> avoid for now.
  ""SEATS"" has T -> not allowed.
  ""SEPIA"": not a common word? and has I and P.

""SEPIA"" is a word? It is a dye, but let's see: S E P I A -> A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the word must be S E A P I? That's 5 letters? S E A P I -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:P, 5:I. 
But is ""SEPIA"" a valid word? It is accepted in some dictionaries as a color term. But let's see: we are avoiding common words? We should use common words.

""SEAMS"" is a common word.

But let's consider: we can try ""SEAMS"" to test if S is in the 1st and also test M.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""SEIZE"": but has Z and E at the end? And E at the end is not allowed? We know E is in the 2nd, so having E at the end would be duplicate? But we don't know about duplicate E. However, we are not allowed to have E at the end because we know E is in the 2nd and we don't want to waste a position.

So avoid E at the end.

Another word: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word I can think of for S in the 1st.

But let's try S in the 5th: words like ""HEAPS"", ""JEANS"" (but has N -> not allowed), ""WEALS"" (has L -> not allowed), ""DEADS"" (has D and S at the end). 

""DEADS"": D E A D S -> has D and S at the end. But we don't know about D.

But we can use ""DEADS"", but we are repeating D? And we don't know if D is in the word.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> tests H and P.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice because it tests H and P, and we get information about the 1st, 4th, and 5th.

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S at the 5th.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 5th (because S is in the word but not at 5th) and then we know S must be at 1st.

Also, we test H and P.

But note: we know the secret word has S, so if we get a dash for S at the 5th, then we know S is in the 1st. And then we can try to form a word with S at the 1st and the known E and A.

But we are testing H and P.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters: ""SEAMS"" (but repeats S) or ""SEATS"" (has T).

""SEATS"" has T -> not allowed.

""SEAMS"" is the best we can do for S in the 1st without using forbidden letters.

But let's try to find a word with S in the 5th and without repeating letters.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> no repeat, and tests H and P.

Similarly, ""WEALS"" is not allowed because of L.

""JEANS"" is not allowed because of N.

""DEADS"": D E A D S -> repeats D? And we don't know about D.

""MEADS"": M E A D S -> same as above.

But we don't know about D or M or H or P.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> tests B and D.

But we don't know about B and D.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice because it tests two common consonants: H and P.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"".

But note: we are also testing the 4th and 5th letters.

If we get:
  H: if in the word? and if in the 1st? 
  E: check (2nd)
  A: check (3rd)
  P: if in the 4th?
  S: if in the 5th? or if the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 5th.

But we will know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters: ""SEAMS"" (but repeats S) or ""SEPIA"" (not common).

I think ""HEAPS"" is a common word and a good test.

But let me see: the secret word pattern is _ E A _ _

We know S is in the word and must be in 1 or 5.

By guessing ""HEAPS"", we are testing:
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: E (known)
  Position 3: A (known)
  Position 4: P
  Position 5: S

We will get feedback on H, P, and S.

If S at the 5th is check, then we know S is in the 5th and the word is _ E A _ S.
If S at the 5th is dash, then we know S must be in the 1st, and the word is S E A _ _.

Then we can try to find the word with S in the 1st.

But we also get information about H and P.

So let's do ""HEAPS"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""SEAMS""? Then we would get:
  H: x (if we guess ""HEAPS"" and the secret word is ""SEAMS"", then:
      H: not in the word -> x
      E: check
      A: check
      P: not in the word -> x (if ""SEAMS"" has no P) or if P is in the word? ""SEAMS"" has M and S, no P. So P would be x.
      S: in the word but not at the 5th? In ""SEAMS"", S is at the 1st and 5th. So when we guess ""HEAPS"", which has S only at the 5th, then the S at the 5th would be dash (because there is an S in the word but not at 5th) and the first S in our guess is not present? Because the secret word has two S's? 

But the feedback for ""HEAPS"" if the secret word is ""SEAMS"":
  H: x (not in ""SEAMS"")
  E: check
  A: check
  P: x (not in ""SEAMS"")
  S: dash (because there is an S in the secret word at position 1, so the S at the 5th is misplaced)

So we would get: H(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x) S(-)

Then we would know that S is in the word but not at the 5th, so it must be at the 1st. Then we can guess a word with S at the 1st and E at the 2nd and A at the 3rd.

Then we can try ""SEAMS"" for the next guess? But we have two S's? Actually, we know the word has at least one S, but it might have two. If we get a dash for S in the 5th, then we know there is an S at the 1st, so the word is S E A _ _.

Then we can try ""SEAMS"" to test.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 4 more after this.

But we can try ""SEAMS"" now? But it has two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, without repeating S.

For example: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word? 

""SEAMS"" is the plural of seam, so it's valid.

But let's see if there are other words: 
  ""SEATO"" -> not a word.
  ""SEpta"" -> not 5 letters? ""SEPTA"" is 5 letters: S E P T A -> but T is absent, so not allowed.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the word must be S E A _ _, so the 4th and 5th must be two letters. ""SEPIA"" is S E P I A -> that's 5 letters: 1:S, 2:E, 3:P? No, that's not A at 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A. So the word must be [letter1] E A [letter4] [letter5].

So for S in the 1st: S E A _ _

Possible words: 
  ""SEAMS"" (with M and S at the end) -> duplicate S.
  ""SEATS"" (has T) -> not allowed.
  ""SEIZE"" (has Z and E at the end) -> E at the end is not allowed.

I think ""SEAMS"" is the best we can do.

But let's consider: we can try ""SEAMS"" now and see.

But we have to avoid T, so ""SEAMS"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and then two new letters in the first and fourth, without S in the first? But we are trying to test S in the 5th.

But we are also testing the first letter.

Another word: ""BEADS"" is B E A D S -> tests B and D, and S at the end.

But we don't know about B and D.

I think ""HEAPS"" is better because it tests two common consonants: H and P.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"".

But note: we are testing H and P. If we get a check for H? or dash? etc.

So the guess: ""HEAPS""

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H E A P S -> 
    Position 1: H
    Position 2: E (known)
    Position 3: A (known)
    Position 4: P
    Position 5: S

We expect E and A to be check. We will get feedback on H, P, and S.

If S is in the 5th, we get a check for S. If S is in the 1st, we get a dash for S (because the S in the 5th is misplaced, and we know S is in the word so it must be at 1st).

Then we know the word is either:
  If we get S(✓) then the word is H E A P S? But then we have H E A P S -> but we are testing H and P, and if S is check, then we know the last letter is S.

But if we get S(-) then we know S is in the 1st.

So we can deduce.

Also, we test H and P.

So let's do ""HEAPS"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""SEAMS""? Then we get:
  H: x (if ""SEAMS"" has no H) -> then we know H is absent.
  E: check
  A: check
  P: x (if ""SEAMS"" has no P) -> then we know P is absent.
  S: dash (because S is in the word but not at the 5th) -> then we know S is in the 1st.

Then we can guess ""SEAMS"" for the next guess.

But we have to avoid T, and ""SEAMS"" avoids T.

So we can use ""HEAPS"" to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, without repeating S. But I cannot find a common word.

Another word: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word I know that fits S in the 1st and avoids the forbidden letters.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"" for the second guess? Actually, we are making the third guess.

We are making the third guess.

So let's guess ""HEAPS"".

But note: we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters. But we have to include S.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice.

So the guess is ""heaps"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""heaps"" is a valid word.

So I will go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the correct position (3rd), E is present but not in the 5th position, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (least)**: E is in the correct position (2nd), A is confirmed in the 3rd position, S is present but not in the 4th position, and L, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ E A _ _` (E in 2nd, A in 3rd).
- S is in the word but cannot be in the 4th position. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T. We must avoid these.
- Present letters: E (fixed in 2nd), A (fixed in 3rd), S (somewhere, not in 4th).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test if S is in position 1 or 5 by placing S in the 5th position. If S gets a check, it confirms S in the 5th. If S gets a dash, it means S must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 4th and positions 2/3 are fixed).
- Test new common letters (H and P) in positions 1 and 4 to gather more information.
- The word ""heaps"" fits the pattern `_ E A _ _`, places S in the 5th (to test its position), and includes H and P (new letters).

<guess>heaps</guess>",heaps,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has A in the 3rd position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: - (in the word but not in the 5th position)

Guess 2: ""least""
  L: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has E in the 2nd position)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is still in the 3rd position)
  S: - (in the word but not in the 4th position)
  T: x (not in the word)

So, from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has A in the 3rd position and E in the 2nd position. So the word is: _ E A _ _
2. The secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position.
3. The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, L, T.
4. E is in the word and we now know it is in the 2nd position (from the second guess).

Also, from the first guess, we knew E was in the word but not in the 5th position. Now we know it is in the 2nd position, so that is confirmed.

Now, the word pattern is: _ E A _ _

We know the word has an S, but not in the 4th position. So S must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
  1: unknown
  2: E (fixed)
  3: A (fixed)
  4: unknown
  5: unknown

S is in the word but not in position 4. So S can be in position 1 or 5.

But note: we also have to account for the fact that the word must contain S and we know it's not in position 4.

Additionally, we have eliminated the letters: C, R, N, L, T.

We need to choose a word that fits the pattern _ E A _ _ and includes S (in position 1 or 5) and avoids C, R, N, L, T.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried yet, such as: D, G, H, I, O, U, etc.

Let's list the available letters: we have 26 letters minus the 5 we know are absent (C, R, N, L, T) and the 2 we know are present (A, E, S). So we have 19 letters left.

But note: we have two positions that are unknown: position 1, 4, and 5. However, one of these must be S? Actually, S must be in the word and can only be in position 1 or 5 (since position 4 is not allowed for S and position 2 and 3 are taken by E and A).

So the word must have S in either position 1 or position 5.

We can consider two cases: S in position 1 or S in position 5.

But we can design a guess that will help us distinguish these and also test other letters.

We also note that we have two more known letters: E and A.

We can try to use a word that has S in position 1 and then test other letters, or S in position 5 and test others.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and have S in position 1 or 5.

First, if S is in position 1: S E A _ _

We need to fill positions 4 and 5 with letters that are not C, R, N, L, T, and form a valid word.

Possible words: 
  ""SEAMS"" -> but has M and S at the end? Also, we have two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's. However, we can try.
  ""SEATS"" -> but T is not allowed (we know T is absent).
  ""SEADE"" -> not a common word? and has D and E? But E is already in the word? We don't know if D is in the word.

But note: we must avoid T.

How about ""SEAGLE""? Not 5 letters? ""SEAGLE"" is 6.

""SEAPA""? Not a word.

""SEPIA""? Not common.

""SEPIA"" is a word? It is a pigment. But let's see: S E P I A -> but A is in the 5th? We need A in the 3rd. So the pattern is S E A _ _.

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5. How about ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> but then we have S at the end? That would be two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But note: the feedback for ""least"" had S in the 4th position marked as dash, meaning S is in the word but not at 4th. It doesn't say anything about having two S's. So it's possible.

But we can try ""SEAMS"": 
  S(1), E(2), A(3), M(4), S(5). 
  This has S at the end. 
  But we are testing M and also putting S at the end.

However, we know that the secret word has S, so if we put S at the end and it is also in the word, then we might get a check for the last S? But we don't know if there is a second S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st position and then test other letters in the 4th and 5th.

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have only one S.

Let me think of words: 
  ""SEATS"" -> has T -> not allowed.
  ""SEAMS"" -> valid, but has S at the end? And we are testing M and S at the end.

But we are limited: we must avoid T, and T is not in the word.

Another word: ""SEIZE"": S E I Z E -> but E is at the end? We have E at the end already? And we know E is in the 2nd, so having another E? But we don't know if there is a second E. Also, the pattern: S E I Z E -> but the 3rd letter is I, not A? We need A in the 3rd.

So not.

How about ""SEAPA""? Not a word.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd.

So let's try S in the 1st position: S E A _ _

We need two letters for the last two. We can try:

  ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> but then we have two S's? And we are testing M. But note: if the secret word has only one S, then the last S will be absent? But we know the secret word has at least one S (from the first guess). It might have two.

But we are not sure. Also, we are using two S's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th position: _ E A _ S

Words: 
  ""DEADS"": D E A D S -> but D is tested twice? And we avoid D? We don't know about D.
  ""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> good.
  ""NEAPS"": but N is not allowed.
  ""WEALS"": W E A L S -> but L is not allowed (we know L is absent from the second guess).

We know L is absent, so we cannot use L.

Similarly, T is absent.

So ""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> 
  H(1), E(2), A(3), P(4), S(5). 
  This has S in the 5th position.

And H and P are new letters.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have S in the 1st position. So if we guess ""HEAPS"", we are assuming S is in the 5th. But if the secret word has S in the 1st, then we will get a dash for S in the 5th? Because S is in the word but not at the 5th? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 5th and the secret word has S in the 1st, then the S in the 5th will be marked as dash (because it's present but in the wrong position). 

But we are trying to find the secret word, so we can use this to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st position to test that case.

But we have two possibilities for S: position 1 or 5.

We can design a guess that helps us determine where S is.

But we also want to test other letters.

Another idea: we can try a word that has S in the 1st position and then other new letters, and if we get a dash for S, then we know S must be in the 5th position.

But we have limited guesses, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th position and then if we get a dash, we know S is in the 1st.

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? 

Let me think of a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, and also has E in the 2nd and A in the 3rd.

But we already have E and A fixed, so we are only testing the first, fourth, and fifth.

If we put S in the 1st, then we are testing if S is in the 1st. If we get a check for S, then we know. If we get a dash, then S must be in the 5th.

So we can use the first guess to test S in the 1st.

But we are also testing other letters.

Let me try to form a word: S E A _ _

We need two letters for the last two. We can try:

  ""SEAMS"": S E A M S -> tests M and also S at the end. But if the secret word has only one S, then the last S will be absent? But we know the secret word has at least one S. So if we get a check for the first S and a dash for the last S, then we know the word has two S's? But the secret word might have two S's? We don't know.

But we are trying to solve, so we can use this to test.

However, we are using two S's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and then two new letters in the first and fourth.

For example: ""HEAPS"" (as above) or ""DEADS"" (but D is new) or ""WEALS"" (but L is absent) -> not allowed.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we put S in the 5th and get a dash (because S is in the word but not at the 5th, and we know it must be at the 1st? But we don't know if it's at the 1st, but we know it's not at the 4th, so if it's not at 5th, then it must be at 1st).

But we are testing H and P as well.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters in the 4th and 5th, without repeating S? Then we are testing S in the 1st and two new letters.

For example: ""SEAMS"" (but has two S's) or ""SEATS"" (has T -> not allowed).

""SEAPA"" is not a word.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the pattern is S E A _ _, so the 4th and 5th must be P and I? But then the word is S E A P I? Not a word.

""SEAMS"" is a word: S E A M S.

But let's see the feedback we would get:

If the secret word has S in the 1st and the word has two S's, then we get:
  S(1): check (because it's in the correct position)
  E(2): check (already known)
  A(3): check (already known)
  M(4): ? 
  S(5): ? 

But if the secret word has only one S, then the first S is check and the last S is absent (x) because the secret word only has one S and it's already used in the 1st.

So we can get:
  S(1): check
  E(2): check
  A(3): check
  M(4): if M is in the word and in the 4th? or if M is in the word but not at 4th, then dash? or if not, then x?
  S(5): if the secret word has S at the 1st, then the S at the 5th will be absent? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be marked as absent (x) because the S is already used in the 1st? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be absent.

But we know the secret word has at least one S. If we get a check for the first S, then we know there are two S's. If we get a dash for the first S? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 1st and the secret word has S in the 5th, then we get a dash for the 1st S? Actually, no: if the secret word has S in the 5th, then the S in the 1st is in the wrong position? But we know S is in the word, so if we put S in the 1st and the secret word has S in the 5th, then the S in the 1st should be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at 1st). And the S at the 5th would be check? But wait, if the secret word has only one S, then the S at the 5th would be check? Because the S is in the word and at the 5th.

But let's clarify the rules:

- If the letter is in the word and in the correct position: ✓
- If the letter is in the word but in the wrong position: -
- If the letter is not in the word: x

And if there are duplicate letters, then the feedback might be tricky.

For example, if the secret word has one S, and we guess two S's: 
  - One S might be in the correct position: then that one gets ✓, and the other might get x? Or if both are wrong, one might get dash and the other x? 

But the standard Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one S, then only one S in the guess can be correct or misplaced, and the other is absent.

So if the secret word has one S, and we guess two S's:
  - If the first S is in the correct position: ✓ for the first S, and then the second S: since there is only one S in the secret word, the second S would be x (because the S is already used in the first position? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently, but if the secret word has one S, then the first S that is in the correct position gets a check, and the second S (if in a wrong position) would be dash? But wait, the secret word only has one S. So if we have two S's in the guess, and the secret word has one S, then one S will be marked as dash (if in a position that is not the correct one) and the other as x? 

But in our case, we are going to have S in either the 1st or the 5th.

But we don't know if the secret word has one S or two.

To avoid confusion, maybe we can avoid using S twice? 

But we have to include S because we know it's in the word.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and two new letters in the first and fourth, without repeating S.

For example: ""HEAPS"": H E A P S

This has no duplicate S, and we test H and P.

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S at the 5th.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 1st? But we don't have S in the 1st? We have H in the 1st. So if the secret word has S in the 1st, then the H is not in the word, so H would be x. And the S at the 5th: since the secret word has S in the 1st, then the S at the 5th is in the word but in the wrong position? But wait, the secret word has only one S? Then the S at the 5th would be marked as dash (because it's in the word but not at the 5th). And the H would be x.

But we also get information about H and P.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st: S E A _ _

Without repeating S: 
  ""SEAMS"" has two S's -> avoid for now.
  ""SEATS"" has T -> not allowed.
  ""SEPIA"": not a common word? and has I and P.

""SEPIA"" is a word? It is a dye, but let's see: S E P I A -> A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the word must be S E A P I? That's 5 letters? S E A P I -> positions: 1:S, 2:E, 3:A, 4:P, 5:I. 
But is ""SEPIA"" a valid word? It is accepted in some dictionaries as a color term. But let's see: we are avoiding common words? We should use common words.

""SEAMS"" is a common word.

But let's consider: we can try ""SEAMS"" to test if S is in the 1st and also test M.

But we are repeating S.

Alternatively, we can try ""SEIZE"": but has Z and E at the end? And E at the end is not allowed? We know E is in the 2nd, so having E at the end would be duplicate? But we don't know about duplicate E. However, we are not allowed to have E at the end because we know E is in the 2nd and we don't want to waste a position.

So avoid E at the end.

Another word: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word I can think of for S in the 1st.

But let's try S in the 5th: words like ""HEAPS"", ""JEANS"" (but has N -> not allowed), ""WEALS"" (has L -> not allowed), ""DEADS"" (has D and S at the end). 

""DEADS"": D E A D S -> has D and S at the end. But we don't know about D.

But we can use ""DEADS"", but we are repeating D? And we don't know if D is in the word.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> tests H and P.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice because it tests H and P, and we get information about the 1st, 4th, and 5th.

If we guess ""HEAPS"", then:
  If the secret word has S in the 5th, we get a check for S at the 5th.
  If the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 5th (because S is in the word but not at 5th) and then we know S must be at 1st.

Also, we test H and P.

But note: we know the secret word has S, so if we get a dash for S at the 5th, then we know S is in the 1st. And then we can try to form a word with S at the 1st and the known E and A.

But we are testing H and P.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters: ""SEAMS"" (but repeats S) or ""SEATS"" (has T).

""SEATS"" has T -> not allowed.

""SEAMS"" is the best we can do for S in the 1st without using forbidden letters.

But let's try to find a word with S in the 5th and without repeating letters.

""HEAPS"": H E A P S -> no repeat, and tests H and P.

Similarly, ""WEALS"" is not allowed because of L.

""JEANS"" is not allowed because of N.

""DEADS"": D E A D S -> repeats D? And we don't know about D.

""MEADS"": M E A D S -> same as above.

But we don't know about D or M or H or P.

Another word: ""BEADS"": B E A D S -> tests B and D.

But we don't know about B and D.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice because it tests two common consonants: H and P.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"".

But note: we are also testing the 4th and 5th letters.

If we get:
  H: if in the word? and if in the 1st? 
  E: check (2nd)
  A: check (3rd)
  P: if in the 4th?
  S: if in the 5th? or if the secret word has S in the 1st, then we get a dash for S at the 5th.

But we will know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters: ""SEAMS"" (but repeats S) or ""SEPIA"" (not common).

I think ""HEAPS"" is a common word and a good test.

But let me see: the secret word pattern is _ E A _ _

We know S is in the word and must be in 1 or 5.

By guessing ""HEAPS"", we are testing:
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: E (known)
  Position 3: A (known)
  Position 4: P
  Position 5: S

We will get feedback on H, P, and S.

If S at the 5th is check, then we know S is in the 5th and the word is _ E A _ S.
If S at the 5th is dash, then we know S must be in the 1st, and the word is S E A _ _.

Then we can try to find the word with S in the 1st.

But we also get information about H and P.

So let's do ""HEAPS"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""SEAMS""? Then we would get:
  H: x (if we guess ""HEAPS"" and the secret word is ""SEAMS"", then:
      H: not in the word -> x
      E: check
      A: check
      P: not in the word -> x (if ""SEAMS"" has no P) or if P is in the word? ""SEAMS"" has M and S, no P. So P would be x.
      S: in the word but not at the 5th? In ""SEAMS"", S is at the 1st and 5th. So when we guess ""HEAPS"", which has S only at the 5th, then the S at the 5th would be dash (because there is an S in the word but not at 5th) and the first S in our guess is not present? Because the secret word has two S's? 

But the feedback for ""HEAPS"" if the secret word is ""SEAMS"":
  H: x (not in ""SEAMS"")
  E: check
  A: check
  P: x (not in ""SEAMS"")
  S: dash (because there is an S in the secret word at position 1, so the S at the 5th is misplaced)

So we would get: H(x) E(✓) A(✓) P(x) S(-)

Then we would know that S is in the word but not at the 5th, so it must be at the 1st. Then we can guess a word with S at the 1st and E at the 2nd and A at the 3rd.

Then we can try ""SEAMS"" for the next guess? But we have two S's? Actually, we know the word has at least one S, but it might have two. If we get a dash for S in the 5th, then we know there is an S at the 1st, so the word is S E A _ _.

Then we can try ""SEAMS"" to test.

But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 6 tries, so we have 4 more after this.

But we can try ""SEAMS"" now? But it has two S's.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, without repeating S.

For example: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word? 

""SEAMS"" is the plural of seam, so it's valid.

But let's see if there are other words: 
  ""SEATO"" -> not a word.
  ""SEpta"" -> not 5 letters? ""SEPTA"" is 5 letters: S E P T A -> but T is absent, so not allowed.

""SEPIA"": S E P I A -> but A is at the end? We need A in the 3rd. So the word must be S E A _ _, so the 4th and 5th must be two letters. ""SEPIA"" is S E P I A -> that's 5 letters: 1:S, 2:E, 3:P? No, that's not A at 3rd.

We need the 3rd to be A. So the word must be [letter1] E A [letter4] [letter5].

So for S in the 1st: S E A _ _

Possible words: 
  ""SEAMS"" (with M and S at the end) -> duplicate S.
  ""SEATS"" (has T) -> not allowed.
  ""SEIZE"" (has Z and E at the end) -> E at the end is not allowed.

I think ""SEAMS"" is the best we can do.

But let's consider: we can try ""SEAMS"" now and see.

But we have to avoid T, so ""SEAMS"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 5th and then two new letters in the first and fourth, without S in the first? But we are trying to test S in the 5th.

But we are also testing the first letter.

Another word: ""BEADS"" is B E A D S -> tests B and D, and S at the end.

But we don't know about B and D.

I think ""HEAPS"" is better because it tests two common consonants: H and P.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"".

But note: we are testing H and P. If we get a check for H? or dash? etc.

So the guess: ""HEAPS""

But let me double-check the pattern: 
  H E A P S -> 
    Position 1: H
    Position 2: E (known)
    Position 3: A (known)
    Position 4: P
    Position 5: S

We expect E and A to be check. We will get feedback on H, P, and S.

If S is in the 5th, we get a check for S. If S is in the 1st, we get a dash for S (because the S in the 5th is misplaced, and we know S is in the word so it must be at 1st).

Then we know the word is either:
  If we get S(✓) then the word is H E A P S? But then we have H E A P S -> but we are testing H and P, and if S is check, then we know the last letter is S.

But if we get S(-) then we know S is in the 1st.

So we can deduce.

Also, we test H and P.

So let's do ""HEAPS"".

But wait: what if the secret word is ""SEAMS""? Then we get:
  H: x (if ""SEAMS"" has no H) -> then we know H is absent.
  E: check
  A: check
  P: x (if ""SEAMS"" has no P) -> then we know P is absent.
  S: dash (because S is in the word but not at the 5th) -> then we know S is in the 1st.

Then we can guess ""SEAMS"" for the next guess.

But we have to avoid T, and ""SEAMS"" avoids T.

So we can use ""HEAPS"" to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has S in the 1st and then two new letters, without repeating S. But I cannot find a common word.

Another word: ""SEAMS"" is the only common word I know that fits S in the 1st and avoids the forbidden letters.

So I will go with ""HEAPS"" for the second guess? Actually, we are making the third guess.

We are making the third guess.

So let's guess ""HEAPS"".

But note: we have to output in the format.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters. But we have to include S.

I think ""HEAPS"" is a good choice.

So the guess is ""heaps"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""heaps"" is a valid word.

So I will go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A is in the correct position (3rd), E is present but not in the 5th position, and C, R, N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (least)**: E is in the correct position (2nd), A is confirmed in the 3rd position, S is present but not in the 4th position, and L, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ E A _ _` (E in 2nd, A in 3rd).
- S is in the word but cannot be in the 4th position. Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, S must be in position 1 or 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T. We must avoid these.
- Present letters: E (fixed in 2nd), A (fixed in 3rd), S (somewhere, not in 4th).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test if S is in position 1 or 5 by placing S in the 5th position. If S gets a check, it confirms S in the 5th. If S gets a dash, it means S must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 4th and positions 2/3 are fixed).
- Test new common letters (H and P) in positions 1 and 4 to gather more information.
- The word ""heaps"" fits the pattern `_ E A _ _`, places S in the 5th (to test its position), and includes H and P (new letters).",Guess 3: heaps -> FEEDBACK: H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) P(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
