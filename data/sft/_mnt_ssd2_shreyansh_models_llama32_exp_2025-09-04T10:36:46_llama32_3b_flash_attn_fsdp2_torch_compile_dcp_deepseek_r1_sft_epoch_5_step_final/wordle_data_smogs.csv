We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let's try to pick a word with other common letters.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.

 Let me try to form a word: 
 We can try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.

 However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". 

 Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.

 Let's look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""PULLY"" but that has two L's and Y? Let's avoid less common letters.

 Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So, let's list some words without these letters:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U, etc.

 Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.

 Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. 

 We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? 

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.

 But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me think of words that have U. We haven't tested U. But we can test U later.

 Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That's also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn't have any of the forbidden letters.

 Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.

 However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. 

 But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.

 So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

 However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven't tested O.

 Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

 We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". 

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.

 So, my next guess: ""MOIST""

 But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.
- It's a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.

We can consider other vowels and consonants.\n Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)\n Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.\n\n Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.\n\n However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common.

Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.\n\n Let\'s look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T.

Let\'s avoid less common letters.\n\n Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, let\'s list some words without these letters:\n\n - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U, etc.\n\n Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.\n\n However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.\n\n Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. \n\n We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? \n\n Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, let me think of words that have U. We haven\'t tested U. But we can test U later.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.\n\n So, I will go with ""MOIST"".\n\n But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That\'s also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn\'t have any of the forbidden letters.\n\n Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.\n\n However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. \n\n But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).\n\n Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.\n\n So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven\'t tested O.\n\n Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\n We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". \n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.\n\n I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""MOIST""\n\n But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. \n\nI considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.\n- It\'s a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation of ""moist"" feedback:
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".
- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

So, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.
Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

We also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:
- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).
- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).
- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).

We have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).

Additionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.

We also have positional constraints for M, O, S:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these.

Let's think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words? We can brainstorm:

We know the word has M, O, S. Let's list possible positions for them:

We have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.

So for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
S cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Some words that come to mind:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.
- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? 
- ""SHOMA"": Not common.

We need valid English words.

Another idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.

Avoid I.

What about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.

We must avoid forbidden letters.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S's, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don't have information about duplicates.

We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But let's consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. It might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.

What about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. 

We need S.

Another word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.

Avoid T.

What about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.

""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.

""POSH"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.

We must include S.

What about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words with M, O, S.

Possible words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it's 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.
- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.
- ""SOLEM"": not a word.

We need to use allowed letters.

Another word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.

What about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y's. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.

Also, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":
- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.

In ""Mousy"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.

But in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.

We should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.

In ""Mousy"":
- M is at 1 -> we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.

Let me try to rearrange:

We know:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

So for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.

Also, we have two more letters to include.

What about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.

We need S.

Another word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.

We need O.

What about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.

""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.

""POSH"": too short.

This is tricky.

What about ""SHOMA""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S's. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.

We should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.

Similarly for O and S.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOULD"": but no S.
- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. 
  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). 
  - Positions: 
    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don't gain new information about M's position.

We want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.

Similarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.

So for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).

We need a word where:
- M is not at position 1
- O is not at position 2
- S is not at position 4

And the word must be valid.

What about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.

We need M and S.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""SHOMA"": not common.

""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.

We need M.

What about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.

""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.

This is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.

Words with M, O, S and ending with them? 

Another word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? 

""SOLEM"" -> not common.

What about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let's see the positions in ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M's position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? 
- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.
  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.

We should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.

In ""BOMBS"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn anything new about O's position.

We want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.

Similarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).

For S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

So let's try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.

For example:
- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need to fill with O and S and two other letters.

What about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: W
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)
  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)

So ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.

Another word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.

What about ""LOUSY"": but no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""BOYSY"": no M.

What about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.
- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? 
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S's position? And we use a forbidden position.

We should avoid that.

So we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.

Let me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need O and S.

Example: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.

""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.

""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

This is challenging.

Another word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don't test a new position.

We need to test O in a new position. Let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S inside.

For example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.

""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.

""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.

Not working.

What about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.

Word: S _ _ _ _

With M and O.

Example: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

""SHOMA"" -> not common.

""SKIMS"" -> no O.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.

Another word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)

So not.

What about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.

We need to include M.

What about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let's try to find a better one.

Perhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

We need S.

What about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

Perhaps we should use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.

""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.

""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.

Not working.

What about M at position 3?

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.

We need to avoid O at 2.

So let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

Not working.

Perhaps O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.

We need M.

""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.

We need S.

""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.
- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

Another common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

But let's see: 
- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)
- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)

So ""BOSOM"" has:
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn the position of O.

We want to test O in a new position, say position 4.

Similarly, S at position 3 is new.

M at position 5 is new.

So ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.

We can do better.

What about ""MOSSY""? 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)

So not.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.

Let me try: 
- Put M at position 4? 
- Put O at position 1? 
- Put S at position 2? 

Word: O ? S ? M ? 

But we need two more letters.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.

Not working.

Put O at position 1 and M at position 3? 
Word: O ? M ? S

Example: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 3 and M at position 2? 
Word: ? M O ? ?

With S.

Example: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.

""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.

""GMOCH"" -> not a word.

This is hard.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.

But O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)
- Position 2: ? (same)
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

And the word must be valid.

What letters for positions 1 and 2?

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: _ _ M O S

What words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""IOM"" -> too short.

""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.

""LI MOS"" -> not a word.

""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: _ _ M O S

With U? 

Example: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I think we are missing a word.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't because the forbidden positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

For example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: some letter (say B) 
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: some letter (say P)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

So the word: B M P O S

Is that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.

""BLUMS"" -> not common.

""GLUMS"" -> not common.

""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.

""KUMUS"" -> not common.

Not.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- M at position 2: allowed.
- O at position 4: allowed.
- S at position 5: allowed.

But what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.

""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.

Wait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.

""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let's accept it? Or better, find another.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.

But we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.

So for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.
O at 1,3,4,5.
S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?

For example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.

For example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""LOUMS"" -> not common.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> Y, U, M, B, S -> 
- Position 1: Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: S

Now, check constraints:
- M: position 3 -> allowed (since not 1)
- O: not present? But we need O. We have O? ""YUMBS"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

""DOUSY"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Another word: ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes accepted as a variant of ""mossy"", but it has O at 2? ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.

Let's think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.

Let me list possible words:

- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.

- ""MOSBY"": not a word.

- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.

- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.

- ""MODOS"" -> not common.

- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.

- ""MOIST"" we already tried.

We tried ""moist"".

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.

Word: [letter1] [letter2] M O S

What words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""UMOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UMPS"" -> U, M, P, S -> but no O? We need O.

We must have O.

Another word: ""BOOMS"" -> B, O, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - 1: B
  - 2: O -> forbidden (O cannot be at 2)
  - 3: O -> but we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have two O's? 
  - 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed)
  - 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed)

But O at 2 and 3: we know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 might be correct? But we don't know.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""BOOMS"", we have O at 2 and 3. We know O at 2 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.

But we are guessing to get information.

But we are forced to use a word that has O at 2? We cannot.

We need a word that does not put O at 2.

So let's try to put O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUMA"" -> too short.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

""OXBOW"" -> no S.

Not.

Put O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> no M.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> no O.

Not.

Put O at position 4.

Word: _ _ _ O _

With M and S.

Example: ""BO O S"" -> not 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> E and R forbidden.

""LOXES"" -> E and X? X is allowed, but E forbidden.

""PODOS"" -> not common.

""SOCCER"" -> C and E forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 5.

Word: _ _ _ _ O

With M and S.

Example: ""BIKES"" -> E forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""PODGY"" -> no S.

""SOUPY"": S, O, U, P, Y -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong.

So we avoid.

""SOUPY"" has O at 2: forbidden.

""SOUPS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOFAS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 or 5 or M at 2,3,4,5 and S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try: M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? Then positions 1 and 3.

Word: [letter1] [letter3] M O S

What words? ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMOS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 3, O at 4, S at 1? 

Word: S _ M O _ 

But then we need two more letters.

Example: ""S K M O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K M O P"" -> not a word.

"" S K U M P"" -> not.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
- Position 1: S -> S can be at 1? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 1)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 4)
- Position 5: P

But does it have O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another word: ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Perhaps we should consider that the secret word might have M at 3, O at 5, S at 2? 

Word: _ S _ _ M

But we need O.

""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> A forbidden.

""USHER"" -> E and R forbidden.

Not.

""USQUE"" -> E forbidden.

Not.

""USURY"" -> U, S, U, R, Y -> R forbidden.

Not.

""USUAL"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S and two other letters from the allowed set.

Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: 
- ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden) -> no.

- ""MOULD"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

- ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""POUMS"" -> not common.

- ""YUMBS"" -> no O.

- ""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I found one: ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Another: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 and S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ O _

With M.

Example: ""S K U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O P"" -> not.

"" S H U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S H U O P"" -> ""SHUOP"" not a word.

"" S P O O L"" -> ""SPOOL"" -> S, P, O, O, L -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed (S can be at 1)
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: O -> but S is at 1, and O at 3 and 4? 
- Position 5: L

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.

But we also have S at 1, which is allowed.

And M is missing? We need M.

So ""SPOOL"" has no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We should avoid putting S at 4.

In ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.

But we have to include M.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? 

Word: S M O ? ?

With two letters.

Example: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed
- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: Y

This seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.

And it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.

Check forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.

Also, positions:
- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)
- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)
- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)

And we test G and Y.

So this seems good.

Another option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.

""MOGUL"" -> no S.

""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don't know about position 1. So we can test it.
- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.
- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
- Position 4: G -> new letter.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

This will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.
- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.
- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.

And we learn about G and Y.

So I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Or ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

So I'll go with ""SMOGY"".

But let's see if there is a word with U.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

I think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.

So my guess is ""SMOGY"".

But note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1, M at 2.

We also test G and Y.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.

The secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. 

For the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.

<guess>smog</guess>",smog,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation of ""moist"" feedback:
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".
- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

So, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.
Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

We also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:
- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).
- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).
- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).

We have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).

Additionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.

We also have positional constraints for M, O, S:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these.

Let's think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words? We can brainstorm:

We know the word has M, O, S. Let's list possible positions for them:

We have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.

So for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
S cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Some words that come to mind:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.
- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? 
- ""SHOMA"": Not common.

We need valid English words.

Another idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.

Avoid I.

What about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.

We must avoid forbidden letters.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S's, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don't have information about duplicates.

We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But let's consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. It might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.

What about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. 

We need S.

Another word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.

Avoid T.

What about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.

""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.

""POSH"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.

We must include S.

What about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words with M, O, S.

Possible words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it's 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.
- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.
- ""SOLEM"": not a word.

We need to use allowed letters.

Another word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.

What about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y's. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.

Also, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":
- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.

In ""Mousy"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.

But in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.

We should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.

In ""Mousy"":
- M is at 1 -> we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.

Let me try to rearrange:

We know:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

So for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.

Also, we have two more letters to include.

What about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.

We need S.

Another word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.

We need O.

What about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.

""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.

""POSH"": too short.

This is tricky.

What about ""SHOMA""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S's. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.

We should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.

Similarly for O and S.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOULD"": but no S.
- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. 
  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). 
  - Positions: 
    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don't gain new information about M's position.

We want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.

Similarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.

So for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).

We need a word where:
- M is not at position 1
- O is not at position 2
- S is not at position 4

And the word must be valid.

What about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.

We need M and S.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""SHOMA"": not common.

""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.

We need M.

What about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.

""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.

This is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.

Words with M, O, S and ending with them? 

Another word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? 

""SOLEM"" -> not common.

What about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let's see the positions in ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M's position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? 
- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.
  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.

We should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.

In ""BOMBS"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn anything new about O's position.

We want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.

Similarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).

For S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

So let's try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.

For example:
- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need to fill with O and S and two other letters.

What about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: W
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)
  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)

So ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.

Another word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.

What about ""LOUSY"": but no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""BOYSY"": no M.

What about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.
- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? 
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S's position? And we use a forbidden position.

We should avoid that.

So we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.

Let me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need O and S.

Example: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.

""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.

""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

This is challenging.

Another word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don't test a new position.

We need to test O in a new position. Let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S inside.

For example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.

""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.

""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.

Not working.

What about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.

Word: S _ _ _ _

With M and O.

Example: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

""SHOMA"" -> not common.

""SKIMS"" -> no O.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.

Another word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)

So not.

What about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.

We need to include M.

What about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let's try to find a better one.

Perhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

We need S.

What about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

Perhaps we should use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.

""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.

""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.

Not working.

What about M at position 3?

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.

We need to avoid O at 2.

So let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

Not working.

Perhaps O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.

We need M.

""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.

We need S.

""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.
- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

Another common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

But let's see: 
- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)
- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)

So ""BOSOM"" has:
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn the position of O.

We want to test O in a new position, say position 4.

Similarly, S at position 3 is new.

M at position 5 is new.

So ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.

We can do better.

What about ""MOSSY""? 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)

So not.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.

Let me try: 
- Put M at position 4? 
- Put O at position 1? 
- Put S at position 2? 

Word: O ? S ? M ? 

But we need two more letters.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.

Not working.

Put O at position 1 and M at position 3? 
Word: O ? M ? S

Example: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 3 and M at position 2? 
Word: ? M O ? ?

With S.

Example: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.

""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.

""GMOCH"" -> not a word.

This is hard.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.

But O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)
- Position 2: ? (same)
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

And the word must be valid.

What letters for positions 1 and 2?

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: _ _ M O S

What words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""IOM"" -> too short.

""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.

""LI MOS"" -> not a word.

""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: _ _ M O S

With U? 

Example: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I think we are missing a word.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't because the forbidden positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

For example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: some letter (say B) 
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: some letter (say P)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

So the word: B M P O S

Is that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.

""BLUMS"" -> not common.

""GLUMS"" -> not common.

""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.

""KUMUS"" -> not common.

Not.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- M at position 2: allowed.
- O at position 4: allowed.
- S at position 5: allowed.

But what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.

""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.

Wait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.

""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let's accept it? Or better, find another.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.

But we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.

So for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.
O at 1,3,4,5.
S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?

For example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.

For example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""LOUMS"" -> not common.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> Y, U, M, B, S -> 
- Position 1: Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: S

Now, check constraints:
- M: position 3 -> allowed (since not 1)
- O: not present? But we need O. We have O? ""YUMBS"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

""DOUSY"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Another word: ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes accepted as a variant of ""mossy"", but it has O at 2? ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.

Let's think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.

Let me list possible words:

- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.

- ""MOSBY"": not a word.

- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.

- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.

- ""MODOS"" -> not common.

- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.

- ""MOIST"" we already tried.

We tried ""moist"".

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.

Word: [letter1] [letter2] M O S

What words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""UMOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UMPS"" -> U, M, P, S -> but no O? We need O.

We must have O.

Another word: ""BOOMS"" -> B, O, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - 1: B
  - 2: O -> forbidden (O cannot be at 2)
  - 3: O -> but we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have two O's? 
  - 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed)
  - 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed)

But O at 2 and 3: we know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 might be correct? But we don't know.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""BOOMS"", we have O at 2 and 3. We know O at 2 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.

But we are guessing to get information.

But we are forced to use a word that has O at 2? We cannot.

We need a word that does not put O at 2.

So let's try to put O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUMA"" -> too short.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

""OXBOW"" -> no S.

Not.

Put O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> no M.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> no O.

Not.

Put O at position 4.

Word: _ _ _ O _

With M and S.

Example: ""BO O S"" -> not 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> E and R forbidden.

""LOXES"" -> E and X? X is allowed, but E forbidden.

""PODOS"" -> not common.

""SOCCER"" -> C and E forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 5.

Word: _ _ _ _ O

With M and S.

Example: ""BIKES"" -> E forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""PODGY"" -> no S.

""SOUPY"": S, O, U, P, Y -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong.

So we avoid.

""SOUPY"" has O at 2: forbidden.

""SOUPS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOFAS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 or 5 or M at 2,3,4,5 and S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try: M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? Then positions 1 and 3.

Word: [letter1] [letter3] M O S

What words? ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMOS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 3, O at 4, S at 1? 

Word: S _ M O _ 

But then we need two more letters.

Example: ""S K M O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K M O P"" -> not a word.

"" S K U M P"" -> not.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
- Position 1: S -> S can be at 1? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 1)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 4)
- Position 5: P

But does it have O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another word: ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Perhaps we should consider that the secret word might have M at 3, O at 5, S at 2? 

Word: _ S _ _ M

But we need O.

""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> A forbidden.

""USHER"" -> E and R forbidden.

Not.

""USQUE"" -> E forbidden.

Not.

""USURY"" -> U, S, U, R, Y -> R forbidden.

Not.

""USUAL"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S and two other letters from the allowed set.

Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: 
- ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden) -> no.

- ""MOULD"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

- ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""POUMS"" -> not common.

- ""YUMBS"" -> no O.

- ""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I found one: ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Another: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 and S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ O _

With M.

Example: ""S K U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O P"" -> not.

"" S H U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S H U O P"" -> ""SHUOP"" not a word.

"" S P O O L"" -> ""SPOOL"" -> S, P, O, O, L -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed (S can be at 1)
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: O -> but S is at 1, and O at 3 and 4? 
- Position 5: L

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.

But we also have S at 1, which is allowed.

And M is missing? We need M.

So ""SPOOL"" has no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We should avoid putting S at 4.

In ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.

But we have to include M.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? 

Word: S M O ? ?

With two letters.

Example: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed
- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: Y

This seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.

And it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.

Check forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.

Also, positions:
- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)
- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)
- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)

And we test G and Y.

So this seems good.

Another option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.

""MOGUL"" -> no S.

""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don't know about position 1. So we can test it.
- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.
- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
- Position 4: G -> new letter.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

This will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.
- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.
- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.

And we learn about G and Y.

So I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Or ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

So I'll go with ""SMOGY"".

But let's see if there is a word with U.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

I think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.

So my guess is ""SMOGY"".

But note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1, M at 2.

We also test G and Y.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.

The secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. 

For the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.",Guess 3: smog -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let's try to pick a word with other common letters.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.

 Let me try to form a word: 
 We can try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.

 However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". 

 Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.

 Let's look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""PULLY"" but that has two L's and Y? Let's avoid less common letters.

 Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So, let's list some words without these letters:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U, etc.

 Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.

 Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. 

 We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? 

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.

 But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me think of words that have U. We haven't tested U. But we can test U later.

 Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That's also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn't have any of the forbidden letters.

 Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.

 However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. 

 But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.

 So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

 However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven't tested O.

 Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

 We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". 

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.

 So, my next guess: ""MOIST""

 But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.
- It's a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>moist</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation of ""moist"" feedback:
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".
- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

So, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.
Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

We also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:
- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).
- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).
- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).

We have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).

Additionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.

We also have positional constraints for M, O, S:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these.

Let's think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words? We can brainstorm:

We know the word has M, O, S. Let's list possible positions for them:

We have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.

So for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
S cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Some words that come to mind:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.
- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? 
- ""SHOMA"": Not common.

We need valid English words.

Another idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.

Avoid I.

What about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.

We must avoid forbidden letters.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S's, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don't have information about duplicates.

We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But let's consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. It might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.

What about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. 

We need S.

Another word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.

Avoid T.

What about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.

""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.

""POSH"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.

We must include S.

What about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words with M, O, S.

Possible words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it's 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.
- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.
- ""SOLEM"": not a word.

We need to use allowed letters.

Another word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.

What about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y's. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.

Also, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":
- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.

In ""Mousy"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.

But in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.

We should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.

In ""Mousy"":
- M is at 1 -> we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.

Let me try to rearrange:

We know:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

So for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.

Also, we have two more letters to include.

What about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.

We need S.

Another word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.

We need O.

What about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.

""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.

""POSH"": too short.

This is tricky.

What about ""SHOMA""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S's. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.

We should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.

Similarly for O and S.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOULD"": but no S.
- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. 
  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). 
  - Positions: 
    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don't gain new information about M's position.

We want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.

Similarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.

So for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).

We need a word where:
- M is not at position 1
- O is not at position 2
- S is not at position 4

And the word must be valid.

What about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.

We need M and S.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""SHOMA"": not common.

""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.

We need M.

What about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.

""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.

This is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.

Words with M, O, S and ending with them? 

Another word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? 

""SOLEM"" -> not common.

What about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let's see the positions in ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M's position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? 
- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.
  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.

We should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.

In ""BOMBS"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn anything new about O's position.

We want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.

Similarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).

For S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

So let's try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.

For example:
- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need to fill with O and S and two other letters.

What about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: W
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)
  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)

So ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.

Another word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.

What about ""LOUSY"": but no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""BOYSY"": no M.

What about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.
- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? 
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S's position? And we use a forbidden position.

We should avoid that.

So we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.

Let me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need O and S.

Example: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.

""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.

""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

This is challenging.

Another word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don't test a new position.

We need to test O in a new position. Let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S inside.

For example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.

""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.

""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.

Not working.

What about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.

Word: S _ _ _ _

With M and O.

Example: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

""SHOMA"" -> not common.

""SKIMS"" -> no O.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.

Another word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)

So not.

What about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.

We need to include M.

What about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let's try to find a better one.

Perhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

We need S.

What about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

Perhaps we should use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.

""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.

""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.

Not working.

What about M at position 3?

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.

We need to avoid O at 2.

So let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

Not working.

Perhaps O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.

We need M.

""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.

We need S.

""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.
- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

Another common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

But let's see: 
- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)
- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)

So ""BOSOM"" has:
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn the position of O.

We want to test O in a new position, say position 4.

Similarly, S at position 3 is new.

M at position 5 is new.

So ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.

We can do better.

What about ""MOSSY""? 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)

So not.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.

Let me try: 
- Put M at position 4? 
- Put O at position 1? 
- Put S at position 2? 

Word: O ? S ? M ? 

But we need two more letters.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.

Not working.

Put O at position 1 and M at position 3? 
Word: O ? M ? S

Example: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 3 and M at position 2? 
Word: ? M O ? ?

With S.

Example: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.

""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.

""GMOCH"" -> not a word.

This is hard.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.

But O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)
- Position 2: ? (same)
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

And the word must be valid.

What letters for positions 1 and 2?

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: _ _ M O S

What words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""IOM"" -> too short.

""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.

""LI MOS"" -> not a word.

""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: _ _ M O S

With U? 

Example: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I think we are missing a word.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't because the forbidden positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

For example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: some letter (say B) 
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: some letter (say P)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

So the word: B M P O S

Is that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.

""BLUMS"" -> not common.

""GLUMS"" -> not common.

""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.

""KUMUS"" -> not common.

Not.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- M at position 2: allowed.
- O at position 4: allowed.
- S at position 5: allowed.

But what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.

""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.

Wait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.

""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let's accept it? Or better, find another.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.

But we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.

So for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.
O at 1,3,4,5.
S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?

For example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.

For example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""LOUMS"" -> not common.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> Y, U, M, B, S -> 
- Position 1: Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: S

Now, check constraints:
- M: position 3 -> allowed (since not 1)
- O: not present? But we need O. We have O? ""YUMBS"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

""DOUSY"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Another word: ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes accepted as a variant of ""mossy"", but it has O at 2? ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.

Let's think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.

Let me list possible words:

- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.

- ""MOSBY"": not a word.

- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.

- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.

- ""MODOS"" -> not common.

- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.

- ""MOIST"" we already tried.

We tried ""moist"".

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.

Word: [letter1] [letter2] M O S

What words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""UMOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UMPS"" -> U, M, P, S -> but no O? We need O.

We must have O.

Another word: ""BOOMS"" -> B, O, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - 1: B
  - 2: O -> forbidden (O cannot be at 2)
  - 3: O -> but we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have two O's? 
  - 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed)
  - 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed)

But O at 2 and 3: we know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 might be correct? But we don't know.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""BOOMS"", we have O at 2 and 3. We know O at 2 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.

But we are guessing to get information.

But we are forced to use a word that has O at 2? We cannot.

We need a word that does not put O at 2.

So let's try to put O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUMA"" -> too short.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

""OXBOW"" -> no S.

Not.

Put O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> no M.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> no O.

Not.

Put O at position 4.

Word: _ _ _ O _

With M and S.

Example: ""BO O S"" -> not 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> E and R forbidden.

""LOXES"" -> E and X? X is allowed, but E forbidden.

""PODOS"" -> not common.

""SOCCER"" -> C and E forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 5.

Word: _ _ _ _ O

With M and S.

Example: ""BIKES"" -> E forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""PODGY"" -> no S.

""SOUPY"": S, O, U, P, Y -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong.

So we avoid.

""SOUPY"" has O at 2: forbidden.

""SOUPS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOFAS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 or 5 or M at 2,3,4,5 and S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try: M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? Then positions 1 and 3.

Word: [letter1] [letter3] M O S

What words? ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMOS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 3, O at 4, S at 1? 

Word: S _ M O _ 

But then we need two more letters.

Example: ""S K M O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K M O P"" -> not a word.

"" S K U M P"" -> not.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
- Position 1: S -> S can be at 1? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 1)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 4)
- Position 5: P

But does it have O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another word: ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Perhaps we should consider that the secret word might have M at 3, O at 5, S at 2? 

Word: _ S _ _ M

But we need O.

""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> A forbidden.

""USHER"" -> E and R forbidden.

Not.

""USQUE"" -> E forbidden.

Not.

""USURY"" -> U, S, U, R, Y -> R forbidden.

Not.

""USUAL"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S and two other letters from the allowed set.

Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: 
- ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden) -> no.

- ""MOULD"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

- ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""POUMS"" -> not common.

- ""YUMBS"" -> no O.

- ""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I found one: ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Another: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 and S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ O _

With M.

Example: ""S K U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O P"" -> not.

"" S H U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S H U O P"" -> ""SHUOP"" not a word.

"" S P O O L"" -> ""SPOOL"" -> S, P, O, O, L -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed (S can be at 1)
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: O -> but S is at 1, and O at 3 and 4? 
- Position 5: L

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.

But we also have S at 1, which is allowed.

And M is missing? We need M.

So ""SPOOL"" has no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We should avoid putting S at 4.

In ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.

But we have to include M.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? 

Word: S M O ? ?

With two letters.

Example: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed
- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: Y

This seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.

And it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.

Check forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.

Also, positions:
- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)
- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)
- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)

And we test G and Y.

So this seems good.

Another option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.

""MOGUL"" -> no S.

""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don't know about position 1. So we can test it.
- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.
- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
- Position 4: G -> new letter.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

This will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.
- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.
- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.

And we learn about G and Y.

So I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Or ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

So I'll go with ""SMOGY"".

But let's see if there is a word with U.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

I think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.

So my guess is ""SMOGY"".

But note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1, M at 2.

We also test G and Y.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.

The secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. 

For the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.

But O is a vowel and we have it.\n\n Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.\n\n However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". \n\n Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.\n\n Let\'s look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and none are in the forbidden set.\n\n Alternatively, ""PULLY"" but that has two L\'s and Y? Let\'s avoid less common letters.\n\n Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, let\'s list some words without these letters:\n\n - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U, etc.\n\n Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.\n\n However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.\n\n Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. \n\n We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? \n\n Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, let me think of words that have U. We haven\'t tested U. But we can test U later.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.\n\n So, I will go with ""MOIST"".\n\n But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That\'s also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn\'t have any of the forbidden letters.\n\n Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.\n\n However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. \n\n But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).\n\n Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.\n\n So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven\'t tested O.\n\n Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\n We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". \n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.\n\n I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""MOIST""\n\n But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. \n\nI considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.\n- It\'s a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n\nInterpretation of ""moist"" feedback:\n- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with -).\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".\n- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).\n- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.\nLetters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n\nWe also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:\n- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).\n- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).\n- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).\n\nAdditionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.\n\nForbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.\n\nWe also have positional constraints for M, O, S:\n- M cannot be in position 1.\n- O cannot be in position 2.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that satisfies these.\n\nLet\'s think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.\n\nPossible words? We can brainstorm:\n\nWe know the word has M, O, S. Let\'s list possible positions for them:\n\nWe have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.\n\nSo for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.\nSimilarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.\nS cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.\n- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? \n- ""SHOMA"": Not common.\n\nWe need valid English words.\n\nAnother idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.\n\nAvoid I.\n\nWhat about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.\n\nWe must avoid forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But in feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates. However, it\'s possible. But let\'s see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S\'s, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don\'t have information about duplicates.\n\nWe should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. It might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.\n\nWhat about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. \n\nWe need S.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.\n\nAvoid T.\n\nWhat about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.\n\nWe must have M.\n\nPerhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.\n\n""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.\n\n""POSH"": too short.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.\n\n""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\nWhat about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.\n\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.\n\nWe need a word with M, O, S.\n\nLet me search for words with M, O, S.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it\'s 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.\n- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.\n- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.\n- ""SOLEM"": not a word.\n\nWe need to use allowed letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.\n\nWhat about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y\'s. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.\n\nAlso, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":\n- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.\n\nIn ""Mousy"":\n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.\n\nBut in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.\n\nWe should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.\n\nIn ""Mousy"":\n- M is at 1 -> we know it\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nWe need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.\n\nLet me try to rearrange:\n\nWe know:\n- M cannot be in position 1.\n- O cannot be in position 2.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to include.\n\nWhat about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.\n\n""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.\n\nWe need S.\n\nAnother word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.\n\nWe need O.\n\nWhat about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.\n\n""POSH"": too short.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nWhat about ""SHOMA""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S\'s. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":\n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.\n\nWe should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for O and S.\n\nLet me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""MOULD"": but no S.\n- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. \n  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). \n  - Positions: \n    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don\'t gain new information about M\'s position.\n\nWe want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.\n\nSimilarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.\n\nSo for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).\n\nWe need a word where:\n- M is not at position 1\n- O is not at position 2\n- S is not at position 4\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWhat about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.\n\nWe need M and S.\n\nAnother word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n\n""SHOMA"": not common.\n\n""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nWhat about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.\n\nWords with M, O, S and ending with them? \n\nAnother word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? \n\n""SOLEM"" -> not common.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let\'s see the positions in ""MOSSY"":\n- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M\'s position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.\n\nPerhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? \n- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.\n  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.\n\nWe should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.\n\nIn ""BOMBS"":\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t learn anything new about O\'s position.\n\nWe want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).\n\nFor S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.\n\nFor example:\n- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWe need to fill with O and S and two other letters.\n\nWhat about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> \n- Positions: \n  - Position 1: W\n  - Position 2: H\n  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)\n  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.\n  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)\n\nSo ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.\n\nWhat about ""LOUSY"": but no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n\n""BOYSY"": no M.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> \n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.\n- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.\n- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? \n- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S\'s position? And we use a forbidden position.\n\nWe should avoid that.\n\nSo we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.\n\nLet me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWe need O and S.\n\nExample: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\n""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.\n\n""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""GUIMP"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t test a new position.\n\nWe need to test O in a new position. Let\'s try O at position 1.\n\nWord: O _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and S inside.\n\nFor example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.\n\n""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.\n\n""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.\n\nNot working.\n\nWhat about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.\n\nWord: S _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and O.\n\nExample: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.\n\n""SHOMA"" -> not common.\n\n""SKIMS"" -> no O.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> \n- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)\n- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)\n\nSo not.\n\nWhat about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.\n\nWe need to include M.\n\nWhat about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.\n\n""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.\n\nI recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let\'s try to find a better one.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nWe need S.\n\nWhat about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\nPerhaps we should use a word that doesn\'t have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.\n\nLet me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWith O and S.\n\nExample: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.\n\n""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.\n\nNot working.\n\nWhat about M at position 3?\n\nWord: ? ? M ? ?\n\nWith O and S.\n\nExample: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.\n\nWe need to avoid O at 2.\n\nSo let\'s try O at position 1.\n\nWord: O _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.\n\n""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OUPHE"" -> not common.\n\nNot working.\n\nPerhaps O at position 3.\n\nWord: _ _ O _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.\n\nWe need M.\n\n""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.\n\nWe need S.\n\n""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.\n\nWe need a word with M, O, S.\n\nLet me search for words that have M, O, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.\n- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.\n- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.\n\nAnother common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> \n- Positions: \n  - Position 1: B\n  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.\n\nBut let\'s see: \n- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)\n- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)\n- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)\n\nSo ""BOSOM"" has:\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t learn the position of O.\n\nWe want to test O in a new position, say position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 3 is new.\n\nM at position 5 is new.\n\nSo ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? \n- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)\n- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.\n\nLet me try: \n- Put M at position 4? \n- Put O at position 1? \n- Put S at position 2? \n\nWord: O ? S ? M ? \n\nBut we need two more letters.\n\nExample: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.\n\n""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.\n\nNot working.\n\nPut O at position 1 and M at position 3? \nWord: O ? M ? S\n\nExample: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\nPut O at position 3 and M at position 2? \nWord: ? M O ? ?\n\nWith S.\n\nExample: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""GMOCH"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have U.\n\nWord: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.\n\nBut O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).\n\nSo positions: \n- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)\n- Position 2: ? (same)\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: O\n- Position 5: S\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWhat letters for positions 1 and 2?\n\nWe can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word of the form: _ _ M O S\n\nWhat words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.\n\n""DEMO"" -> too short.\n\n""IOM"" -> too short.\n\n""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""LI MOS"" -> not a word.\n\n""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have U.\n\nWord: _ _ M O S\n\nWith U? \n\nExample: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\nI think we are missing a word.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nWe need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can\'t because the forbidden positions are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nFor example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).\n\nSo positions: \n- Position 1: some letter (say B) \n- Position 2: M\n- Position 3: some letter (say P)\n- Position 4: O\n- Position 5: S\n\nSo the word: B M P O S\n\nIs that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.\n\n""BLUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""GLUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""KUMUS"" -> not common.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nFor example:\n- M at position 2: allowed.\n- O at position 4: allowed.\n- S at position 5: allowed.\n\nBut what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\nI recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nWe are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.\n\nWait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.\n\n""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let\'s accept it? Or better, find another.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.\n\nBut we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.\n\nSo for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.\nO at 1,3,4,5.\nS at 1,2,3,5.\n\nLet me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?\n\nFor example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.\n\nFor example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? ?

""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.\n\nLet\'s think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.\n\nForbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.\n\nSo available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.\n\n- ""MOSBY"": not a word.\n\n- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.\n\n- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.\n\n- ""MODOS"" -> not common.\n\n- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.\n\n- ""MOIST"" we already tried.\n\nWe tried ""moist"".\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can\'t.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.\n\nWord: [letter1] [letter2] M O S\n\nWhat words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""UM M O S"" -> not.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5?

Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.\n\nBut we are guessing to get information.\n\nBut we are forced to use a word that has O at 2?

We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.\n\nBut we also have S at 1, which is allowed.\n\nAnd M is missing? We need M.\n\nSo ""SPOOL"" has no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nAnother word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)\n- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.\n\nWe should avoid putting S at 4.\n\nIn ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.\n\nBut we have to include M.\n\nAnother word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.\n\nLet me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? \n\nWord: S M O ? ?\n\nWith two letters.\n\nExample: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.\n\n"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> \n- Position 1: S -> allowed\n- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)\n- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.\n\nAnd it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.\n\nCheck forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. \n- S: allowed\n- M: allowed\n- O: allowed\n- G: allowed\n- Y: allowed\n\nAnd forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.\n\nSo ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.\n\nAlso, positions:\n- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)\n- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)\n- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)\n\nAnd we test G and Y.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.\n\n""MOGUL"" -> no S.\n\n""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don\'t know about position 1. So we can test it.\n- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.\n- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n- Position 4: G -> new letter.\n- Position 5: Y -> new letter.\n\nThis will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.\n- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.\n- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.\n\nAnd we learn about G and Y.\n\nSo I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nOr ""BOUMS"" -> not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SMOGY"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with U.\n\nWord: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nI think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo my guess is ""SMOGY"".\n\nBut note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n\nSimilarly, S at 1, M at 2.\n\nWe also test G and Y.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.\n\nThe secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. \n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:\n- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).\n- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.\n\n<guess>smog</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: smog -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""smog"": 
  Model answer is not five letters.

This indicates that ""smog"" is not a valid 5-letter word. Therefore, the previous guess ""moist"" was valid but the secret word is not ""moist"". We must choose a new guess that is a valid 5-letter word.

Recall the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- Guess 2: ""moist"" had M, O, S present but in wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T absent.
- Guess 3: ""smog"" was invalid (not five letters).

So the secret word:
- Contains M, O, S (from guess 2).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- M is not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes M, O, S (since they are in the word, and we need to find their correct positions).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- Puts M, O, S in positions that are allowed: M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

We also need to include two new letters to test.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and M, O, S are already included).

We have to form a word with M, O, S and two from the above.

Possible words? Let's think.

We know the word has M, O, S. We need to test new positions for them.

Possible positions:
- M: can be at 2,3,4,5 (not 1)
- O: can be at 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
- S: can be at 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

We also need two more letters.

Let me try to find words that fit.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5. 
We need to fill the first two positions.

What words start with two letters and then ""MOS""? 
- ""UM M O S"" -> not, because ""UMOS"" is not a word.
- ""BO M O S"" -> ""BOMOS"" not a word.

Word: _ _ _ O M -> but then O at 4, M at 5? But S needs to be placed? 
We have to include S.

Word: _ _ S O M -> "" S O M"" at the end? ""SOM"" is 3 letters.

We need S at 1,2,3, or 5, O at 3,4,5, M at 2,3,4,5.

Try S at 1 and O at 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 2? Then ""S M O _ _""

What words? ""SMO"" at the beginning: ""SMO"" is not 5 letters.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" but we tried that and it was invalid because not five letters? No, ""smog"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMOKY"" is a word? Yes, but we have O at position 3? And we need O at position 4? Conflict.

If we put O at 4: then S _ _ O _

With M at 2: ""S M ? O ?""

What? ""S M O P Y"" -> ""S MOPY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" is 5 letters? ""smog"" is 4, but ""smog"" is 4, so ""smogy"" is not a word.

"" S M O L L"" -> ""SMOLE"" not a word.

"" S M O V Y"" -> ""SMOVY"" not a word.

Not.

Put O at 5: then S _ _ _ O

With M at 2: ""S M ? ? O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O C E"" -> C and E forbidden.

"" S M U D O"" -> not a word.

"" S M O K O"" -> duplicate O? And not a word.

Put O at 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 2: ""S M O _ _""

Example: ""S M O P S"" -> ""S M O P S"" is ""slops"" but that has L and P, and S at the end? But we have S at 1 and 5? Duplicate S? 
- ""SLOPS"" -> S, L, O, P, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: S

But we have S at 5? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, M is missing? We need M.

We need M.

"" S L O P S"" -> ""SLOPS"" has no M.

We need M.

"" S K U M P"" -> ""SKUMP"" not a word.

"" S H U M P"" -> ""SHUMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: U
  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: P

But we need O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to include O.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> but O cannot be at position 2! We know O is not at position 2 from ""moist"" feedback. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We must avoid O at position 2.

In ""SOMBS"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 1: S O _ _ _

With M at 3? Then ""S O M _ _""

Example: ""S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden (O not at 2)
  - Position 3: M -> M can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: B
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 5)

But O at 2 is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 4? Then ""S _ O M _""

Example: ""S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> but no O? ""SLUMP"" is S, L, U, M, P -> no O.

We need O.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

"" S K O M B"" -> ""SKOMB"" not a word.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> same issue, no O.

We need O.

"" S U M A R"" -> A and R forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 5? Then ""S _ _ O M""

Example: ""S L O O M"" -> ""SLOOM"" not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> ""SKUOM"" not a word.

"" S H U O M"" -> ""SHUOM"" not a word.

"" S P U O M"" -> ""SPUOM"" not a word.

"" S L U M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has U, but no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 5.

S _ _ _ O

With M at 2? Then ""S M ? ? O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O D O"" -> duplicate O? And ""SMODO"" not a word.

"" S M O V O"" -> duplicate O, and ""SMVO"" not.

"" S M U D O"" -> ""SMUDO"" not a word.

"" S M O K O"" -> duplicate O, and ""SMKO"" not.

Not.

M at 3: S _ M _ O

Example: ""S L I M O"" -> I forbidden.

"" S U B M O"" -> ""SUBMO"" not a word.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

Not.

O at 5: S _ _ _ O

With M at 4? Then ""S _ _ M O""

Example: ""S L A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S U B M O"" -> ""SUBMO"" not a word.

"" S P A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think we have to consider that the word might have U or other letters.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O F T S"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O F T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O U P Y"" -> ""SOUPY"" -> S, O, U, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden! O cannot be at position 2.

So avoid.

"" S O U P Y"" has O at 2: forbidden.

"" S O U F Y"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""M O S A Y"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 1 and S at position 5, with M at 2? 

Word: O _ M _ S -> ""O _ M _ S""

Example: ""O P M U S"" -> ""OPMUS"" not a word.

"" O D M U S"" -> ""ODMUS"" not a word.

"" O V M U S"" -> ""OVUMS"" not a word.

"" O K M U S"" -> ""OKMUS"" not.

Not.

O at 1 and S at 3: ""O _ S _ _""

With M at 4? ""O _ S M _""

Example: ""O P S M Y"" -> ""OPSMY"" not a word.

"" O L S M P"" -> ""OLSMP"" not.

"" O H S M Y"" -> ""OHSMY"" not.

Not.

O at 1 and S at 5: ""O _ _ _ S""

With M at 3? ""O _ M _ S""

Example: ""O P M O S"" -> ""OPMOS"" not a word.

"" O L M O S"" -> ""OLMOS"" not.

"" O D M O S"" -> ""ODMOS"" not.

"" O V M O S"" -> ""OVMOs"" not.

Not.

O at 3: _ _ O _ _

With M at 1? But M cannot be at 1. So we cannot put M at 1.

We must avoid M at 1.

So O at 3: _ _ O _ _

With M at 4? Then "" _ _ O M _""

With S at 1? Then ""S _ O M _""

Example: ""S U O M Y"" -> ""SUOMY"" not a word.

"" S L O M Y"" -> ""SLOMY"" not a word.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

Not.

S at 1 and O at 4: S _ O _ O -> but O at 5? ""S _ O _ O""

Example: ""S L O D O"" -> ""SLODO"" not a word.

"" S K O L O"" -> ""SKOLO"" not.

All have duplicate O.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

We can try ""SLOSH"" but no M.

I think we have to use a word with duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and avoid the forbidden positions.

Let me try: put M at 4, O at 5, S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ M O

With O at 5? Then positions 1: S, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: M, 5: O.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and one of them is duplicated? Or we have to use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, S at 4, but we can have other duplicates.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Perhaps ""M O S S Y"" -> duplicate S and Y? ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and we have to put O at 5.

S at 1: _ S _ _ O

With M at 3? ""S M _ _ O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S M O L L"" -> no O.

We need O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Not.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMGY"" not 5 letters.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMKY"" not.

"" S M O P Y"" -> ""S M O P Y"" is 5 letters? ""S MOPY"" -> S, M, O, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2? And S at 1.

This seems promising: ""S M O P Y""

But is ""S M O P Y"" a word? ""Smopy"" is not a standard word. I think ""smoky"" is a word, but ""smopy"" is not.

"" Smog"" is 4 letters.

"" Smoky"" is 5 letters: S, M, O, K, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: K
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But in ""smoky"", we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But we also have K and Y.

And forbidden letters: S, M, O, K, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- K: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""smoky"" is a valid word.

But let's check the positions:
- M is at position 2: which is allowed (since M not forbidden at 2)
- O is at position 3: which is allowed (O not forbidden at 3)
- S is at position 1: which is allowed (S not forbidden at 1)

And we test K and Y.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""S O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But let's see if there is a word with M at 4 or 5.

For example, O at 4 and S at 1: S _ _ O _

With M at 5: ""S _ _ O M""

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.

What about ""S L U O M"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> not.

"" S H U O M"" -> not.

"" S P U O M"" -> not.

"" S L O O M"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O B O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLOPY"" not.

"" S L O B Y"" -> ""SLBY"" not.

"" S L O E N"" -> E and N forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O H A"" -> A forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O P S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O B S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O W Y"" -> ""SLOWY"" not.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLPY"" not.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

Another word: ""M O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But in ""smoky"", we have:
- S at 1: allowed
- M at 2: allowed
- O at 3: allowed
- K at 4
- Y at 5

And we avoid forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""smoky"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: we know M is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. We hope to get feedback on whether it's correct or not.
- O: at position 3, which is new.
- S: at position 1, which is new.

We also test K and Y.

So this is a good guess.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" but T is forbidden.

No.

So I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""smoky"", we have O at position 3. We know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1 and M at 2.

We also get to test K and Y.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, and S are present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3: smog** → Invalid (not five letters).

The secret word must:
- Contain M, O, and S (from Guess 2).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- Satisfy position constraints: M cannot be at position 1, O cannot be at position 2, S cannot be at position 4.

For the next guess, I chose **""smoky""** because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (K and Y) to gather more information.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of M, O, S and check for K and Y.

<guess>smoky</guess>",smoky,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""smog"": 
  Model answer is not five letters.

This indicates that ""smog"" is not a valid 5-letter word. Therefore, the previous guess ""moist"" was valid but the secret word is not ""moist"". We must choose a new guess that is a valid 5-letter word.

Recall the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- Guess 2: ""moist"" had M, O, S present but in wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T absent.
- Guess 3: ""smog"" was invalid (not five letters).

So the secret word:
- Contains M, O, S (from guess 2).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- M is not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes M, O, S (since they are in the word, and we need to find their correct positions).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- Puts M, O, S in positions that are allowed: M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

We also need to include two new letters to test.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and M, O, S are already included).

We have to form a word with M, O, S and two from the above.

Possible words? Let's think.

We know the word has M, O, S. We need to test new positions for them.

Possible positions:
- M: can be at 2,3,4,5 (not 1)
- O: can be at 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
- S: can be at 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

We also need two more letters.

Let me try to find words that fit.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5. 
We need to fill the first two positions.

What words start with two letters and then ""MOS""? 
- ""UM M O S"" -> not, because ""UMOS"" is not a word.
- ""BO M O S"" -> ""BOMOS"" not a word.

Word: _ _ _ O M -> but then O at 4, M at 5? But S needs to be placed? 
We have to include S.

Word: _ _ S O M -> "" S O M"" at the end? ""SOM"" is 3 letters.

We need S at 1,2,3, or 5, O at 3,4,5, M at 2,3,4,5.

Try S at 1 and O at 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 2? Then ""S M O _ _""

What words? ""SMO"" at the beginning: ""SMO"" is not 5 letters.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" but we tried that and it was invalid because not five letters? No, ""smog"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMOKY"" is a word? Yes, but we have O at position 3? And we need O at position 4? Conflict.

If we put O at 4: then S _ _ O _

With M at 2: ""S M ? O ?""

What? ""S M O P Y"" -> ""S MOPY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" is 5 letters? ""smog"" is 4, but ""smog"" is 4, so ""smogy"" is not a word.

"" S M O L L"" -> ""SMOLE"" not a word.

"" S M O V Y"" -> ""SMOVY"" not a word.

Not.

Put O at 5: then S _ _ _ O

With M at 2: ""S M ? ? O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O C E"" -> C and E forbidden.

"" S M U D O"" -> not a word.

"" S M O K O"" -> duplicate O? And not a word.

Put O at 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 2: ""S M O _ _""

Example: ""S M O P S"" -> ""S M O P S"" is ""slops"" but that has L and P, and S at the end? But we have S at 1 and 5? Duplicate S? 
- ""SLOPS"" -> S, L, O, P, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: S

But we have S at 5? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, M is missing? We need M.

We need M.

"" S L O P S"" -> ""SLOPS"" has no M.

We need M.

"" S K U M P"" -> ""SKUMP"" not a word.

"" S H U M P"" -> ""SHUMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: U
  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: P

But we need O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to include O.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> but O cannot be at position 2! We know O is not at position 2 from ""moist"" feedback. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We must avoid O at position 2.

In ""SOMBS"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 1: S O _ _ _

With M at 3? Then ""S O M _ _""

Example: ""S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden (O not at 2)
  - Position 3: M -> M can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: B
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 5)

But O at 2 is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 4? Then ""S _ O M _""

Example: ""S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> but no O? ""SLUMP"" is S, L, U, M, P -> no O.

We need O.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

"" S K O M B"" -> ""SKOMB"" not a word.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> same issue, no O.

We need O.

"" S U M A R"" -> A and R forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 5? Then ""S _ _ O M""

Example: ""S L O O M"" -> ""SLOOM"" not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> ""SKUOM"" not a word.

"" S H U O M"" -> ""SHUOM"" not a word.

"" S P U O M"" -> ""SPUOM"" not a word.

"" S L U M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has U, but no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 5.

S _ _ _ O

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

Example: ""S L A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S U B M O"" -> ""SUBMO"" not a word.

"" S P A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think we have to consider that the word might have U or other letters.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O F T S"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O F T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O U P Y"" -> ""SOUPY"" -> S, O, U, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden! O cannot be at position 2.

So avoid.

"" S O U P Y"" has O at 2: forbidden.

"" S O U F Y"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""M O S A Y"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 1 and S at position 5, with M at 2? 

Word: O _ M _ S -> ""O _ M _ S""

Example: ""O P M U S"" -> ""OPMUS"" not a word.

O at 3: _ _ O _ _

We must avoid M at 1.

So O at 3: _ _ O _ _

All have duplicate O.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

We can try ""SLOSH"" but no M.

I think we have to use a word with duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and avoid the forbidden positions.

Let me try: put M at 4, O at 5, S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ M O

With O at 5? Then positions 1: S, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: M, 5: O.

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with allowed letters.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and we have to put O at 4 or 5 or M at 3,4,5 and S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try: O at 4, S at 1, M at 3? 

Word: S _ M O _

We need O.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> no O.

"" S L O P S"" -> duplicate S and no M.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and one of them is duplicated? Or we have to use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, S at 4, but we can have other duplicates.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Perhaps ""M O S S Y"" -> duplicate S and Y? ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

"" M O S S Y"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

We need to put M at 2,3,4,5.

How about M at 4, O at 5, S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ M O

Not.

Perhaps ""D O M B S"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

Not.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and we have to put O at 5.

S at 1: _ S _ _ O

With M at 3? ""S M _ _ O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O D O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O K O"" -> ""SMKO"" not.

"" S M O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S M O L L"" -> no O.

We need O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Not.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMGY"" not 5 letters.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMKY"" not.

"" S M O P Y"" -> ""S M O P Y"" is 5 letters? ""S MOPY"" -> S, M, O, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2? And S at 1.

This seems promising: ""S M O P Y""

But is ""S M O P Y"" a word? ""Smopy"" is not a standard word. I think ""smoky"" is a word, but ""smopy"" is not.

"" Smog"" is 4 letters.

"" Smoky"" is 5 letters: S, M, O, K, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: K
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But in ""smoky"", we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But we also have K and Y.

And forbidden letters: S, M, O, K, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- K: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""smoky"" is a valid word.

But let's check the positions:
- M is at position 2: which is allowed (since M not forbidden at 2)
- O is at position 3: which is allowed (O not forbidden at 3)
- S is at position 1: which is allowed (S not forbidden at 1)

And we test K and Y.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""S O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But let's see if there is a word with M at 4 or 5.

For example, O at 4 and S at 1: S _ _ O _

With M at 5: ""S _ _ O M""

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.

What about ""S L U O M"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> not.

"" S H U O M"" -> not.

"" S P U O M"" -> not.

"" S L O O M"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O B O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLOPY"" not.

"" S L O B Y"" -> ""SLBY"" not.

"" S L O E N"" -> E and N forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O H A"" -> A forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O P S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O B S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O W Y"" -> ""SLOWY"" not.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLPY"" not.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

Another word: ""M O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But in ""smoky"", we have:
- S at 1: allowed
- M at 2: allowed
- O at 3: allowed
- K at 4
- Y at 5

And we avoid forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""smoky"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: we know M is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. We hope to get feedback on whether it's correct or not.
- O: at position 3, which is new.
- S: at position 1, which is new.

We also test K and Y.

So this is a good guess.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" but T is forbidden.

No.

So I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""smoky"", we have O at position 3. We know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1 and M at 2.

We also get to test K and Y.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, and S are present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3: smog** → Invalid (not five letters).

The secret word must:
- Contain M, O, and S (from Guess 2).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- Satisfy position constraints: M cannot be at position 1, O cannot be at position 2, S cannot be at position 4.

For the next guess, I chose **""smoky""** because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (K and Y) to gather more information.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of M, O, S and check for K and Y.",Guess 4: smoky -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) K(x) Y(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)
 Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let's try to pick a word with other common letters.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.

 Let me try to form a word: 
 We can try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.

 However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". 

 Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.

 Let's look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and none are in the forbidden set.

 Alternatively, ""PULLY"" but that has two L's and Y? Let's avoid less common letters.

 Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 So, let's list some words without these letters:

 - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven't tried O, I, U, etc.

 Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.

 Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. 

 We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? 

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.

 But note: we don't know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.

 Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 However, let me think of words that have U. We haven't tested U. But we can test U later.

 Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.

 So, I will go with ""MOIST"".

 But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That's also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn't have any of the forbidden letters.

 Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.

 However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. 

 But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.

 So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.

 However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven't tested O.

 Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.

 We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". 

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.

 I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.

 So, my next guess: ""MOIST""

 But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don't know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.

 Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. 

I considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.
- It's a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.

This guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.

<guess>moist</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.
2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)

Interpretation of ""moist"" feedback:
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked with -).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- I is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".
- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E.

So, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.
Letters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

We also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:
- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).
- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).
- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).

We have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).
- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).

Additionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.

Forbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.

We also have positional constraints for M, O, S:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

We need to choose a word that satisfies these.

Let's think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.

Possible words? We can brainstorm:

We know the word has M, O, S. Let's list possible positions for them:

We have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.

So for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.
Similarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
S cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.

We also have two more letters to include.

Let me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Some words that come to mind:
- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.
- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? 
- ""SHOMA"": Not common.

We need valid English words.

Another idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.

Avoid I.

What about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.

We must avoid forbidden letters.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. But in feedback, we haven't seen duplicates. However, it's possible. But let's see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S's, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don't have information about duplicates.

We should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.

But let's consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S's. But we don't know if the secret word has two S's. It might be inefficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.

What about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. 

We need S.

Another word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.

Avoid T.

What about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.

""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.

""POSH"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

Another idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.

We must include S.

What about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words with M, O, S.

Possible words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it's 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.
- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.
- ""SOLEM"": not a word.

We need to use allowed letters.

Another word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.

What about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y's. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.

Also, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":
- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.

In ""Mousy"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.

But in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.

We should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.

In ""Mousy"":
- M is at 1 -> we know it's wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

We need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.

Let me try to rearrange:

We know:
- M cannot be in position 1.
- O cannot be in position 2.
- S cannot be in position 4.

So for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.

Also, we have two more letters to include.

What about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.

""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.

We need S.

Another word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.

We need O.

What about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.

""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.

""POSH"": too short.

This is tricky.

What about ""SHOMA""? Not common.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S's. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.

We should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.

Similarly for O and S.

Let me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.

Possible words:
- ""MOULD"": but no S.
- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. 
  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). 
  - Positions: 
    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don't gain new information about M's position.

We want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.

Similarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.

So for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).

We need a word where:
- M is not at position 1
- O is not at position 2
- S is not at position 4

And the word must be valid.

What about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.

We need M and S.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""SHOMA"": not common.

""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.

We need M.

What about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.

""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.

""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.

This is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.

Words with M, O, S and ending with them? 

Another word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? 

""SOLEM"" -> not common.

What about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let's see the positions in ""MOSSY"":
- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M's position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.

But we don't know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.

Perhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? 
- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.
  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.

We should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.

In ""BOMBS"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn anything new about O's position.

We want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.

Similarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).

For S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

So let's try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.

For example:
- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need to fill with O and S and two other letters.

What about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: W
  - Position 2: H
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)
  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)

So ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.

Another word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.

What about ""LOUSY"": but no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

""BOYSY"": no M.

What about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.
- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? 
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S's position? And we use a forbidden position.

We should avoid that.

So we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.

Let me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

We need O and S.

Example: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.

""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.

""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.

""GUIMP"" -> not a word.

This is challenging.

Another word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don't test a new position.

We need to test O in a new position. Let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S inside.

For example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.

""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.

""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.

Not working.

What about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.

Word: S _ _ _ _

With M and O.

Example: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

""SHOMA"" -> not common.

""SKIMS"" -> no O.

I think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.

Another word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)

So not.

What about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.

We need to include M.

What about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.

""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let's try to find a better one.

Perhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

We need S.

What about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

Perhaps we should use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.

Word: ? M ? ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.

""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.

""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.

Not working.

What about M at position 3?

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? 
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.

We need to avoid O at 2.

So let's try O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

Not working.

Perhaps O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.

We need M.

""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.

We need S.

""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.

We need a word with M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S.

Common words: 
- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.
- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.
- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

Another common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> 
- Positions: 
  - Position 1: B
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

But let's see: 
- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)
- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)

So ""BOSOM"" has:
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don't learn the position of O.

We want to test O in a new position, say position 4.

Similarly, S at position 3 is new.

M at position 5 is new.

So ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.

We can do better.

What about ""MOSSY""? 
- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)
- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)

So not.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.

Let me try: 
- Put M at position 4? 
- Put O at position 1? 
- Put S at position 2? 

Word: O ? S ? M ? 

But we need two more letters.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.

Not working.

Put O at position 1 and M at position 3? 
Word: O ? M ? S

Example: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.

""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.

""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 3 and M at position 2? 
Word: ? M O ? ?

With S.

Example: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.

""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.

""GMOCH"" -> not a word.

This is hard.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.

But O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)
- Position 2: ? (same)
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

And the word must be valid.

What letters for positions 1 and 2?

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word of the form: _ _ M O S

What words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""IOM"" -> too short.

""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.

""LI MOS"" -> not a word.

""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.

No.

Another word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might have U.

Word: _ _ M O S

With U? 

Example: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I think we are missing a word.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't because the forbidden positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.

For example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).

So positions: 
- Position 1: some letter (say B) 
- Position 2: M
- Position 3: some letter (say P)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: S

So the word: B M P O S

Is that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.

""BLUMS"" -> not common.

""GLUMS"" -> not common.

""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.

""KUMUS"" -> not common.

Not.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- M at position 2: allowed.
- O at position 4: allowed.
- S at position 5: allowed.

But what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.

""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.

Wait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.

""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.

Perhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let's accept it? Or better, find another.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.

But we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.

So for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.
O at 1,3,4,5.
S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?

For example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.

For example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.

Word: ? ? M ? ?

With O and S.

Example: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""LOUMS"" -> not common.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> Y, U, M, B, S -> 
- Position 1: Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: S

Now, check constraints:
- M: position 3 -> allowed (since not 1)
- O: not present? But we need O. We have O? ""YUMBS"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

""DOUSY"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" -> but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Another word: ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes accepted as a variant of ""mossy"", but it has O at 2? ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.

Let's think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.

Let me list possible words:

- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.

- ""MOSBY"": not a word.

- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.

- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.

- ""MODOS"" -> not common.

- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.

- ""MOIST"" we already tried.

We tried ""moist"".

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can't.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

For example:
- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.

Word: [letter1] [letter2] M O S

What words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""UMOS"" is not 5 letters.

""UMPS"" -> U, M, P, S -> but no O? We need O.

We must have O.

Another word: ""BOOMS"" -> B, O, O, M, S -> 
- Positions: 
  - 1: B
  - 2: O -> forbidden (O cannot be at 2)
  - 3: O -> but we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have two O's? 
  - 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed)
  - 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed)

But O at 2 and 3: we know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 might be correct? But we don't know.

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""BOOMS"", we have O at 2 and 3. We know O at 2 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.

But we are guessing to get information.

But we are forced to use a word that has O at 2? We cannot.

We need a word that does not put O at 2.

So let's try to put O at position 1.

Word: O _ _ _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""OASIS"" -> A forbidden.

""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUMA"" -> too short.

""OUMAS"" -> not common.

""OUPHE"" -> not common.

""OXBOW"" -> no S.

Not.

Put O at position 3.

Word: _ _ O _ _

With M and S.

Example: ""BLOBS"" -> no M.

""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.

""DEMO"" -> too short.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""POUMS"" -> not common.

""YUMBS"" -> no O.

Not.

Put O at position 4.

Word: _ _ _ O _

With M and S.

Example: ""BO O S"" -> not 5 letters.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> E and R forbidden.

""LOXES"" -> E and X? X is allowed, but E forbidden.

""PODOS"" -> not common.

""SOCCER"" -> C and E forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 5.

Word: _ _ _ _ O

With M and S.

Example: ""BIKES"" -> E forbidden.

""JUMPS"" -> no O.

""PODGY"" -> no S.

""SOUPY"": S, O, U, P, Y -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong.

So we avoid.

""SOUPY"" has O at 2: forbidden.

""SOUPS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOFAS"" -> S at 1, O at 2: O at 2 forbidden.

Not.

""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 or 5 or M at 2,3,4,5 and S at 1,2,3,5.

Let me try: M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? Then positions 1 and 3.

Word: [letter1] [letter3] M O S

What words? ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MUMOS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 3, O at 4, S at 1? 

Word: S _ M O _ 

But then we need two more letters.

Example: ""S K M O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K M O P"" -> not a word.

"" S K U M P"" -> not.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
- Position 1: S -> S can be at 1? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 1)
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 4)
- Position 5: P

But does it have O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

Another word: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.

I think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.

We must have M.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" is the only one that comes to mind, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

Another word: ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Perhaps we should consider that the secret word might have M at 3, O at 5, S at 2? 

Word: _ S _ _ M

But we need O.

""USUAL"" -> U, S, U, A, L -> A forbidden.

""USHER"" -> E and R forbidden.

Not.

""USQUE"" -> E forbidden.

Not.

""USURY"" -> U, S, U, R, Y -> R forbidden.

Not.

""USUAL"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me search for words that have M, O, S and two other letters from the allowed set.

Allowed letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words: 
- ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden) -> no.

- ""MOULD"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2 -> no.

- ""LOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

- ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

- ""POUMS"" -> not common.

- ""YUMBS"" -> no O.

- ""JUMPS"" -> no O.

I found one: ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1, O at 2: forbidden.

Another: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.

Perhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put O at 4 and S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ O _

With M.

Example: ""S K U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O P"" -> not.

"" S H U O L"" -> not a word.

"" S H U O P"" -> ""SHUOP"" not a word.

"" S P O O L"" -> ""SPOOL"" -> S, P, O, O, L -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed (S can be at 1)
- Position 2: P
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: O -> but S is at 1, and O at 3 and 4? 
- Position 5: L

But we have two O's? The secret word might have two O's? We don't know.

But in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.

But we also have S at 1, which is allowed.

And M is missing? We need M.

So ""SPOOL"" has no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We should avoid putting S at 4.

In ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.

But we have to include M.

Another word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.

Let me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? 

Word: S M O ? ?

With two letters.

Example: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> 
- Position 1: S -> allowed
- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)
- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: Y

This seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.

And it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.

Check forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- G: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.

Also, positions:
- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)
- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)
- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)

And we test G and Y.

So this seems good.

Another option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.

""MOGUL"" -> no S.

""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.

But let's confirm the positions:
- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don't know about position 1. So we can test it.
- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.
- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.
- Position 4: G -> new letter.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

This will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.

If we get feedback:
- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.
- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.
- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.

And we learn about G and Y.

So I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.

Another word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.

Or ""BOUMS"" -> not common.

So I'll go with ""SMOGY"".

But let's see if there is a word with U.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.

""UMIAC"" -> no S.

I think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.

So my guess is ""SMOGY"".

But note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1, M at 2.

We also test G and Y.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.
- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.

The secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. 

For the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.

<guess>smog</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)
Guess 3: smog -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the third guess ""smog"": 
  Model answer is not five letters.

This indicates that ""smog"" is not a valid 5-letter word. Therefore, the previous guess ""moist"" was valid but the secret word is not ""moist"". We must choose a new guess that is a valid 5-letter word.

Recall the feedback from previous guesses:
- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).
- Guess 2: ""moist"" had M, O, S present but in wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T absent.
- Guess 3: ""smog"" was invalid (not five letters).

So the secret word:
- Contains M, O, S (from guess 2).
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- M is not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes M, O, S (since they are in the word, and we need to find their correct positions).
- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.
- Puts M, O, S in positions that are allowed: M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.

We also need to include two new letters to test.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and M, O, S are already included).

We have to form a word with M, O, S and two from the above.

Possible words? Let's think.

We know the word has M, O, S. We need to test new positions for them.

Possible positions:
- M: can be at 2,3,4,5 (not 1)
- O: can be at 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
- S: can be at 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

We also need two more letters.

Let me try to find words that fit.

Word: _ _ M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5. 
We need to fill the first two positions.

What words start with two letters and then ""MOS""? 
- ""UM M O S"" -> not, because ""UMOS"" is not a word.
- ""BO M O S"" -> ""BOMOS"" not a word.

Word: _ _ _ O M -> but then O at 4, M at 5? But S needs to be placed? 
We have to include S.

Word: _ _ S O M -> "" S O M"" at the end? ""SOM"" is 3 letters.

We need S at 1,2,3, or 5, O at 3,4,5, M at 2,3,4,5.

Try S at 1 and O at 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 2? Then ""S M O _ _""

What words? ""SMO"" at the beginning: ""SMO"" is not 5 letters.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" but we tried that and it was invalid because not five letters? No, ""smog"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMOKY"" is a word? Yes, but we have O at position 3? And we need O at position 4? Conflict.

If we put O at 4: then S _ _ O _

With M at 2: ""S M ? O ?""

What? ""S M O P Y"" -> ""S MOPY"" not a word.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" is 5 letters? ""smog"" is 4, but ""smog"" is 4, so ""smogy"" is not a word.

"" S M O L L"" -> ""SMOLE"" not a word.

"" S M O V Y"" -> ""SMOVY"" not a word.

Not.

Put O at 5: then S _ _ _ O

With M at 2: ""S M ? ? O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O C E"" -> C and E forbidden.

"" S M U D O"" -> not a word.

"" S M O K O"" -> duplicate O? And not a word.

Put O at 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 2: ""S M O _ _""

Example: ""S M O P S"" -> ""S M O P S"" is ""slops"" but that has L and P, and S at the end? But we have S at 1 and 5? Duplicate S? 
- ""SLOPS"" -> S, L, O, P, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: S

But we have S at 5? And we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. Also, M is missing? We need M.

We need M.

"" S L O P S"" -> ""SLOPS"" has no M.

We need M.

"" S K U M P"" -> ""SKUMP"" not a word.

"" S H U M P"" -> ""SHUMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> S, L, U, M, P -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: L
  - Position 3: U
  - Position 4: M
  - Position 5: P

But we need O? ""SLUMP"" has no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to include O.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> but O cannot be at position 2! We know O is not at position 2 from ""moist"" feedback. So if we put O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.

We must avoid O at position 2.

In ""SOMBS"", O is at position 2, which is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 1: S O _ _ _

With M at 3? Then ""S O M _ _""

Example: ""S O M B S"" -> ""SOMBS"" -> S, O, M, B, S -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden (O not at 2)
  - Position 3: M -> M can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: B
  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed, since S not forbidden at 5)

But O at 2 is forbidden.

So not.

Put O at position 3: S _ O _ _

With M at 4? Then ""S _ O M _""

Example: ""S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" -> but no O? ""SLUMP"" is S, L, U, M, P -> no O.

We need O.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

"" S K O M B"" -> ""SKOMB"" not a word.

"" S H O M P"" -> ""SHOMP"" not common.

"" S P O M P"" -> ""SPOMP"" not a word.

"" S L O M P"" -> same issue, no O.

We need O.

"" S U M A R"" -> A and R forbidden.

Not.

Put O at position 4: S _ _ O _

With M at 5? Then ""S _ _ O M""

Example: ""S L O O M"" -> ""SLOOM"" not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> ""SKUOM"" not a word.

"" S H U O M"" -> ""SHUOM"" not a word.

"" S P U O M"" -> ""SPUOM"" not a word.

"" S L U M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has U, but no O.

We need O.

"" S L O P S"" -> no M.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 5.

S _ _ _ O

With M at 2? Then ""S M ? ? O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O D O"" -> duplicate O? And ""SMODO"" not a word.

"" S M O V O"" -> duplicate O, and ""SMVO"" not.

"" S M U D O"" -> ""SMUDO"" not a word.

"" S M O K O"" -> duplicate O, and ""SMKO"" not.

Not.

M at 3: S _ M _ O

Example: ""S L I M O"" -> I forbidden.

"" S U B M O"" -> ""SUBMO"" not a word.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

Not.

O at 5: S _ _ _ O

With M at 4? Then ""S _ _ M O""

Example: ""S L A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S U B M O"" -> ""SUBMO"" not a word.

"" S P A M O"" -> A forbidden.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think we have to consider that the word might have U or other letters.

Another word: ""S O L D S"" -> ""SOLDS"" not a word.

"" S O F T S"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O F T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S O U P Y"" -> ""SOUPY"" -> S, O, U, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: O -> forbidden! O cannot be at position 2.

So avoid.

"" S O U P Y"" has O at 2: forbidden.

"" S O U F Y"" -> O at 2: forbidden.

Not.

Perhaps ""M O S A Y"" -> A forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has O at position 1 and S at position 5, with M at 2? 

Word: O _ M _ S -> ""O _ M _ S""

Example: ""O P M U S"" -> ""OPMUS"" not a word.

"" O D M U S"" -> ""ODMUS"" not a word.

"" O V M U S"" -> ""OVUMS"" not a word.

"" O K M U S"" -> ""OKMUS"" not.

Not.

O at 1 and S at 3: ""O _ S _ _""

With M at 4? ""O _ S M _""

Example: ""O P S M Y"" -> ""OPSMY"" not a word.

"" O L S M P"" -> ""OLSMP"" not.

"" O H S M Y"" -> ""OHSMY"" not.

Not.

O at 1 and S at 5: ""O _ _ _ S""

With M at 3? ""O _ M _ S""

Example: ""O P M O S"" -> ""OPMOS"" not a word.

"" O L M O S"" -> ""OLMOS"" not.

"" O D M O S"" -> ""ODMOS"" not.

"" O V M O S"" -> ""OVMOs"" not.

Not.

O at 3: _ _ O _ _

With M at 1? But M cannot be at 1. So we cannot put M at 1.

We must avoid M at 1.

So O at 3: _ _ O _ _

With M at 4? Then "" _ _ O M _""

With S at 1? Then ""S _ O M _""

Example: ""S U O M Y"" -> ""SUOMY"" not a word.

"" S L O M Y"" -> ""SLOMY"" not a word.

"" S C O M B"" -> C forbidden.

Not.

S at 1 and O at 4: S _ O _ O -> but O at 5? ""S _ O _ O""

Example: ""S L O D O"" -> ""SLODO"" not a word.

"" S K O L O"" -> ""SKOLO"" not.

"" S H O P O"" -> ""SHOPO"" not.

I think we have to use a word with duplicate letters? But we don't know.

Another word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.

Perhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.

We are running out of options.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and avoid the forbidden positions.

Let me try: put M at 4, O at 5, S at 1? 

Word: S _ _ M O

With O at 5? Then positions 1: S, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: M, 5: O.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and one of them is duplicated? Or we have to use a word that doesn't have M at 1, O at 2, S at 4, but we can have other duplicates.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Perhaps ""M O S S Y"" -> duplicate S and Y? ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.

Another word: ""M O S T Y"" -> T forbidden.

I think we have to use a word that has M, O, S and we have to put O at 5.

S at 1: _ S _ _ O

With M at 3? ""S M _ _ O""

Example: ""S M A R O"" -> A and R forbidden.

"" S M O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

"" S M O L L"" -> no O.

We need O.

"" S M O T Y"" -> T forbidden.

Not.

"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMGY"" not 5 letters.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""SMKY"" not.

"" S M O P Y"" -> ""S M O P Y"" is 5 letters? ""S MOPY"" -> S, M, O, P, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)
  - Position 4: P
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2? And S at 1.

This seems promising: ""S M O P Y""

But is ""S M O P Y"" a word? ""Smopy"" is not a standard word. I think ""smoky"" is a word, but ""smopy"" is not.

"" Smog"" is 4 letters.

"" Smoky"" is 5 letters: S, M, O, K, Y -> 
  - Position 1: S
  - Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed)
  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)
  - Position 4: K
  - Position 5: Y

But we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But in ""smoky"", we have O at 3 and M at 2.

And S at 1.

But we also have K and Y.

And forbidden letters: S, M, O, K, Y. 
- S: allowed
- M: allowed
- O: allowed
- K: allowed
- Y: allowed

And forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.

So ""smoky"" is a valid word.

But let's check the positions:
- M is at position 2: which is allowed (since M not forbidden at 2)
- O is at position 3: which is allowed (O not forbidden at 3)
- S is at position 1: which is allowed (S not forbidden at 1)

And we test K and Y.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""S O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But let's see if there is a word with M at 4 or 5.

For example, O at 4 and S at 1: S _ _ O _

With M at 5: ""S _ _ O M""

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.

What about ""S L U O M"" -> not a word.

"" S K U O M"" -> not.

"" S H U O M"" -> not.

"" S P U O M"" -> not.

"" S L O O M"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O B O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O V O"" -> duplicate O.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLOPY"" not.

"" S L O B Y"" -> ""SLBY"" not.

"" S L O E N"" -> E and N forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O H A"" -> A forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O P S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O B S"" -> duplicate S.

"" S L O I C"" -> I and C forbidden.

Not.

"" S L O W Y"" -> ""SLOWY"" not.

"" S L O P Y"" -> ""SLPY"" not.

"" S L O M P"" -> ""SLUMP"" has no O.

I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

Another word: ""M O K Y"" -> too short.

"" S M O K Y"" -> ""S M O K Y"" is 5 letters? ""smoky"" is 5 letters.

"" Smoky"" is a valid word.

We can use ""smoky"".

But in ""smoky"", we have:
- S at 1: allowed
- M at 2: allowed
- O at 3: allowed
- K at 4
- Y at 5

And we avoid forbidden letters.

So I'll go with ""smoky"".

But let's confirm: 
- M: we know M is in the word, and we are putting it at position 2. We hope to get feedback on whether it's correct or not.
- O: at position 3, which is new.
- S: at position 1, which is new.

We also test K and Y.

So this is a good guess.

Perhaps ""M O S T Y"" but T is forbidden.

No.

So I think ""smoky"" is a good choice.

But note: in ""smoky"", we have O at position 3. We know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.

Similarly, S at 1 and M at 2.

We also get to test K and Y.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, and S are present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3: smog** → Invalid (not five letters).

The secret word must:
- Contain M, O, and S (from Guess 2).
- Exclude C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).
- Satisfy position constraints: M cannot be at position 1, O cannot be at position 2, S cannot be at position 4.

For the next guess, I chose **""smoky""** because:
- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).
- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (K and Y) to gather more information.
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the correct positions of M, O, S and check for K and Y.

We can consider other vowels and consonants.\n Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out)\n Consonants: We have many left, such as B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.\n\n Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.\n\n However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let\'s try to pick a word with other common letters.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.\n\n Let me try to form a word: \n We can try ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.\n\n Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.\n\n However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". \n\n Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters but has Y which is less common.\n\n Let\'s look for words without the forbidden letters and with common letters.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T. All are common and none are in the forbidden set.\n\n Alternatively, ""PULLY"" but that has two L\'s and Y? Let\'s avoid less common letters.\n\n Another option: ""LUMPS"" or ""DUTCH"", but DUTCH has D, U, T, C, H -> but C is forbidden! So we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, let\'s list some words without these letters:\n\n - Using common letters: S, T, L, O, M, P, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a valid and common word: M, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" : P, I, O, U, S.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels. We haven\'t tried O, I, U, etc.\n\n Another word: ""SHOUT"" -> S, H, O, U, T.\n\n However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T, which are all common.\n\n Let me check if there are any other words that might cover more ground. \n\n We could also consider ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but G and H are less common than S and T? \n\n Alternatively, ""STOMP"" : S, T, O, M, P -> but we have O and then M and P.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has any of these. We are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\n Another word: ""LYMPH"" but that has Y and H, and L, M, P.\n\n I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.\n\n However, let me think of words that have U. We haven\'t tested U. But we can test U later.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""OUIJA"" but that is not common and has A (which is forbidden) and J is not very common.\n\n So, I will go with ""MOIST"".\n\n But wait, what about ""SPLIT""? S, P, L, I, T. That\'s also good. However, we have to avoid E and A, and SPLIT doesn\'t have any of the forbidden letters.\n\n Similarly, ""SLOTH"" is also an option.\n\n However, I think ""SPLIT"" is better because it has S, P, L, I, T. \n\n But note: we want to avoid the forbidden letters. Both ""MOIST"" and ""SPLIT"" are valid.\n\n Let me choose ""SPLIT"". It has two consonants that are common: S, P, L, T, and I (a vowel).\n\n Alternatively, ""POINT"" is not allowed because it has N (forbidden) and O? But N is forbidden so we cannot use N.\n\n So, ""SPLIT"" is acceptable.\n\n However, I recall that ""STOMP"" is a common word and uses S, T, O, M, P. But O is a vowel and we haven\'t tested O.\n\n Since we have no vowels from the first guess (A and E are out), we should test other vowels. The remaining vowels are I, O, U.\n\n We can test O in ""STOMP"" or in ""MOIST"". \n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can test O in a later guess if needed.\n\n I think either is fine. Let me go with ""MOIST"" because it tests M, O, I, S, T.\n\n So, my next guess: ""MOIST""\n\n But wait, what if the word has double letters? We don\'t know. But we are avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""MOIST"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new common letters. \n\nI considered words like ""split"" and ""stomp"" but chose **""moist""** because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not in the forbidden set (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It includes two vowels (O, I) and three consonants (M, S, T), maximizing information.\n- It\'s a valid English word that avoids repeating letters.\n\nThis guess will help identify if any of these letters exist in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" -> all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n2. ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\n\nInterpretation of ""moist"" feedback:\n- M is in the word but in the wrong position (since it\'s marked with -).\n- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- I is not in the word (x).\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n\nTherefore, we know:\n- The secret word contains M, O, and S, but none of them are in the positions they were guessed in ""moist"".\n- The secret word does not contain I or T (since they were marked x).\n- Additionally, from the first guess, we know it doesn\'t contain C, R, A, N, E.\n\nSo, letters that must be in the word: M, O, S.\nLetters that are not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n\nWe also know the positions in ""moist"" where M, O, S cannot be:\n- M cannot be in position 1 (since it was guessed there and is wrong position).\n- O cannot be in position 2 (guessed there and wrong position).\n- S cannot be in position 4 (guessed there and wrong position).\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our third guess.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains M, O, S (since they are present in the secret word).\n- Does not contain C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n- The letters M, O, S must not be placed in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively (because in ""moist"", M was in position 1, O in position 2, S in position 4, and they were marked as wrong position, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions).\n\nAdditionally, we have two more letters to guess (since the word is 5 letters) which must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden ones.\n\nForbidden letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: M, O, S are already known to be in the word, so we must include them. The other two letters must be from the available set and not in the forbidden list.\n\nWe also have positional constraints for M, O, S:\n- M cannot be in position 1.\n- O cannot be in position 2.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that satisfies these.\n\nLet\'s think of words that contain M, O, S and two other letters from the available set.\n\nPossible words? We can brainstorm:\n\nWe know the word has M, O, S. Let\'s list possible positions for them:\n\nWe have 5 positions. We need to place M, O, S in positions that are not forbidden for them, and the other two letters in any position not forbidden.\n\nBut note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us which positions are correct, only that they are present but misplaced.\n\nSo for M: it cannot be in position 1. So it can be in 2,3,4,5.\nSimilarly, O cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.\nS cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,3,5.\n\nWe also have two more letters to include.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have M, O, S and two other letters (from B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y. But does it have M? No, we need M. So not.\n- ""MOSHY"": Not a word? \n- ""SHOMA"": Not common.\n\nWe need valid English words.\n\nAnother idea: ""SOLID"" -> S, O, L, I, D. But I is forbidden (from guess 2, I is x). So cannot use I.\n\nAvoid I.\n\nWhat about ""SOLAR""? But A and R are forbidden.\n\nWe must avoid forbidden letters.\n\nLet me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""MOSSY"": M, O, S, S, Y -> but has two S\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But in feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicates. However, it\'s possible. But let\'s see: ""moist"" had S in position 4 and it was marked wrong position. If the word had two S\'s, then the S in position 4 might be correct if there is another S elsewhere? But in ""moist"", we only had one S. So the secret word might have only one S? We don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""moist"" showed S as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it might have more? However, we don\'t have information about duplicates.\n\nWe should avoid assuming duplicates unless necessary.\n\nBut let\'s consider: if we use ""MOSSY"", it has two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. It might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word with M, O, S and two new letters.\n\nWhat about ""GHOUL""? G, H, O, U, L -> but O is in position 3? And we have O and S? ""ghoul"" has no S. \n\nWe need S.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T -> but T is forbidden (from guess 2: T is x). So cannot use T.\n\nAvoid T.\n\nWhat about ""LOUSY"": L, O, U, S, Y -> but no M. So not.\n\nWe must have M.\n\nPerhaps ""MUSIC"": M, U, S, I, C -> but I and C are forbidden. No.\n\n""DOZEN"": D, O, Z, E, N -> E and N are forbidden. No.\n\n""POSH"": too short.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHOWY"": S, H, O, W, Y -> no M.\n\n""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> but no S. We need S.\n\nWe must include S.\n\nWhat about ""FOCUS"": F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden. No.\n\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> this has M, O? No, O is missing. We need O.\n\nWe need a word with M, O, S.\n\nLet me search for words with M, O, S.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""MOSaic"" -> but A is forbidden and it\'s 5 letters? ""MOSAIC"" has A and I, which are forbidden.\n- ""MOSHY"" -> not a valid word.\n- ""LOSING"": L, O, S, I, N -> I and N are forbidden. No.\n- ""SOLEM"": not a word.\n\nWe need to use allowed letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BOYSY"": B, O, Y, S, Y -> has S and O, but no M. And Y repeated? Also, we need M.\n\nWhat about ""Mousy"": M, O, U, S, Y -> this has M, O, S and two Y\'s. And letters: M, O, U, S, Y. Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed (we know they are in the word), U and Y are not forbidden (forbidden are C,R,A,N,E,I,T). So U and Y are allowed.\n\nAlso, positions: in ""moist"", M was in position 1 (wrong), O in 2 (wrong), S in 4 (wrong). So for ""Mousy"":\n- M is in position 1: but in the secret word, M is not in position 1 (because in ""moist"" position 1 M was wrong). So if we put M in position 1, it would be wrong again? But we are trying to find where they are correct.\n\nIn ""Mousy"":\n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not in position 1 from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for ""moist"" said M is in the word but not in position 1. So in the secret word, M is present but not at position 1. Therefore, if we guess ""Mousy"", we must not put M at position 1.\n\nBut in ""Mousy"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect for the secret word. So if we guess it, we might get M marked as wrong position again? But we already know M is not at position 1. So it would be a waste? We want to test new positions.\n\nWe should avoid putting M at position 1, O at position 2, and S at position 4.\n\nIn ""Mousy"":\n- M is at 1 -> we know it\'s wrong, so we shouldn\'t do that.\n\nWe need a word that has M, O, S but in different positions.\n\nLet me try to rearrange:\n\nWe know:\n- M cannot be in position 1.\n- O cannot be in position 2.\n- S cannot be in position 4.\n\nSo for the next guess, we should try M, O, S in other positions.\n\nAlso, we have two more letters to include.\n\nWhat about ""SOLID""? S, O, L, I, D -> I is forbidden. No.\n\n""MOULD"": M, O, U, L, D -> no S.\n\nWe need S.\n\nAnother word: ""FOCUS"" -> F, O, C, U, S -> C is forbidden.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> J, U, M, P, S -> no O.\n\nWe need O.\n\nWhat about ""MOPED""? M, O, P, E, D -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""LOVES"": L, O, V, E, S -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""DOGES"": D, O, G, E, S -> E forbidden.\n\n""POSH"": too short.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nWhat about ""SHOMA""? Not common.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M, O, S, S, Y. But we have two S\'s. And positions: if we guess ""MOSSY"":\n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at position 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position again? We already know that. So we want to avoid putting M at position 1.\n\nWe should try to put M in a new position, say position 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly for O and S.\n\nLet me try to list words with M, O, S and two other allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""MOULD"": but no S.\n- ""MOLDS"": M, O, L, D, S -> this has M, O, S and L, D. \n  - Check forbidden: M, O, S are allowed; L and D are allowed (not forbidden). \n  - Positions: \n    - M in position 1: but we know M cannot be in position 1. So if we guess ""MOLDS"", M is at position 1, which we know is incorrect. So we would get M marked as wrong position again? We don\'t gain new information about M\'s position.\n\nWe want to test M in a new position. So we should avoid position 1 for M.\n\nSimilarly, O should not be in position 2, and S not in position 4.\n\nSo for ""MOLDS"": M at 1 (bad), O at 2 (also bad because O cannot be at position 2).\n\nWe need a word where:\n- M is not at position 1\n- O is not at position 2\n- S is not at position 4\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWhat about ""DOLLY""? D, O, L, L, Y -> no M or S.\n\nWe need M and S.\n\nAnother word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n\n""SHOMA"": not common.\n\n""KIOSK"": K, I, O, S, K -> I is forbidden and K repeated? Also, no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nWhat about ""MOULD"" without the S? Not.\n\nPerhaps ""SMOKE"": S, M, O, K, E -> E is forbidden. No.\n\n""LOVES"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""DOGES"" -> E forbidden.\n\nThis is difficult. Let me think of words ending with S.\n\nWords with M, O, S and ending with them? \n\nAnother word: ""MOSIN"" -> not a word? \n\n""SOLEM"" -> not common.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? As I thought earlier. But let\'s see the positions in ""MOSSY"":\n- Position 1: M -> we know M is not at 1, so if we guess it, we expect M to be marked as wrong position (if we are lucky) and we learn nothing new about M\'s position? Actually, we would get M marked as present but wrong position (which we already know) and then we know the word has M, O, S, Y and maybe another letter.\n\nBut we don\'t know if Y is in the word. We are testing Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MOSPY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOPED"" -> forbidden letters.\n\nPerhaps ""BOMBS"": B, O, M, B, S -> has O, M, S and B. But B is allowed? \n- Positions: M is at position 3, O at 2, S at 5.\n  - O is at position 2: but we know O cannot be at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback: O was at position 2 and was wrong). So if we put O at position 2, we know it will be wrong again? So we should avoid that.\n\nWe should avoid putting O at position 2 and M at position 1 and S at position 4.\n\nIn ""BOMBS"":\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: O -> we know O cannot be at position 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t learn anything new about O\'s position.\n\nWe want to test O in a new position. So we should put O in a position that is allowed: 1,3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for M: positions 2,3,4,5 (since not 1).\n\nFor S: positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word with M, O, S in positions that are allowed.\n\nFor example:\n- Put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWe need to fill with O and S and two other letters.\n\nWhat about ""WHOMS""? W, H, O, M, S -> \n- Positions: \n  - Position 1: W\n  - Position 2: H\n  - Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (since not forbidden, only that it cannot be at 2)\n  - Position 4: M -> M can be at 4? (since not forbidden for M: M can be at 4? We only know M is not at 1. Position 4 is new.\n  - Position 5: S -> S can be at 5? (since not forbidden for S: S can be at 5? We only know S is not at 4.)\n\nSo ""WHOMS"" is a word? ""Whoms"" is not common. ""Whom"" is a word, but ""whoms"" might be plural? Actually, ""whom"" is the object form, but ""whoms"" is not standard. Let me check: in Wordle, ""whoms"" might not be accepted. We should use common words.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOMA"" -> not common.\n\nWhat about ""LOUSY"": but no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden letters.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word: ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n\n""BOYSY"": no M.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? M, O, S, S, Y -> \n- Position 1: M -> but we know M is not at 1, so we should avoid.\n- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so avoid.\n- Position 3: S -> okay, S can be at 3? \n- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4? We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at position 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information about S\'s position? And we use a forbidden position.\n\nWe should avoid that.\n\nSo we need to avoid positions 1 for M, 2 for O, and 4 for S.\n\nLet me try to put M at position 2? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWe need O and S.\n\nExample: ""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\n""AMUSE"" -> A and E forbidden.\n\n""EMBOS"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""GUIMP"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nAnother word: ""BOMBS"" -> as before, O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> so we know O will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t test a new position.\n\nWe need to test O in a new position. Let\'s try O at position 1.\n\nWord: O _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and S inside.\n\nFor example: ""OMBS"" -> too short.\n\n""OCCUR"" -> no S and C forbidden.\n\n""OMPHALOSKEPTIC"" -> too long.\n\nNot working.\n\nWhat about putting S at position 1? Then M and O elsewhere.\n\nWord: S _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and O.\n\nExample: ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.\n\n""SHOMA"" -> not common.\n\n""SKIMS"" -> no O.\n\nI think we need to consider that the word might have U or other vowels.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUSY"": M, O, U, S, Y -> \n- Position 1: M -> avoid (since M cannot be at 1)\n- Position 2: O -> avoid (O cannot be at 2)\n\nSo not.\n\nWhat about ""YOMIM"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word: ""LOUSY"" -> no M.\n\nWe need to include M.\n\nWhat about ""MOSPY""? Not a word.\n\n""PSYCH"" -> no M and C forbidden.\n\nI recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but let\'s try to find a better one.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY""? Not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nWe need S.\n\nWhat about ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\nPerhaps we should use a word that doesn\'t have M at 1, O at 2, and S at 4? But we can have M at 2,3,4,5; O at 1,3,4,5; S at 1,2,3,5.\n\nLet me try to find a word with M at position 2, for example.\n\nWord: ? M ? ? ?\n\nWith O and S.\n\nExample: ""UMBER"" -> U, M, B, E, R -> E and R forbidden.\n\n""UMBEL"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""AMBER"" -> A forbidden.\n\nNot working.\n\nWhat about M at position 3?\n\nWord: ? ? M ? ?\n\nWith O and S.\n\nExample: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2 (forbidden) and M at 3? \n- Position 1: B\n- Position 2: O (forbidden) -> same problem.\n\nWe need to avoid O at 2.\n\nSo let\'s try O at position 1.\n\nWord: O _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""OUMAS"" -> not common.\n\n""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OUPHE"" -> not common.\n\nNot working.\n\nPerhaps O at position 3.\n\nWord: _ _ O _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""BLOBS"" -> B, L, O, B, S -> has S, but no M? We need M.\n\nWe need M.\n\n""BLOOM"" -> B, L, O, O, M -> has O and M, but no S? We need S.\n\nWe need S.\n\n""BLOBS"" has S, but no M.\n\nWe need a word with M, O, S.\n\nLet me search for words that have M, O, S.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""MOSaic"" -> forbidden letters.\n- ""MOSHY"" -> not valid.\n- ""LOSING"" -> forbidden letters.\n- ""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.\n\nAnother common word: ""BOSOM"" -> B, O, S, O, M -> \n- Positions: \n  - Position 1: B\n  - Position 2: O -> forbidden for O? We know O cannot be at position 2. So if we guess O at 2, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.\n\nBut let\'s see: \n- Position 3: S -> S can be at 3? (allowed)\n- Position 4: O -> O can be at 4? (allowed, since O can be at 4? We only know O is not at 2)\n- Position 5: M -> M can be at 5? (allowed)\n\nSo ""BOSOM"" has:\n- Position 1: B (new)\n- Position 2: O -> we know O is not at 2, so it will be marked as wrong position again? We don\'t learn the position of O.\n\nWe want to test O in a new position, say position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S at position 3 is new.\n\nM at position 5 is new.\n\nSo ""BOSOM"" might be acceptable, but we are using O at 2 which we know is wrong.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nWhat about ""MOSSY""? \n- Position 1: M -> avoid (M not at 1)\n- Position 2: O -> avoid (O not at 2)\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has O and S in new positions and M in a new position.\n\nLet me try: \n- Put M at position 4? \n- Put O at position 1? \n- Put S at position 2? \n\nWord: O ? S ? M ? \n\nBut we need two more letters.\n\nExample: ""OASIS"" -> A and I forbidden.\n\n""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""OCEAN"" -> C, E, A forbidden.\n\nNot working.\n\nPut O at position 1 and M at position 3? \nWord: O ? M ? S\n\nExample: ""OAKUM"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OPALS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""ORCAS"" -> R and A forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\nPut O at position 3 and M at position 2? \nWord: ? M O ? ?\n\nWith S.\n\nExample: ""BMOLE"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""DMORE"" -> E forbidden.\n\n""GMOCH"" -> not a word.\n\nThis is hard.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have U.\n\nWord: ? ? M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5.\n\nBut O at 4 is allowed (since not 2), M at 3 is allowed (not 1), S at 5 is allowed (not 4).\n\nSo positions: \n- Position 1: ? (must be a letter not forbidden and not M,O,S)\n- Position 2: ? (same)\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: O\n- Position 5: S\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nWhat letters for positions 1 and 2?\n\nWe can use: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word of the form: _ _ M O S\n\nWhat words end with ""MOS""? Like ""BIOMOS"" -> not a word.\n\n""DEMO"" -> too short.\n\n""IOM"" -> too short.\n\n""KIOSK"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""LI MOS"" -> not a word.\n\n""PILOT"" -> I and T forbidden.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""VOMIT"" -> I and T forbidden.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother word: ""LOUMS"" -> not common.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might have U.\n\nWord: _ _ M O S\n\nWith U? \n\nExample: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\nI think we are missing a word.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUSY"" but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nAnother idea: ""MOSSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nWe need to give up and use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But we can\'t because the forbidden positions are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that we are unsure about, but we have to avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nFor example, we can try M at position 2, which is allowed (since not 1). O at position 4? O can be at 4? Yes, because O is not forbidden for position 4 (only not 2). S at position 5? S can be at 5? (not 4).\n\nSo positions: \n- Position 1: some letter (say B) \n- Position 2: M\n- Position 3: some letter (say P)\n- Position 4: O\n- Position 5: S\n\nSo the word: B M P O S\n\nIs that a word? ""BMPOS"" -> no.\n\n""BLUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""GLUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""GRUMS"" -> R forbidden.\n\n""KUMUS"" -> not common.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUSY"" -> M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nFor example:\n- M at position 2: allowed.\n- O at position 4: allowed.\n- S at position 5: allowed.\n\nBut what word? ""UMOS"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""MOUSY"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMS"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\nI recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes used, but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nWe are stuck with M at 1 or O at 2 or S at 4? But we cannot do that.\n\nWait, we can do M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""M O S U Y"" -> ""mosuy"" not a word.\n\n""MOUSY"" is M at 1, O at 2: no.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that the word might be ""MOSSY"", but let\'s accept it? Or better, find another.\n\nAnother word: ""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions are fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but we have to avoid the known wrong positions? But we cannot avoid them completely, but we can test new positions.\n\nBut we cannot put M at 1, O at 2, S at 4.\n\nSo for M, we can put it at 2,3,4,5.\nO at 1,3,4,5.\nS at 1,2,3,5.\n\nLet me try to find a word with M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word has that pattern?\n\nFor example: ""UM"" at the beginning? ""UM"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to accept that we cannot avoid the forbidden positions? But we must avoid them because we know they are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but in positions that are not forbidden? But the positions 1,2,4 are forbidden for M,O,S respectively? But we can put them elsewhere.\n\nFor example, put M at 3? Then O and S elsewhere.\n\nWord: ? ? M ? ?\n\nWith O and S.\n\nExample: ""BOMBS"" -> O at 2: forbidden.\n\n""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""DEMO"" -> too short.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\n""LOUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""POUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""YUMBS"" -> Y, U, M, B, S -> \n- Position 1: Y\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: M\n- Position 4: B\n- Position 5: S\n\nNow, check constraints:\n- M: position 3 -> allowed (since not 1)\n- O: not present? But we need O. We have O? ""YUMBS"" has no O.\n\nWe need O.\n\nAnother word: ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\n""DOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\n""FOCUS"" -> C forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has O and S but not M? But we need M.\n\nWe must have M.\n\nPerhaps ""MOUSY"" -> but M at 1 and O at 2: forbidden.\n\nWe are running out of options.\n\nAnother word: ""SOLID"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""MOULD"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""SLOOM"" -> not a word.\n\nI recall that ""MOSSY"" is sometimes accepted as a variant of ""mossy"", but it has O at 2? ""MOSSY"": M at 1, O at 2: both forbidden.\n\nLet\'s think differently. We know the secret word has M, O, S. And two other letters that are not in the forbidden set.\n\nForbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T.\n\nSo available: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe need to guess a word that has M, O, S and two from the above.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\n- ""MOUSY"": M at 1 (forbidden), O at 2 (forbidden). No.\n\n- ""MOSBY"": not a word.\n\n- ""MOXIE"": M at 1, O at 2, X, I, E -> I and E forbidden.\n\n- ""MOCHA"": C and A forbidden.\n\n- ""MODOS"" -> not common.\n\n- ""MOGUL"" -> no S.\n\n- ""MOIST"" we already tried.\n\nWe tried ""moist"".\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""BOUSY"" -> not a word.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put them in positions that are not forbidden? But we can\'t.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has M, O, S but with M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nFor example:\n- Put M at 3, O at 4, S at 5? Then we need positions 1 and 2.\n\nWord: [letter1] [letter2] M O S\n\nWhat words? ""DO M O S"" -> ""DO MOS"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""UM M O S"" -> not.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nPerhaps ""MUMUS"" -> M at 1: forbidden.\n\nI think we have to accept that we have to use a word that has M, O, S but we have to put M at 2, O at 4, S at 5? But what word? ""UMOS"" is not 5 letters.\n\n""UMPS"" -> U, M, P, S -> but no O? We need O.\n\nWe must have O.\n\nAnother word: ""BOOMS"" -> B, O, O, M, S -> \n- Positions: \n  - 1: B\n  - 2: O -> forbidden (O cannot be at 2)\n  - 3: O -> but we don\'t know if O is duplicated? But we have two O\'s? \n  - 4: M -> M can be at 4? (allowed)\n  - 5: S -> S can be at 5? (allowed)\n\nBut O at 2 and 3: we know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 might be correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we have two O\'s? The secret word might have two O\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""BOOMS"", we have O at 2 and 3. We know O at 2 is wrong, so that O will be marked as absent? Or if the secret word has O at 3, it might be correct.\n\nBut we are guessing to get information.\n\nBut we are forced to use a word that has O at 2? We cannot.\n\nWe need a word that does not put O at 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to put O at position 1.\n\nWord: O _ _ _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""OASIS"" -> A forbidden.\n\n""OPIUM"" -> I forbidden.\n\n""OUMAS"" -> not common.\n\n""OUMA"" -> too short.\n\n""OUMAS"" -> not common.\n\n""OUPHE"" -> not common.\n\n""OXBOW"" -> no S.\n\nNot.\n\nPut O at position 3.\n\nWord: _ _ O _ _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""BLOBS"" -> no M.\n\n""COMBS"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""DEMO"" -> too short.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> no O.\n\n""POUMS"" -> not common.\n\n""YUMBS"" -> no O.\n\nNot.\n\nPut O at position 4.\n\nWord: _ _ _ O _\n\nWith M and S.\n\nExample: ""BO O S"" -> not 5 letters.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> E and N forbidden.\n\n""FOYER"" -> E and R forbidden.\n\n""LOXES"" -> E and X?

We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""SPOOL"", we have O at 3 and 4. We know O at 2 is wrong, but O at 3 and 4 are new.\n\nBut we also have S at 1, which is allowed.\n\nAnd M is missing? We need M.\n\nSo ""SPOOL"" has no M.\n\nWe need M.\n\nAnother word: ""SLOSH"" -> S, L, O, S, H -> \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed)\n- Position 4: S -> but S cannot be at position 4! We know S is not at position 4. So if we put S at 4, we know it will be wrong. So we get no new information.\n\nWe should avoid putting S at 4.\n\nIn ""SLOSH"", S is at 1 and 4. We know S at 4 is wrong, so we avoid that.\n\nBut we have to include M.\n\nAnother word: ""SOLAR"" -> forbidden.\n\nI think we have to use a word that has M, O, S.\n\nLet me think of ""M"" at position 2, ""O"" at position 3, ""S"" at position 1? \n\nWord: S M O ? ?\n\nWith two letters.\n\nExample: ""S M O W Y"" -> ""SMOWY"" not a word.\n\n"" S M O G Y"" -> ""SMOGY"" -> S, M, O, G, Y -> \n- Position 1: S -> allowed\n- Position 2: M -> M can be at 2? (allowed, since M not forbidden at 2)\n- Position 3: O -> O can be at 3? (allowed, since O not forbidden at 3)\n- Position 4: G\n- Position 5: Y\n\nThis seems promising: ""SMOGY"" is a word.\n\nAnd it has S at 1, M at 2, O at 3, and then G and Y.\n\nCheck forbidden letters: S, M, O, G, Y. \n- S: allowed\n- M: allowed\n- O: allowed\n- G: allowed\n- Y: allowed\n\nAnd forbidden: C,R,A,N,E,I,T are not in it.\n\nSo ""SMOGY"" is a valid guess.\n\nAlso, positions:\n- M is at position 2: which is new (previously M was at 1, now at 2)\n- O is at position 3: previously O was at 2, now at 3 (so we test a new position)\n- S is at position 1: previously S was at 4, now at 1 (so new position)\n\nAnd we test G and Y.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""M O S U P"" -> not a word.\n\n""MOGUL"" -> no S.\n\n""SMOGY"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n- Position 1: S -> we know S is in the word but not at position 4. We don\'t know about position 1. So we can test it.\n- Position 2: M -> we know M is not at position 1, but position 2 is new.\n- Position 3: O -> we know O is not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n- Position 4: G -> new letter.\n- Position 5: Y -> new letter.\n\nThis will give us information about the positions of M, O, S and also test G and Y.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If S at 1 is correct, we get a check.\n- If M at 2 is correct, we get a check.\n- If O at 3 is correct, we get a check.\n\nAnd we learn about G and Y.\n\nSo I think ""SMOGY"" is a good guess.\n\nAnother word: ""DOUMA"" -> no S.\n\nOr ""BOUMS"" -> not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SMOGY"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with U.\n\nWord: _ _ M O S -> but we need two letters. ""UM M O S"" -> not.\n\n""UMIAC"" -> no S.\n\nI think ""SMOGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo my guess is ""SMOGY"".\n\nBut note: in ""SMOGY"", we have O at position 3. We know O is in the word but not at position 2, but position 3 is new.\n\nSimilarly, S at 1, M at 2.\n\nWe also test G and Y.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect, so the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n- ""moist"" had M, O, and S present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent.\n\nThe secret word must contain M, O, and S, but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively. It cannot contain C, R, A, N, E, I, or T. \n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""smog"" as the word because:\n- It includes the known letters M, O, S (M at position 2, O at position 3, S at position 1).\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, I, T).\n- It tests new positions for M, O, S (S at position 1, M at position 2, O at position 3) and introduces two new letters (G and Y) to gather more information.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of M, O, S and check for G and Y.\n\n<guess>smog</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(-) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: smog -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""smog"": \n  Model answer is not five letters.\n\nThis indicates that ""smog"" is not a valid 5-letter word. Therefore, the previous guess ""moist"" was valid but the secret word is not ""moist"". We must choose a new guess that is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nRecall the feedback from previous guesses:\n- Guess 1: ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E not in the word).\n- Guess 2: ""moist"" had M, O, S present but in wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T absent.\n- Guess 3: ""smog"" was invalid (not five letters).\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains M, O, S (from guess 2).\n- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T (from all guesses).\n- M is not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word.\n- Includes M, O, S (since they are in the word, and we need to find their correct positions).\n- Avoids the forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T.\n- Puts M, O, S in positions that are allowed: M not at 1, O not at 2, S not at 4.\n\nWe also need to include two new letters to test.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and M, O, S are already included).\n\nWe have to form a word with M, O, S and two from the above.\n\nPossible words? Let\'s think.\n\nWe know the word has M, O, S. We need to test new positions for them.\n\nPossible positions:\n- M: can be at 2,3,4,5 (not 1)\n- O: can be at 1,3,4,5 (not 2)\n- S: can be at 1,2,3,5 (not 4)\n\nWe also need two more letters.\n\nLet me try to find words that fit.\n\nWord: _ _ M O S -> but then M at 3, O at 4, S at 5. \nWe need to fill the first two positions.\n\nWhat words start with two letters and then ""MOS""? \n- ""UM M O S"" -> not, because ""UMOS"" is not a word.\n- ""BO M O S"" -> ""BOMOS"" not a word.\n\nWord: _ _ _ O M -> but then O at 4, M at 5? But S needs to be placed? \nWe have to include S.\n\nWord: _ _ S O M -> "" S O M"" at the end?

We have feedback from Guess 4: ""smoky"" -> S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) K(x) Y(x)

This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- M is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K is not in the word (x).
- Y is not in the word (x).

So the secret word starts with ""S M O"", so the first three letters are ""S M O"".

The word is ""S M O _ _"".

We also know from previous feedback:
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y (from all guesses: K and Y are now added to the forbidden list).
- Additionally, from Guess 2, we know that the word has M, O, S, but now we have their positions: S at 1, M at 2, O at 3.

So the secret word is ""S M O"" followed by two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SMO"" and the last two letters are from the available set.

Common words that start with ""SMO"":
- ""SMOKE"" -> but K is forbidden and E is forbidden.
- ""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.
- ""SMOOT"" -> O repeated? And T forbidden.
- ""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.
- ""SMOOS"" -> duplicate O? And S is already at the start, but the word has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in this case, the last two letters are O and S? ""SMOOS"" is not a word.

We need to consider other possibilities.

Possible words:
- ""SMOUL"" -> not a word.
- ""SMOOF"" -> not a word.
- ""SMOGY"" -> we tried, but K and Y are forbidden now.
- ""SMOKY"" -> K and Y are forbidden.

What about ""SMOBB""? Not a word.

""SMODD""? Not a word.

""SMOEG""? Not a word.

""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.

""SMOOS"" -> not a word.

""SMOUL"" -> not standard.

Perhaps ""SMOUP"" -> not a word.

I think we have to consider less common words.

Another word: ""SMOFT"" -> T forbidden.

""SMOGH"" -> not a word.

""SMOGH"" -> not common.

""SMOIN"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOIR"" -> I and R forbidden.

Not.

""SMOKE"" is the most common, but K and E are forbidden.

What about ""SMOBY""? Not a word.

""SMOCH"" -> C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" -> C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" is not a word.

""SMODE"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOED"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" -> F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" -> G is allowed, but ""SMOGS"" is a word? ""Smogs"" is the plural of smog, but it's 5 letters? ""Smogs"" is 5 letters: S, M, O, G, S -> but duplicate S? And we have S at the end.

But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in ""smoky"" we had S at position 1 and it was correct, and then in ""smog"" we had S at position 4 which was wrong, but now we have S at position 1 correct. So if the word has two S's, then we might have S at other positions? But we don't have evidence.

But in ""smogs"", we have S at 1 and 5. We know S is not at position 4 (from ""moist"" feedback), but position 5 is new.

Also, G is at position 4.

So ""smogs"" is a candidate: S, M, O, G, S.

But we have two S's. Is that allowed? The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicate letters.

But we have to check the forbidden letters: ""smogs"" has S, M, O, G, S. 
- S: allowed (we know S is in the word)
- M: allowed (correct position)
- O: allowed (correct position)
- G: allowed (not forbidden)
- S: allowed (duplicate, but we know S is in the word)

Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,T,K,Y are not in ""smogs"".

So it is a candidate.

But we have two S's. Is that possible? The feedback from ""moist"" had S marked as present but wrong position (at position 4), and in ""smoky"" we have S at position 1 correct. So if the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" was not correct, but it could be that the word has S at position 1 and another S at position 5? Then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be absent? But ""moist"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it could be that the S is at position 1 or 5, so position 4 is wrong.

In ""smogs"", we have S at 1 and 5. The S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be absent? But we know from ""moist"" that S is in the word, so if the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be marked as present but wrong position? But in ""moist"", position 4 was S, and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is an S in the word but not at position 4. That is consistent with ""smogs"" having S at 1 and 5, so one S at position 1 (which is correct) and another S at position 5 (which is not at position 4, so it could be position 5).

But in ""smogs"", the last letter is S, so position 5 is S.

And position 4 is G.

So ""smogs"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it is a valid word. ""Smogs"" is the plural of ""smog"", which is a valid word. So ""smogs"" is valid.

Another candidate: ""SMOKE"" is invalid because of K and E.

""SMOIL"" has I.

""SMOOT"" has T.

""SMOOR"" has R.

""SMOGS"" -> ""smogs"" is the plural, so yes.

But we have two S's? ""smogs"" has two S's? Let's write: S-M-O-G-S. So positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:O, 4:G, 5:S.

So it has two S's.

But is that allowed? The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicates.

We also have ""SMOBY"" not a word.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" is not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the plural of ""smog"", and it is a valid word.

Another word: ""SMULS"" -> ""smuls"" not a word.

""SMOUL"" not standard.

""SMOUP"" not.

Perhaps ""SMOFT"" T forbidden.

I think ""smogs"" is a valid candidate.

But we have to consider if there are words without duplicate S.

For example, ""SMOHA"" -> not a word.

""SMOHY"" -> not.

""SMOJY"" -> not.

""SMOLY"" -> not.

""SMOPY"" -> not.

""SMOSY"" -> not.

""SMOZY"" -> not.

""SMOBB"" -> not.

""SMOCH"" -> C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" -> C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMOED"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOKE"" -> K and E forbidden.

So the only common word I can think of is ""smogs"".

But let's confirm the forbidden letters: 
- S: not forbidden, but we have two S's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates.
- M: correct at position 2.
- O: correct at position 3.
- G: not forbidden.
- S: not forbidden.

But we have to check if G is allowed. Yes, G is not in the forbidden list.

Also, the word ""smogs"" is plural of ""smog"", which is valid.

Another possibility: ""SMOKE"" is invalid.

What about ""SMITH""? But I is forbidden and H is allowed, but I is forbidden.

""SMOKE"" is out.

Perhaps ""SMOOR"" is out.

I think ""smogs"" is the only common word that fits.

But we have to make a guess. Since we have three letters fixed, we can guess ""smogs"".

But note: we have two S's. If the secret word is ""smogs"", then the last letter is S, so position 5 is S.

In ""moist"", we had S at position 4, which was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word is ""smogs"", then there is an S at position 1 and 5. So when we guessed ""moist"" with S at position 4, it was not correct, but there is an S in the word (at position 1 and 5), so the S at position 4 in ""moist"" is not matching, so it was marked as wrong position, which is consistent.

Similarly, in ""smoky"", we have S at position 1 correct, M at 2 correct, O at 3 correct, K and Y absent, which is consistent with ""smogs"" having no K or Y.

So ""smogs"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure that the last two letters are not forbidden. In ""smogs"", the last two are G and S.

G is not forbidden, S is already in the word, so having another S is allowed.

We can also consider ""SMOKE"" but it's invalid.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not a word.

""SMOJA"" -> J, but ""smoja"" not.

""SMOKY"" -> K and Y forbidden.

""SMOON"" -> O duplicate? ""SMOON"" has two O's, but ""smoon"" is a word? ""Moon"" is a word, but ""smoon"" is 5 letters? S, M, O, O, N -> but N is forbidden. ""Smoon"" has N? S-M-O-O-N, so the last letter is N, which is forbidden.

""SMOON"" is not allowed.

""SMOOR"" R forbidden.

So I think ""smogs"" is the best bet.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate S.

For example, ""SMOBY"" not a word.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the plural, so I think it's the only common word.

Perhaps ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is a word? ""Smug"" is adjective, but ""smugs"" is the plural? ""Smugs"" is not common. ""Smug"" is 5 letters: S-M-U-G, but that's 4 letters? S, M, U, G. That's 4. ""Smug"" is 4 letters. ""Smugs"" would be 5? S-M-U-G-S, that's 5: positions 1:S, 2:M, 3:U, 4:G, 5:S. But ""smugs"" is not a standard word. I think ""smugs"" might be accepted? But ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so ""smogs"" is 5.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not.

""SMOHY"" not.

""SMOJY"" not.

""SMOLY"" not.

""SMOPY"" not.

""SMOSY"" not.

""SMOZY"" not.

""SMOBB"" not.

I think we have to go with ""smogs"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know the secret word starts with ""SMO"".

The last two letters must be from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But K is forbidden now (from ""smoky"" feedback: K(x)), and Y is forbidden.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Now, words starting with ""SMO"" and ending with two letters from this set.

Possible endings:
- With G: ""SMOG"" is 4 letters, so not.
- With H: ""SMOHH"" not a word.
- With J: ""SMOJJ"" not.
- With L: ""SMOL"" not 5 letters.
- With P: ""SMOP"" not 5 letters.
- With Q: ""SMOQ"" not.
- With U: ""SMOU"" not 5 letters? ""Smou"" is not, but ""smou"" is not standard. ""Smog"" is 4.
- With V: ""SMOV"" not.
- With W: ""SMO W"" not.
- With X: ""SMOX"" not.
- With Z: ""SMOZ"" not.

Only ""SMOGS"" is plausible.

Perhaps ""SMOFS"" is not a word, but ""SMF"" not.

Another word: ""SMOUL"" not standard.

I think ""smogs"" is the only common word that fits.

So I'll guess ""smogs"".

But let's confirm the spelling. ""Smogs"" is the plural of ""smog"", which is acceptable.

In the feedback, we have to be cautious.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"" is invalid, but ""smoky"" we tried and K and Y are out.

So ""smogs"" is the next best.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not a word.

""SMOBI"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the only common word.

Perhaps ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is not standard. ""Smug"" is 4 letters, and ""smugs"" might be accepted? But ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so 5-letter word: ""smogs"".

I think we should guess ""smogs"".

But note: in ""smogs"", the last letter is S. We know from ""moist"" that S is not at position 4, but position 5 is new. And we have G at position 4.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but in this case, we are putting S at position 5, which is a new position.

So I'll go with ""smogs"".

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate S.

Perhaps ""SMOUL"" is not standard.

""SMOUP"" not.

I think not.

Another word: ""SMOFT"" T forbidden.

So I think ""smogs"" is the best guess.

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""SMOHA"" is not English.

I think we have to use ""smogs"".

So the guess is ""smogs"".

But let's write it.

<guess>smogs</guess>

But we have to be careful. The feedback might confirm.

If the secret word is ""smogs"", then:
- Position 1: S correct.
- Position 2: M correct.
- Position 3: O correct.
- Position 4: G? We are guessing S, but if the word is ""smogs"", then position 4 is G, so if we guess ""smogs"", position 4 is G, which should be correct? But we are guessing S at position 5.

The word ""smogs"" has positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:O, 4:G, 5:S.

So if we guess ""smogs"", the feedback should be:
- S at 1: correct (✓)
- M at 2: correct (✓)
- O at 3: correct (✓)
- G at 4: ? We don't know.
- S at 5: ? 

But we know the secret word has S at position 5? We don't know for sure, but if it is ""smogs"", then yes.

But we are guessing to find out.

Perhaps there is another word.

What about ""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.

No.

""SMOKE"" -> K and E forbidden.

No.

""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.

No.

""SMOOT"" -> T forbidden.

No.

""SMOUL"" -> not standard.

I think ""smogs"" is the only possibility.

Another word: ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is not a standard word. ""Smug"" is 4 letters, and ""smugs"" might be accepted, but ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so 5-letter word: ""smogs"".

Perhaps ""SMOBY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""smogs"".

But let's see the feedback from ""smoky"": K and Y are absent, so ""smogs"" has no K or Y, so it's fine.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, and S are present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3: smog** → Invalid (not five letters).
- **Guess 4: smoky** → S(✓) at position 1, M(✓) at position 2, O(✓) at position 3, K(x), Y(x).

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""S M O"" (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed: S, M, O).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y (from all feedback).
- Positions 4 and 5 are unknown but must be filled with letters not in the forbidden set.
- The only common English word fitting ""S M O _ _"" is **""smogs""** (plural of ""smog""), as other options are invalid (e.g., ""smoke"" contains K and E, ""smoil"" has I, ""smoot"" has T).

Given the constraints, ""smogs"" is the most likely candidate:
- Positions 4 and 5: G and S (duplicate S is allowed, as we don't have evidence against duplicates).
- Forbidden letters are not in ""smogs"" (G and S are allowed, though S is already confirmed).

This guess will either be fully correct or reveal the missing letters.

<guess>smogs</guess>",smogs,"We have feedback from Guess 4: ""smoky"" -> S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) K(x) Y(x)

This means:
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- M is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- K is not in the word (x).
- Y is not in the word (x).

So the secret word starts with ""S M O"", so the first three letters are ""S M O"".

The word is ""S M O _ _"".

We also know from previous feedback:
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y (from all guesses: K and Y are now added to the forbidden list).
- Additionally, from Guess 2, we know that the word has M, O, S, but now we have their positions: S at 1, M at 2, O at 3.

So the secret word is ""S M O"" followed by two more letters that are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SMO"" and the last two letters are from the available set.

Common words that start with ""SMO"":
- ""SMOKE"" -> but K is forbidden and E is forbidden.
- ""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.
- ""SMOOT"" -> O repeated? And T forbidden.
- ""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.
- ""SMOOS"" -> duplicate O? And S is already at the start, but the word has two S's? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But in this case, the last two letters are O and S? ""SMOOS"" is not a word.

We need to consider other possibilities.

Possible words:
- ""SMOUL"" -> not a word.
- ""SMOOF"" -> not a word.
- ""SMOGY"" -> we tried, but K and Y are forbidden now.
- ""SMOKY"" -> K and Y are forbidden.

What about ""SMOBB""? Not a word.

""SMODD""? Not a word.

""SMOEG""? Not a word.

""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.

""SMOOS"" -> not a word.

""SMOUL"" -> not standard.

Perhaps ""SMOUP"" -> not a word.

I think we have to consider less common words.

Another word: ""SMOFT"" -> T forbidden.

""SMOGH"" -> not a word.

""SMOGH"" -> not common.

""SMOIN"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOIR"" -> I and R forbidden.

Not.

""SMOKE"" is the most common, but K and E are forbidden.

What about ""SMOBY""? Not a word.

""SMOCH"" -> C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" -> C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" is not a word.

""SMODE"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOED"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" -> F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" -> G is allowed, but ""SMOGS"" is a word? ""Smogs"" is the plural of smog, but it's 5 letters? ""Smogs"" is 5 letters: S, M, O, G, S -> but duplicate S? And we have S at the end.

But we know S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. However, in ""smoky"" we had S at position 1 and it was correct, and then in ""smog"" we had S at position 4 which was wrong, but now we have S at position 1 correct. So if the word has two S's, then we might have S at other positions? But we don't have evidence.

But in ""smogs"", we have S at 1 and 5. We know S is not at position 4 (from ""moist"" feedback), but position 5 is new.

Also, G is at position 4.

So ""smogs"" is a candidate: S, M, O, G, S.

But we have two S's. Is that allowed? The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicate letters.

But we have to check the forbidden letters: ""smogs"" has S, M, O, G, S. 
- S: allowed (we know S is in the word)
- M: allowed (correct position)
- O: allowed (correct position)
- G: allowed (not forbidden)
- S: allowed (duplicate, but we know S is in the word)

Forbidden letters: C,R,A,N,E,I,T,K,Y are not in ""smogs"".

So it is a candidate.

But we have two S's. Is that possible? The feedback from ""moist"" had S marked as present but wrong position (at position 4), and in ""smoky"" we have S at position 1 correct. So if the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" was not correct, but it could be that the word has S at position 1 and another S at position 5? Then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be absent? But ""moist"" had S at position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one S in the word, but it could be that the S is at position 1 or 5, so position 4 is wrong.

In ""smogs"", we have S at 1 and 5. The S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be absent? But we know from ""moist"" that S is in the word, so if the word has two S's, then the S at position 4 in ""moist"" would be marked as present but wrong position? But in ""moist"", position 4 was S, and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that there is an S in the word but not at position 4. That is consistent with ""smogs"" having S at 1 and 5, so one S at position 1 (which is correct) and another S at position 5 (which is not at position 4, so it could be position 5).

But in ""smogs"", the last letter is S, so position 5 is S.

And position 4 is G.

So ""smogs"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it is a valid word. ""Smogs"" is the plural of ""smog"", which is a valid word. So ""smogs"" is valid.

Another candidate: ""SMOKE"" is invalid because of K and E.

""SMOIL"" has I.

""SMOOT"" has T.

""SMOOR"" has R.

""SMOGS"" -> ""smogs"" is the plural, so yes.

But we have two S's? ""smogs"" has two S's? Let's write: S-M-O-G-S. So positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:O, 4:G, 5:S.

So it has two S's.

But is that allowed? The feedback doesn't prohibit duplicates.

We also have ""SMOBY"" not a word.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" is not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the plural of ""smog"", and it is a valid word.

Another word: ""SMULS"" -> ""smuls"" not a word.

""SMOUL"" not standard.

""SMOUP"" not.

Perhaps ""SMOFT"" T forbidden.

I think ""smogs"" is a valid candidate.

But we have to consider if there are words without duplicate S.

For example, ""SMOHA"" -> not a word.

""SMOHY"" -> not.

""SMOJY"" -> not.

""SMOLY"" -> not.

""SMOPY"" -> not.

""SMOSY"" -> not.

""SMOZY"" -> not.

""SMOBB"" -> not.

""SMOCH"" -> C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" -> C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMOED"" -> E forbidden.

""SMOKE"" -> K and E forbidden.

So the only common word I can think of is ""smogs"".

But let's confirm the forbidden letters: 
- S: not forbidden, but we have two S's? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates.
- M: correct at position 2.
- O: correct at position 3.
- G: not forbidden.
- S: not forbidden.

But we have to check if G is allowed. Yes, G is not in the forbidden list.

Also, the word ""smogs"" is plural of ""smog"", which is valid.

Another possibility: ""SMOKE"" is invalid.

What about ""SMITH""? But I is forbidden and H is allowed, but I is forbidden.

""SMOKE"" is out.

Perhaps ""SMOOR"" is out.

I think ""smogs"" is the only common word that fits.

But we have to make a guess. Since we have three letters fixed, we can guess ""smogs"".

But note: we have two S's. If the secret word is ""smogs"", then the last letter is S, so position 5 is S.

In ""moist"", we had S at position 4, which was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word is ""smogs"", then there is an S at position 1 and 5. So when we guessed ""moist"" with S at position 4, it was not correct, but there is an S in the word (at position 1 and 5), so the S at position 4 in ""moist"" is not matching, so it was marked as wrong position, which is consistent.

Similarly, in ""smoky"", we have S at position 1 correct, M at 2 correct, O at 3 correct, K and Y absent, which is consistent with ""smogs"" having no K or Y.

So ""smogs"" is a strong candidate.

But we have to make sure that the last two letters are not forbidden. In ""smogs"", the last two are G and S.

G is not forbidden, S is already in the word, so having another S is allowed.

We can also consider ""SMOKE"" but it's invalid.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not a word.

""SMOJA"" -> J, but ""smoja"" not.

""SMOKY"" -> K and Y forbidden.

""SMOON"" -> O duplicate? ""SMOON"" has two O's, but ""smoon"" is a word? ""Moon"" is a word, but ""smoon"" is 5 letters? S, M, O, O, N -> but N is forbidden. ""Smoon"" has N? S-M-O-O-N, so the last letter is N, which is forbidden.

""SMOON"" is not allowed.

""SMOOR"" R forbidden.

So I think ""smogs"" is the best bet.

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate S.

For example, ""SMOBY"" not a word.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the plural, so I think it's the only common word.

Perhaps ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is a word? ""Smug"" is adjective, but ""smugs"" is the plural? ""Smugs"" is not common. ""Smug"" is 5 letters: S-M-U-G, but that's 4 letters? S, M, U, G. That's 4. ""Smug"" is 4 letters. ""Smugs"" would be 5? S-M-U-G-S, that's 5: positions 1:S, 2:M, 3:U, 4:G, 5:S. But ""smugs"" is not a standard word. I think ""smugs"" might be accepted? But ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so ""smogs"" is 5.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not.

""SMOHY"" not.

""SMOJY"" not.

""SMOLY"" not.

""SMOPY"" not.

""SMOSY"" not.

""SMOZY"" not.

""SMOBB"" not.

I think we have to go with ""smogs"".

But let's double-check the feedback.

We know the secret word starts with ""SMO"".

The last two letters must be from the available set: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z. But K is forbidden now (from ""smoky"" feedback: K(x)), and Y is forbidden.

So available: B,D,F,G,H,J,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z.

Now, words starting with ""SMO"" and ending with two letters from this set.

Possible endings:
- With G: ""SMOG"" is 4 letters, so not.
- With H: ""SMOHH"" not a word.
- With J: ""SMOJJ"" not.
- With L: ""SMOL"" not 5 letters.
- With P: ""SMOP"" not 5 letters.
- With Q: ""SMOQ"" not.
- With U: ""SMOU"" not 5 letters? ""Smou"" is not, but ""smou"" is not standard. ""Smog"" is 4.
- With V: ""SMOV"" not.
- With W: ""SMO W"" not.
- With X: ""SMOX"" not.
- With Z: ""SMOZ"" not.

Only ""SMOGS"" is plausible.

Perhaps ""SMOFS"" is not a word, but ""SMF"" not.

Another word: ""SMOUL"" not standard.

I think ""smogs"" is the only common word that fits.

So I'll guess ""smogs"".

But let's confirm the spelling. ""Smogs"" is the plural of ""smog"", which is acceptable.

In the feedback, we have to be cautious.

Perhaps ""SMOKE"" is invalid, but ""smoky"" we tried and K and Y are out.

So ""smogs"" is the next best.

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""SMOHA"" not a word.

""SMOBI"" -> I forbidden.

""SMOCH"" C forbidden.

""SMOCS"" C and S duplicate? ""SMOCS"" not a word.

""SMODE"" E forbidden.

""SMOED"" E forbidden.

""SMOFS"" F is allowed, but ""SMOFS"" is not a word.

""SMOGS"" is the only common word.

Perhaps ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is not standard. ""Smug"" is 4 letters, and ""smugs"" might be accepted? But ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so 5-letter word: ""smogs"".

I think we should guess ""smogs"".

But note: in ""smogs"", the last letter is S. We know from ""moist"" that S is not at position 4, but position 5 is new. And we have G at position 4.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but in this case, we are putting S at position 5, which is a new position.

So I'll go with ""smogs"".

But let's see if there is a word without duplicate S.

Perhaps ""SMOUL"" is not standard.

""SMOUP"" not.

I think not.

Another word: ""SMOFT"" T forbidden.

So I think ""smogs"" is the best guess.

But we have to make a guess.

Perhaps ""SMOHA"" is not English.

I think we have to use ""smogs"".

So the guess is ""smogs"".

But let's write it.

<guess>smogs</guess>

But we have to be careful. The feedback might confirm.

If the secret word is ""smogs"", then:
- Position 1: S correct.
- Position 2: M correct.
- Position 3: O correct.
- Position 4: G? We are guessing S, but if the word is ""smogs"", then position 4 is G, so if we guess ""smogs"", position 4 is G, which should be correct? But we are guessing S at position 5.

The word ""smogs"" has positions: 1:S, 2:M, 3:O, 4:G, 5:S.

So if we guess ""smogs"", the feedback should be:
- S at 1: correct (✓)
- M at 2: correct (✓)
- O at 3: correct (✓)
- G at 4: ? We don't know.
- S at 5: ? 

But we know the secret word has S at position 5? We don't know for sure, but if it is ""smogs"", then yes.

But we are guessing to find out.

Perhaps there is another word.

What about ""SMOOR"" -> R forbidden.

No.

""SMOKE"" -> K and E forbidden.

No.

""SMOIL"" -> I forbidden.

No.

""SMOOT"" -> T forbidden.

No.

""SMOUL"" -> not standard.

I think ""smogs"" is the only possibility.

Another word: ""SMUGS"" -> ""smugs"" is not a standard word. ""Smug"" is 4 letters, and ""smugs"" might be accepted, but ""smogs"" is more common.

""Smog"" is 4 letters, so 5-letter word: ""smogs"".

Perhaps ""SMOBY"" not a word.

I think we have to guess ""smogs"".

But let's see the feedback from ""smoky"": K and Y are absent, so ""smogs"" has no K or Y, so it's fine.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so the secret word contains none of these letters.
- **Guess 2: moist** → M, O, and S are present but in the wrong positions (M not at position 1, O not at position 2, S not at position 4), and I and T are absent (x).
- **Guess 3: smog** → Invalid (not five letters).
- **Guess 4: smoky** → S(✓) at position 1, M(✓) at position 2, O(✓) at position 3, K(x), Y(x).

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""S M O"" (positions 1, 2, and 3 are confirmed: S, M, O).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, I, T, K, Y (from all feedback).
- Positions 4 and 5 are unknown but must be filled with letters not in the forbidden set.
- The only common English word fitting ""S M O _ _"" is **""smogs""** (plural of ""smog""), as other options are invalid (e.g., ""smoke"" contains K and E, ""smoil"" has I, ""smoot"" has T).

Given the constraints, ""smogs"" is the most likely candidate:
- Positions 4 and 5: G and S (duplicate S is allowed, as we don't have evidence against duplicates).
- Forbidden letters are not in ""smogs"" (G and S are allowed, though S is already confirmed).

This guess will either be fully correct or reveal the missing letters.",Guess 5: smogs -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) O(✓) G(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
