We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters N and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, N was in the 4th position and E in the 5th position of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     N is not at position 4.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 Since N and E are present, we should try to use a word that includes N and E, but in different positions.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - Contains N and E (but not at position 4 for N and not at position 5 for E).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's try to put N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5 respectively.

 Possibilities for N: it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note: we don't know the exact positions, but we know it's not at 4.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That's position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 But in ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D.
   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).

 However, we don't know if the word has L, I, D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that's not a common word? And it has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Let's think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""STONE"" -> 
   S, T, O, N, E.
   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.

 In ""STONE"":
   N is at position 4 -> we know that's not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.

 How about ""STEIN"":
   S, T, E, I, N.
   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": 
   I, N, L, E, T.
   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). 

 This seems good.

 But let's check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> 
   S, P, I, N, E.
   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.

 How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""UNITE"" -> 
   U, N, I, T, E.
   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.",Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters N and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, N was in the 4th position and E in the 5th position of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     N is not at position 4.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 Since N and E are present, we should try to use a word that includes N and E, but in different positions.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - Contains N and E (but not at position 4 for N and not at position 5 for E).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's try to put N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5 respectively.

 Possibilities for N: it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note: we don't know the exact positions, but we know it's not at 4.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That's position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 But in ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D.
   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).

 However, we don't know if the word has L, I, D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that's not a common word? And it has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Let's think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""STONE"" -> 
   S, T, O, N, E.
   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.

 In ""STONE"":
   N is at position 4 -> we know that's not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.

 How about ""STEIN"":
   S, T, E, I, N.
   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": 
   I, N, L, E, T.
   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). 

 This seems good.

 But let's check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> 
   S, P, I, N, E.
   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.

 How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""UNITE"" -> 
   U, N, I, T, E.
   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.

But note: we don\'t know the exact positions, but we know it\'s not at 4.\n\n Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That\'s position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.\n\n But in ""LINED"": \n   L, I, N, E, D.\n   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has L, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that\'s not a common word? And it has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Another idea: ""STONE"" -> \n   S, T, O, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.\n\n In ""STONE"":\n   N is at position 4 -> we know that\'s not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""STEIN"":\n   S, T, E, I, N.\n   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": \n   I, N, L, E, T.\n   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). \n\n This seems good.\n\n But let\'s check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> \n   S, P, I, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""NEEDS"": \n   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""UNITE"" -> \n   U, N, I, T, E.\n   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""UNTIE"": \n   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""INTEG""? But that\'s not a common word.\n\n Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> \n   S, I, N, E, W.\n   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But we have W, which is less common.\n\n How about ""MINES"": \n   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That\'s allowed. But note: we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don\'t know.\n\n To avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5\n   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n We can try:\n   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. \n   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). \n   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don\'t know about them.\n\n How about ""NOISE"": \n   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.\n\n How about ""NOBLE"": \n   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.\n\n How about ""NEXUS"": \n   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.\n\n But we don\'t know about X and U.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": \n   L, I, N, E, S -> \n      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: \n   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).\n\n So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). \n\n Also, we avoid C, R, A.\n\n So ""LINES"" is a candidate.\n\n But wait: we have S at the end. We don\'t know about S.\n\n Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> \n   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.\n\n However, ""MINES"" has two E\'s? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". \n\n We can also consider ""DINER"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\n How about ""DINES"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.\n\n But we don\'t know about D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.\n\n We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let\'s choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". \n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don\'t know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> \n   S, L, E, P, T.\n   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don\'t have to, but if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get information about N\'s position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.\n\n Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: we have to make sure we don\'t put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":\n   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). \n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can\'t because E is at 5. \n\n Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""BONES"": \n   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n But we don\'t know about B, O, S.\n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter S? We don\'t know about S. We can try it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that\'s not a word. \n\n Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. \n\n How about ""INLET"": \n   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). \n   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". \n\n We can choose either. Let\'s pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.\n\n I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""INLET"": \n      Position 1: I -> we don\'t know.\n      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s at 2.\n      Position 3: L -> unknown.\n      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.\n      Position 5: T -> unknown.\n\n This will help us:\n\n   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it\'s present but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   Similarly for E at 4.\n\n Also, we get information about I, L, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let\'s choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""INLET"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.\n\n Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it\'s not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).\n\n So let\'s choose ""INLET"".\n\n However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""INLET"": \n   N is at position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E).\n\n So that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".\n\n But let me double-check: \n   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\n   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\n\n   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\n So I think that\'s a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""WINDS"" -> \n   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INLET"".\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.\n\nThe word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).\n- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).\n- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]
  L: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T
Present letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)

We also know about N:
  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.
  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

We know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).

The secret word has 5 letters. We know:
  Position 4: E

And N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has E at position 4.
  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).
  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.

Case 1: N at position 1
  Then the word: N _ _ E _
  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.

Case 2: N at position 3
  Then: _ _ N E _
  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _
  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)

Actually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it's not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.

But note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it's likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.

So the word has exactly one N and one E.

Therefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _
  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

  Possible words: 
    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.

  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.

  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E's? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let's spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.

  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.

  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?

  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).

  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N's? We don't want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any. So avoid.

  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.

  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.

  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.

  ""NOVEL"": 
    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": 
      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.

  ""NOSEY"": 
    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    But we don't know about O, S, Y.

  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let's see.

  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). 
    But X is uncommon.

  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.

  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.

Case 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _
  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? 
      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
    This word: 
      - Has E at 4 (good).
      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).
      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.

  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

  ""BONES"" is a valid word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  Then we need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.

  ""SHOWN"": 
      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.

  ""POWER"": 
      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": 
      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.

  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that's not a word? 
      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? 
      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E's? We don't want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: 
        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.

  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? 
      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that's not a single word? 
      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? 
      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, in ""SENSE"": 
        Position 4 is C? Not E. 
        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? 
        That would be ... E N. 
        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that's not E at 4 and N at 5. 

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that's 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N's? We don't want duplicates.

  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.

Case 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _
  Then we need positions 2,3,5.

  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. 
  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's? 
  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This fits: 
        - E is at 4 (good).
        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). 
        - Uses U, K, S which are available.

  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it's accepted in word games sometimes? But let's see if there's a better one.

  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.

  But ""NOSES"" has two S's. We might get less information.

  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.

  ""NURDS"" -> not common.

  ""NEXUS"": 
      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.

  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?

  So the third letter must be something else. 

  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.

  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's.

  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a better word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  We need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.
  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.

  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. 
      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N's.

  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.

  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.

  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. 
      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Examples: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.
        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.

  How about ""SENTE""? It's a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.

  I think it's hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. 

  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. 

  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Words: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.
        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.

  Actually, I can't think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". 

  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.

So pattern: _ _ N E _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

We have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Candidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.

Also, we are testing B, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.

""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.

""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 

But we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.

Another candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E's? We don't want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don't know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E's? Not good.

""HONES"" -> not a word.

""bones"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

Another candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.

""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

""bones"" is good.

But let me see if there are other words.

""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? 
  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is also a candidate.

We have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".

We can choose either. Let's pick ""bones"" because it's more common.

But note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.

Another word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. 
  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  But we don't know about D and U.

  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.

  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".

  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.

  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.

  Let's choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.

  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.

  We want to maximize information. 

  In ""dunes"": 
    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""bones"": 
    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""zones"": 
    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We don't know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.

  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.

  Another word: ""bones"" is good.

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. 

  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.

  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This fits the pattern? 
        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). 
        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.

  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: 
      Position 1: N
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: S
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.

  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.

  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.

  But we are also testing S and Y.

  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.

  We don't know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.

  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". 

  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven't tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.

  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.

  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.

  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word.

  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? 

  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.

  So we have:
    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S
    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y
    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y

  We can choose one that uses more common letters.

  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.

  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. 

  We are testing B, O, S.

  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  So let's go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.

  But we are not there yet.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters.

  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.

  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But I think ""bones"" is more common.

  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  I think either is fine. Let's choose ""bones"".

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven't tested O before.

  We are going to test O at position 2.

  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.

  Similarly for B and S.

  This will give us good information.

  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".

  But let me confirm: 
    Guess 3: ""bones""

  Pattern: B O N E S

  We know:
    Position 4: E (will be ✓)
    Position 3: N (we are testing if it's at 3)

  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.

  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  But we don't have a good word for case 1 and case 3.

  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven't tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it's new.

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.

  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N's and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.

  I think we should go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? 
    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven't tested. And we test O, S, Y.

  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  And it's a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.

  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.

  Let's choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But we already know E is at 4, so we don't need to test E again? But we are including it.

  Actually, we are testing the entire word.

  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.

  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.

  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters. 

  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. 

  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.

  Words: 
    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.
    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.
    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.

  I think it's safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. 

  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.

  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.

  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".

  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.

  So let's do that.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.

  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). 

  Then we can adjust.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  But let me see: 
    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:
      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.
      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.
      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.

  Similarly for O, S, Y.

  So we get information.

  Therefore, I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  Both are good. I'll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried.

  So guess: ""nosey""

  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. 

  We haven't tried H.

  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". 

  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".

  We can choose one.

  I think I'll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.

  So let's do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find one. 

  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  ""MONEY"" doesn't have N at 5.

  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.

  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".

  Let's choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:
      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.

  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  But we have more guesses.

  So it's acceptable.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see the feedback we might get:

  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:
      For ""nosey"": 
        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓
        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? 
        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don't know.
        E: ✓ (at 4)
        Y: ? 

  But we don't know the secret word.

  We are trying to get the word.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.

  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.

  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.

  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We haven't tried position 1 for N? We haven't tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don't know about other letters at position 1.

  So testing position 1 with N is good.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see: 
    ""nosey"": 
      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.
      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? 
      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?
      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?

  This will give us good information.

  So I'll go with that.

  Final decision: ""nosey""

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:
      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.
      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  So it's a good test.

  Therefore, I'll guess ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to output in the format.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.

  So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").
- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **E at position 4**.
- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).
- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.

For the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:
- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).
- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).
- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).
- Avoid absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.

<guess>nosey</guess>",nosey,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]
  L: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T
Present letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)

We also know about N:
  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.
  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

We know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).

The secret word has 5 letters. We know:
  Position 4: E

And N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has E at position 4.
  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).
  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.

Case 1: N at position 1
  Then the word: N _ _ E _
  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.

Case 2: N at position 3
  Then: _ _ N E _
  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _
  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)

Actually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it's not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.

But note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it's likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.

So the word has exactly one N and one E.

Therefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _
  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

  Possible words: 
    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.

  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.

  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E's? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let's spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.

  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.

  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?

  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).

  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N's? We don't want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any. So avoid.

  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.

  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.

  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.

  ""NOVEL"": 
    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": 
      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.

  ""NOSEY"": 
    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    But we don't know about O, S, Y.

  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let's see.

  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). 
    But X is uncommon.

  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.

  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.

Case 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _
  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? 
      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
    This word: 
      - Has E at 4 (good).
      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).
      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.

  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

  ""BONES"" is a valid word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  Then we need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.

  ""SHOWN"": 
      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.

  ""POWER"": 
      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": 
      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.

  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that's not a word? 
      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? 
      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E's? We don't want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: 
        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.

  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? 
      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that's not a single word? 
      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? 
      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, in ""SENSE"": 
        Position 4 is C? Not E. 
        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? 
        That would be ... E N. 
        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that's not E at 4 and N at 5. 

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that's 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N's? We don't want duplicates.

  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.

Case 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _
  Then we need positions 2,3,5.

  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. 
  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's? 
  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This fits: 
        - E is at 4 (good).
        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). 
        - Uses U, K, S which are available.

  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it's accepted in word games sometimes? But let's see if there's a better one.

  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.

  But ""NOSES"" has two S's. We might get less information.

  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.

  ""NURDS"" -> not common.

  ""NEXUS"": 
      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.

  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?

  So the third letter must be something else. 

  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.

  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's.

  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a better word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  We need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.
  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.

  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. 
      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N's.

  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.

  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.

  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. 
      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Examples: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.
        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.

  How about ""SENTE""? It's a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.

  I think it's hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. 

  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. 

  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Words: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.
        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.

  Actually, I can't think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". 

  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.

So pattern: _ _ N E _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

We have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Candidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.

Also, we are testing B, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.

""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.

""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 

But we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.

Another candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E's? We don't want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don't know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E's? Not good.

""HONES"" -> not a word.

""bones"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

Another candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.

""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

""bones"" is good.

But let me see if there are other words.

""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? 
  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is also a candidate.

We have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".

We can choose either. Let's pick ""bones"" because it's more common.

But note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.

Another word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. 
  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  But we don't know about D and U.

  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.

  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".

  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.

  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.

  Let's choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.

  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.

  We want to maximize information. 

  In ""dunes"": 
    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""bones"": 
    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""zones"": 
    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We don't know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.

  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.

  Another word: ""bones"" is good.

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. 

  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.

  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This fits the pattern? 
        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). 
        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.

  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: 
      Position 1: N
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: S
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.

  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.

  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.

  But we are also testing S and Y.

  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.

  We don't know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.

  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". 

  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven't tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.

  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.

  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.

  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word.

  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? 

  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.

  So we have:
    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S
    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y
    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y

  We can choose one that uses more common letters.

  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.

  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. 

  We are testing B, O, S.

  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  So let's go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.

  But we are not there yet.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters.

  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.

  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But I think ""bones"" is more common.

  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  I think either is fine. Let's choose ""bones"".

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven't tested O before.

  We are going to test O at position 2.

  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.

  Similarly for B and S.

  This will give us good information.

  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".

  But let me confirm: 
    Guess 3: ""bones""

  Pattern: B O N E S

  We know:
    Position 4: E (will be ✓)
    Position 3: N (we are testing if it's at 3)

  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.

  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  But we don't have a good word for case 1 and case 3.

  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven't tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it's new.

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.

  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N's and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.

  I think we should go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? 
    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven't tested. And we test O, S, Y.

  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  And it's a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.

  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.

  Let's choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But we already know E is at 4, so we don't need to test E again? But we are including it.

  Actually, we are testing the entire word.

  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.

  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.

  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters. 

  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. 

  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.

  Words: 
    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.
    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.
    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.

  I think it's safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. 

  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.

  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.

  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".

  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.

  So let's do that.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.

  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). 

  Then we can adjust.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  But let me see: 
    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:
      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.
      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.
      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.

  Similarly for O, S, Y.

  So we get information.

  Therefore, I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  Both are good. I'll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried.

  So guess: ""nosey""

  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. 

  We haven't tried H.

  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". 

  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".

  We can choose one.

  I think I'll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.

  So let's do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find one. 

  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  ""MONEY"" doesn't have N at 5.

  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.

  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".

  Let's choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:
      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.

  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  But we have more guesses.

  So it's acceptable.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see the feedback we might get:

  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:
      For ""nosey"": 
        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓
        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? 
        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don't know.
        E: ✓ (at 4)
        Y: ? 

  But we don't know the secret word.

  We are trying to get the word.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.

  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.

  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.

  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We haven't tried position 1 for N? We haven't tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don't know about other letters at position 1.

  So testing position 1 with N is good.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see: 
    ""nosey"": 
      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.
      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? 
      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?
      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?

  This will give us good information.

  So I'll go with that.

  Final decision: ""nosey""

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:
      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.
      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  So it's a good test.

  Therefore, I'll guess ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to output in the format.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.

  So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").
- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **E at position 4**.
- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).
- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.

For the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:
- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).
- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).
- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).
- Avoid absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.",Guess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters N and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, N was in the 4th position and E in the 5th position of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     N is not at position 4.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 Since N and E are present, we should try to use a word that includes N and E, but in different positions.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - Contains N and E (but not at position 4 for N and not at position 5 for E).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's try to put N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5 respectively.

 Possibilities for N: it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note: we don't know the exact positions, but we know it's not at 4.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That's position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 But in ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D.
   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).

 However, we don't know if the word has L, I, D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that's not a common word? And it has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Let's think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""STONE"" -> 
   S, T, O, N, E.
   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.

 In ""STONE"":
   N is at position 4 -> we know that's not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.

 How about ""STEIN"":
   S, T, E, I, N.
   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": 
   I, N, L, E, T.
   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). 

 This seems good.

 But let's check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> 
   S, P, I, N, E.
   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.

 How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""UNITE"" -> 
   U, N, I, T, E.
   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>inlet</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]
  L: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T
Present letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)

We also know about N:
  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.
  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

We know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).

The secret word has 5 letters. We know:
  Position 4: E

And N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has E at position 4.
  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).
  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.

Case 1: N at position 1
  Then the word: N _ _ E _
  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.

Case 2: N at position 3
  Then: _ _ N E _
  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _
  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)

Actually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it's not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.

But note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it's likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.

So the word has exactly one N and one E.

Therefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _
  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

  Possible words: 
    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.

  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.

  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E's? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let's spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.

  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.

  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?

  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).

  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N's? We don't want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any. So avoid.

  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.

  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.

  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.

  ""NOVEL"": 
    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": 
      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.

  ""NOSEY"": 
    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    But we don't know about O, S, Y.

  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let's see.

  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). 
    But X is uncommon.

  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.

  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.

Case 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _
  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? 
      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
    This word: 
      - Has E at 4 (good).
      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).
      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.

  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

  ""BONES"" is a valid word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  Then we need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.

  ""SHOWN"": 
      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.

  ""POWER"": 
      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": 
      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.

  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that's not a word? 
      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? 
      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E's? We don't want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: 
        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.

  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? 
      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that's not a single word? 
      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? 
      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, in ""SENSE"": 
        Position 4 is C? Not E. 
        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? 
        That would be ... E N. 
        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that's not E at 4 and N at 5. 

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that's 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N's? We don't want duplicates.

  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.

Case 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _
  Then we need positions 2,3,5.

  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. 
  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's? 
  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This fits: 
        - E is at 4 (good).
        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). 
        - Uses U, K, S which are available.

  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it's accepted in word games sometimes? But let's see if there's a better one.

  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.

  But ""NOSES"" has two S's. We might get less information.

  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.

  ""NURDS"" -> not common.

  ""NEXUS"": 
      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.

  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?

  So the third letter must be something else. 

  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.

  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's.

  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a better word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  We need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.
  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.

  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. 
      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N's.

  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.

  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.

  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. 
      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Examples: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.
        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.

  How about ""SENTE""? It's a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.

  I think it's hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. 

  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. 

  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Words: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.
        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.

  Actually, I can't think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". 

  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.

So pattern: _ _ N E _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

We have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Candidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.

Also, we are testing B, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.

""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.

""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 

But we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.

Another candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E's? We don't want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don't know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E's? Not good.

""HONES"" -> not a word.

""bones"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

Another candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.

""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

""bones"" is good.

But let me see if there are other words.

""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? 
  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is also a candidate.

We have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".

We can choose either. Let's pick ""bones"" because it's more common.

But note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.

Another word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. 
  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  But we don't know about D and U.

  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.

  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".

  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.

  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.

  Let's choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.

  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.

  We want to maximize information. 

  In ""dunes"": 
    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""bones"": 
    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""zones"": 
    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We don't know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.

  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.

  Another word: ""bones"" is good.

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. 

  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.

  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This fits the pattern? 
        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). 
        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.

  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: 
      Position 1: N
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: S
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.

  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.

  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.

  But we are also testing S and Y.

  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.

  We don't know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.

  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". 

  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven't tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.

  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.

  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.

  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word.

  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? 

  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.

  So we have:
    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S
    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y
    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y

  We can choose one that uses more common letters.

  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.

  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. 

  We are testing B, O, S.

  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  So let's go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.

  But we are not there yet.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters.

  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.

  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But I think ""bones"" is more common.

  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  I think either is fine. Let's choose ""bones"".

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven't tested O before.

  We are going to test O at position 2.

  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.

  Similarly for B and S.

  This will give us good information.

  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".

  But let me confirm: 
    Guess 3: ""bones""

  Pattern: B O N E S

  We know:
    Position 4: E (will be ✓)
    Position 3: N (we are testing if it's at 3)

  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.

  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  But we don't have a good word for case 1 and case 3.

  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven't tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it's new.

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.

  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N's and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.

  I think we should go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? 
    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven't tested. And we test O, S, Y.

  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  And it's a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.

  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.

  Let's choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But we already know E is at 4, so we don't need to test E again? But we are including it.

  Actually, we are testing the entire word.

  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.

  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.

  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters. 

  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. 

  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.

  Words: 
    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.
    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.
    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.

  I think it's safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. 

  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.

  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.

  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".

  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.

  So let's do that.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.

  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). 

  Then we can adjust.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  But let me see: 
    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:
      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.
      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.
      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.

  Similarly for O, S, Y.

  So we get information.

  Therefore, I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  Both are good. I'll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried.

  So guess: ""nosey""

  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. 

  We haven't tried H.

  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". 

  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".

  We can choose one.

  I think I'll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.

  So let's do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find one. 

  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  ""MONEY"" doesn't have N at 5.

  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.

  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".

  Let's choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:
      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.

  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  But we have more guesses.

  So it's acceptable.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see the feedback we might get:

  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:
      For ""nosey"": 
        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓
        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? 
        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don't know.
        E: ✓ (at 4)
        Y: ? 

  But we don't know the secret word.

  We are trying to get the word.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.

  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.

  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.

  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We haven't tried position 1 for N? We haven't tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don't know about other letters at position 1.

  So testing position 1 with N is good.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see: 
    ""nosey"": 
      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.
      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? 
      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?
      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?

  This will give us good information.

  So I'll go with that.

  Final decision: ""nosey""

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:
      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.
      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  So it's a good test.

  Therefore, I'll guess ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to output in the format.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.

  So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").
- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **E at position 4**.
- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).
- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.

For the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:
- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).
- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).
- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).
- Avoid absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.

<guess>nosey</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

But note: we don\'t know the exact positions, but we know it\'s not at 4.\n\n Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That\'s position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.\n\n But in ""LINED"": \n   L, I, N, E, D.\n   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has L, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that\'s not a common word? And it has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Another idea: ""STONE"" -> \n   S, T, O, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.\n\n In ""STONE"":\n   N is at position 4 -> we know that\'s not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""STEIN"":\n   S, T, E, I, N.\n   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": \n   I, N, L, E, T.\n   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). \n\n This seems good.\n\n But let\'s check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> \n   S, P, I, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""NEEDS"": \n   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""UNITE"" -> \n   U, N, I, T, E.\n   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""UNTIE"": \n   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""INTEG""? But that\'s not a common word.\n\n Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> \n   S, I, N, E, W.\n   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But we have W, which is less common.\n\n How about ""MINES"": \n   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That\'s allowed. But note: we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don\'t know.\n\n To avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5\n   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n We can try:\n   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. \n   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). \n   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don\'t know about them.\n\n How about ""NOISE"": \n   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.\n\n How about ""NOBLE"": \n   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.\n\n How about ""NEXUS"": \n   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.\n\n But we don\'t know about X and U.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": \n   L, I, N, E, S -> \n      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: \n   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).\n\n So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). \n\n Also, we avoid C, R, A.\n\n So ""LINES"" is a candidate.\n\n But wait: we have S at the end. We don\'t know about S.\n\n Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> \n   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.\n\n However, ""MINES"" has two E\'s? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". \n\n We can also consider ""DINER"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\n How about ""DINES"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.\n\n But we don\'t know about D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.\n\n We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let\'s choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". \n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don\'t know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> \n   S, L, E, P, T.\n   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don\'t have to, but if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get information about N\'s position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.\n\n Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: we have to make sure we don\'t put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":\n   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). \n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can\'t because E is at 5. \n\n Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""BONES"": \n   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n But we don\'t know about B, O, S.\n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter S? We don\'t know about S. We can try it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that\'s not a word. \n\n Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. \n\n How about ""INLET"": \n   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). \n   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". \n\n We can choose either. Let\'s pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.\n\n I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""INLET"": \n      Position 1: I -> we don\'t know.\n      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s at 2.\n      Position 3: L -> unknown.\n      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.\n      Position 5: T -> unknown.\n\n This will help us:\n\n   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it\'s present but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   Similarly for E at 4.\n\n Also, we get information about I, L, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let\'s choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""INLET"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.\n\n Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it\'s not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).\n\n So let\'s choose ""INLET"".\n\n However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""INLET"": \n   N is at position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E).\n\n So that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".\n\n But let me double-check: \n   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\n   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\n\n   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\n So I think that\'s a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""WINDS"" -> \n   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INLET"".\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.\n\nThe word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).\n- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).\n- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)\n  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""inlet""\n  I: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]\n  L: x (not in word)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T\nPresent letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)\n\nWe also know about N:\n  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.\n  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters. We know:\n  Position 4: E\n\nAnd N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Has E at position 4.\n  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).\n  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n\nPattern: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.\n\nCase 1: N at position 1\n  Then the word: N _ _ E _\n  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3\n  Then: _ _ N E _\n  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _\n  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)\n\nActually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it\'s not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.\n\nBut note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we can\'t be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.\n\nBut in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it\'s likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.\n\nSo the word has exactly one N and one E.\n\nTherefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _\n  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n  Possible words: \n    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.\n\n  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.\n\n  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E\'s? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let\'s spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.\n\n  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?\n\n  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).\n\n  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t seen any. So avoid.\n\n  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.\n\n  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.\n\n  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.\n\n  ""NOVEL"": \n    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": \n      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.\n\n  ""NOSEY"": \n    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    But we don\'t know about O, S, Y.\n\n  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let\'s see.\n\n  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). \n    But X is uncommon.\n\n  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _\n  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\n  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? \n      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n    This word: \n      - Has E at 4 (good).\n      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).\n      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.\n\n  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\n  ""BONES"" is a valid word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  Then we need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""SHOWN"": \n      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""POWER"": \n      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""DOWNS"": \n      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.\n\n  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that\'s not a word? \n      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? \n      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: \n        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.\n\n  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? \n      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that\'s not a single word? \n      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? \n      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, in ""SENSE"": \n        Position 4 is C? Not E. \n        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? \n        That would be ... E N. \n        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that\'s not E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that\'s 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates.\n\n  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.\n\nCase 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _\n  Then we need positions 2,3,5.\n\n  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. \n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s? \n  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This fits: \n        - E is at 4 (good).\n        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). \n        - Uses U, K, S which are available.\n\n  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it\'s accepted in word games sometimes? But let\'s see if there\'s a better one.\n\n  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.\n\n  But ""NOSES"" has two S\'s. We might get less information.\n\n  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""NURDS"" -> not common.\n\n  ""NEXUS"": \n      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?\n\n  So the third letter must be something else. \n\n  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s.\n\n  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  We need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.\n  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. \n      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.\n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N\'s.\n\n  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.\n\n  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.\n\n  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. \n      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Examples: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.\n\n  How about ""SENTE""? It\'s a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.\n\n  I think it\'s hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. \n\n  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Words: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.\n\n  Actually, I can\'t think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". \n\n  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ N E _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nWe have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nCandidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.\n\nAlso, we are testing B, O, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.\n\n""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.\n\n""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n\nBut we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don\'t know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E\'s? Not good.\n\n""HONES"" -> not a word.\n\n""bones"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.\n\n""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.\n\n""bones"" is good.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words.\n\n""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? \n  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is also a candidate.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".\n\nWe can choose either. Let\'s pick ""bones"" because it\'s more common.\n\nBut note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.\n\nAnother word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. \n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  But we don\'t know about D and U.\n\n  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.\n\n  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".\n\n  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.\n\n  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.\n\n  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.\n\n  We want to maximize information. \n\n  In ""dunes"": \n    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""bones"": \n    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""zones"": \n    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We don\'t know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.\n\n  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is good.\n\n  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. \n\n  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.\n\n  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This fits the pattern? \n        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). \n        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.\n\n  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: \n      Position 1: N\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: S\n      Position 4: E\n      Position 5: Y\n\n  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.\n\n  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.\n\n  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S and Y.\n\n  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.\n\n  We don\'t know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.\n\n  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". \n\n  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven\'t tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.\n\n  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.\n\n  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.\n\n  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word.\n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? \n\n  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.\n\n  So we have:\n    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S\n    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y\n    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y\n\n  We can choose one that uses more common letters.\n\n  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.\n\n  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. \n\n  We are testing B, O, S.\n\n  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.\n\n  But we are not there yet.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters.\n\n  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.\n\n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But I think ""bones"" is more common.\n\n  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  I think either is fine. Let\'s choose ""bones"".\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven\'t tested O before.\n\n  We are going to test O at position 2.\n\n  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.\n\n  Similarly for B and S.\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".\n\n  But let me confirm: \n    Guess 3: ""bones""\n\n  Pattern: B O N E S\n\n  We know:\n    Position 4: E (will be ✓)\n    Position 3: N (we are testing if it\'s at 3)\n\n  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.\n\n  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  But we don\'t have a good word for case 1 and case 3.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven\'t tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it\'s new.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.\n\n  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N\'s and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.\n\n  I think we should go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? \n    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.\n\n  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven\'t tested. And we test O, S, Y.\n\n  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  And it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.\n\n  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But we already know E is at 4, so we don\'t need to test E again? But we are including it.\n\n  Actually, we are testing the entire word.\n\n  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.\n\n  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters. \n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. \n\n  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.\n\n  Words: \n    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.\n    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.\n    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.\n\n  I think it\'s safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. \n\n  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.\n\n  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.\n\n  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".\n\n  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.\n\n  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). \n\n  Then we can adjust.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  But let me see: \n    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:\n      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.\n      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.\n      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.\n\n  Similarly for O, S, Y.\n\n  So we get information.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  Both are good. I\'ll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n  So guess: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. \n\n  We haven\'t tried H.\n\n  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". \n\n  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".\n\n  We can choose one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find one. \n\n  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  ""MONEY"" doesn\'t have N at 5.\n\n  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.\n\n  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:\n      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.\n\n  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  But we have more guesses.\n\n  So it\'s acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see the feedback we might get:\n\n  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:\n      For ""nosey"": \n        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓\n        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? \n        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don\'t know.\n        E: ✓ (at 4)\n        Y: ? \n\n  But we don\'t know the secret word.\n\n  We are trying to get the word.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.\n\n  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.\n\n  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.\n\n  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We haven\'t tried position 1 for N? We haven\'t tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don\'t know about other letters at position 1.\n\n  So testing position 1 with N is good.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see: \n    ""nosey"": \n      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.\n      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? \n      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?\n      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)\n      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.\n\n  Final decision: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:\n      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.\n      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  So it\'s a good test.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll guess ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to output in the format.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").\n- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **E at position 4**.\n- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).\n- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.\n\nFor the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:\n- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).\n- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).\n- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>nosey</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 4)
  E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 2)
  L: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""nosey""
  N: - (present, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  S: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")
   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))

2. So the secret word has: _ O _ E Y

3. Known absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (from ""nosey"": S(x))

4. Known present letters: N (but not at position 1,2,4? 
   - Not at 1 (from ""nosey"": N(-))
   - Not at 2 (from ""inlet"": N(-))
   - Not at 4 (from ""crane"": N(-) and ""inlet"": N(-) which confirms position 4 is E)
   - Not at 5? We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don't have direct feedback on N at 3? 
     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.
     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.
     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.
     - Therefore, N must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4,5 are all ruled out? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ""nosey""
        - Position 2: ruled out by ""inlet""
        - Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" and ""inlet"" (which has E at 4)
        - Position 5: ruled out by ""nosey"" (Y is at 5)
        - Therefore, only position 3 is left for N.

   So N must be at position 3.

5. Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

6. We only need to find the first letter.

7. The first letter must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.
   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".

8. Possible words: 
   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let's see: 
        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O's, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O's, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don't have another O in the guess. So we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. 

   So likely, the first letter is not O. 

   We need a word: [letter] ONERY

   Common words: 
     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. 
        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. And it's not in the absent list.

     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.

     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let's check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.

     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.

     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.

     ""PONEY"" -> not common.

     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.

     ""WONEY"" -> not common.

     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. 
        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.
        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.
        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.

   But we don't know which one. We need to test the first letter.

   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.

   But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one of these.

   How to choose? We can pick one that uses a common letter? Or we can pick one that might be the word.

   We don't have any information about the first letter. We have to guess.

   But we can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in previous guesses. So we don't know about them.

   We can choose ""HONEY"" because H is a common letter? Or ""MONEY"" because M is common? 

   Alternatively, we can think: we have to fill the first position. We can try ""HONEY"".

   But note: if we guess ""HONEY"", and it's not the word, we get feedback and then we can try another.

   However, we have three candidates: ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"". 

   But wait: are there more? 
      ""PONEY"" -> not common.
      ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.
      ""WONEY"" -> not common.

   So likely, it's one of these three.

   We can also consider: we have not tested B, H, M in any guess? So we don't have information. 

   But we can choose ""HONEY"" because it's a common word.

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Or ""DONERY""? Not a word.

   So the candidates are: BONEY, HONEY, MONEY.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" and if it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one of those.

   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.

   So we can guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me see: 
        If we guess ""HONEY"":
          If it's correct, we win.
          If not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes B, H, M? But we only have one position to fill. We are forced to guess one of these.

   But note: we don't know if the word has H, B, or M. We haven't tested any of them.

   So we have to choose one.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good guess because H is a common letter.

   But we can also consider: we have already used O, N, E, Y in the current guess? We are going to use them again? Actually, we have to: because the word is almost known.

   The secret word pattern: ? O N E Y

   We don't know the first letter, so we have to guess one of the candidates.

   We can choose ""HONEY"".

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get feedback that H is absent? And we know it's B.

   Similarly, if we guess ""HONEY"" and the feedback shows:
        H: if absent, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

   However, we can also consider: we have not tested the letter B, H, M in any context. So we don't have information. 

   But we can try to use a word that has multiple candidates? But we can't because we only have one position.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of the candidates but that tests the first letter with B, H, M? But we cannot because we must have the pattern: ? O N E Y. 

   Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good choice.

   So let's go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not sure if the word is ""HONEY"". We are just guessing.

   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".

   We'll guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":

        H: absent -> x
        O: correct -> ✓
        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")
        E: correct -> ✓
        Y: correct -> ✓

        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.

   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".

   But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate but that tests the first letter? But we cannot because we must have the known letters.

   Therefore, we guess ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not forced to use the known letters? We could use a different word? But then we would be wasting the known letters? Because we know they are in the word and in those positions.

   We should use the known letters to get the word.

   So I think ""HONEY"" is the best guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY""? Then we guess one.

   We can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in any guess. So we don't have information. 

   But we don't need to test the letters in the other positions? Because we are only missing the first letter.

   So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

   I'll choose ""HONEY"".

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two more after this.

   So let's do that.

   However, we must output the guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another possibility: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So I think it's safe.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""HONEY"".

   But let me see the pattern: 
        Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,I,L,T,S} and must form a word)
        Position 2: O (fixed)
        Position 3: N (fixed)
        Position 4: E (fixed)
        Position 5: Y (fixed)

   So the word must be ?ONERY.

   We have three possibilities: B, H, M.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" to test H.

   If it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

   So I'll go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we have to output the guess.

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   Format: <guess>honey</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** and **Y at position 5** (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 2** (from Guess 3).
- **N is present** but ruled out of positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (from Guesses 1-3). The only remaining position is 3, so **N must be at position 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (marked `x`).
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O N E Y`

The first letter must:
- Be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
- Form a 5-letter word with ""ONERY"".
- Not be C, R, A, I, L, T, S.

Possible candidates: **BONEY**, **HONEY**, **MONEY**.

""HONEY"" is chosen to test **H** (a common letter) at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate H and try another candidate.

<guess>honey</guess>",honey,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 4)
  E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 2)
  L: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""nosey""
  N: - (present, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  S: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")
   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))

2. So the secret word has: _ O _ E Y

3. Known absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (from ""nosey"": S(x))

4. Known present letters: N (but not at position 1,2,4? 
   - Not at 1 (from ""nosey"": N(-))
   - Not at 2 (from ""inlet"": N(-))
   - Not at 4 (from ""crane"": N(-) and ""inlet"": N(-) which confirms position 4 is E)
   - Not at 5? We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don't have direct feedback on N at 3? 
     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.
     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.
     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.
     - Therefore, N must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4,5 are all ruled out? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ""nosey""
        - Position 2: ruled out by ""inlet""
        - Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" and ""inlet"" (which has E at 4)
        - Position 5: ruled out by ""nosey"" (Y is at 5)
        - Therefore, only position 3 is left for N.

   So N must be at position 3.

5. Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

6. We only need to find the first letter.

7. The first letter must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.
   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".

8. Possible words: 
   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let's see: 
        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O's, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O's, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don't have another O in the guess. So we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. 

   So likely, the first letter is not O. 

   We need a word: [letter] ONERY

   Common words: 
     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. 
        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. And it's not in the absent list.

     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.

     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let's check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.

     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.

     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.

     ""PONEY"" -> not common.

     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.

     ""WONEY"" -> not common.

     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. 
        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.
        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.
        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.

   But we don't know which one. We need to test the first letter.

   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.

   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.

   So we can guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me see:

   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".

   We'll guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":

        H: absent -> x
        O: correct -> ✓
        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")
        E: correct -> ✓
        Y: correct -> ✓

        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.

   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".

   But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters N and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, N was in the 4th position and E in the 5th position of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     N is not at position 4.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 Since N and E are present, we should try to use a word that includes N and E, but in different positions.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - Contains N and E (but not at position 4 for N and not at position 5 for E).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's try to put N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5 respectively.

 Possibilities for N: it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note: we don't know the exact positions, but we know it's not at 4.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That's position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 But in ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D.
   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).

 However, we don't know if the word has L, I, D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that's not a common word? And it has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Let's think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""STONE"" -> 
   S, T, O, N, E.
   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.

 In ""STONE"":
   N is at position 4 -> we know that's not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.

 How about ""STEIN"":
   S, T, E, I, N.
   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": 
   I, N, L, E, T.
   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). 

 This seems good.

 But let's check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> 
   S, P, I, N, E.
   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.

 How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""UNITE"" -> 
   U, N, I, T, E.
   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>inlet</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]
  L: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T
Present letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)

We also know about N:
  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.
  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

We know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).

The secret word has 5 letters. We know:
  Position 4: E

And N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has E at position 4.
  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).
  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.

Case 1: N at position 1
  Then the word: N _ _ E _
  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.

Case 2: N at position 3
  Then: _ _ N E _
  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _
  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)

Actually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it's not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.

But note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it's likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.

So the word has exactly one N and one E.

Therefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _
  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

  Possible words: 
    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.

  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.

  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E's? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let's spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.

  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.

  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?

  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).

  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N's? We don't want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any. So avoid.

  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.

  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.

  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.

  ""NOVEL"": 
    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": 
      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.

  ""NOSEY"": 
    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    But we don't know about O, S, Y.

  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let's see.

  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). 
    But X is uncommon.

  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.

  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.

Case 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _
  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? 
      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
    This word: 
      - Has E at 4 (good).
      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).
      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.

  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

  ""BONES"" is a valid word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  Then we need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.

  ""SHOWN"": 
      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.

  ""POWER"": 
      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": 
      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.

  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that's not a word? 
      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? 
      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E's? We don't want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: 
        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.

  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? 
      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that's not a single word? 
      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? 
      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, in ""SENSE"": 
        Position 4 is C? Not E. 
        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? 
        That would be ... E N. 
        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that's not E at 4 and N at 5. 

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that's 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N's? We don't want duplicates.

  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.

Case 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _
  Then we need positions 2,3,5.

  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. 
  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's? 
  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This fits: 
        - E is at 4 (good).
        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). 
        - Uses U, K, S which are available.

  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it's accepted in word games sometimes? But let's see if there's a better one.

  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.

  But ""NOSES"" has two S's. We might get less information.

  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.

  ""NURDS"" -> not common.

  ""NEXUS"": 
      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.

  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?

  So the third letter must be something else. 

  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.

  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's.

  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a better word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  We need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.
  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.

  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. 
      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N's.

  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.

  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.

  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. 
      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Examples: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.
        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.

  How about ""SENTE""? It's a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.

  I think it's hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. 

  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. 

  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Words: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.
        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.

  Actually, I can't think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". 

  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.

So pattern: _ _ N E _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

We have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Candidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.

Also, we are testing B, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.

""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.

""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 

But we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.

Another candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E's? We don't want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don't know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E's? Not good.

""HONES"" -> not a word.

""bones"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

Another candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.

""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

""bones"" is good.

But let me see if there are other words.

""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? 
  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is also a candidate.

We have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".

We can choose either. Let's pick ""bones"" because it's more common.

But note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.

Another word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. 
  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  But we don't know about D and U.

  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.

  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".

  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.

  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.

  Let's choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.

  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.

  We want to maximize information. 

  In ""dunes"": 
    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""bones"": 
    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""zones"": 
    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We don't know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.

  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.

  Another word: ""bones"" is good.

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. 

  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.

  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This fits the pattern? 
        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). 
        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.

  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: 
      Position 1: N
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: S
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.

  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.

  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.

  But we are also testing S and Y.

  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.

  We don't know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.

  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". 

  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven't tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.

  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.

  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.

  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word.

  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? 

  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.

  So we have:
    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S
    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y
    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y

  We can choose one that uses more common letters.

  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.

  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. 

  We are testing B, O, S.

  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  So let's go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.

  But we are not there yet.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters.

  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.

  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But I think ""bones"" is more common.

  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  I think either is fine. Let's choose ""bones"".

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven't tested O before.

  We are going to test O at position 2.

  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.

  Similarly for B and S.

  This will give us good information.

  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".

  But let me confirm: 
    Guess 3: ""bones""

  Pattern: B O N E S

  We know:
    Position 4: E (will be ✓)
    Position 3: N (we are testing if it's at 3)

  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.

  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  But we don't have a good word for case 1 and case 3.

  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven't tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it's new.

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.

  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N's and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.

  I think we should go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? 
    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven't tested. And we test O, S, Y.

  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  And it's a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.

  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.

  Let's choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But we already know E is at 4, so we don't need to test E again? But we are including it.

  Actually, we are testing the entire word.

  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.

  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.

  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters. 

  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. 

  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.

  Words: 
    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.
    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.
    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.

  I think it's safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. 

  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.

  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.

  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".

  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.

  So let's do that.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.

  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). 

  Then we can adjust.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  But let me see: 
    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:
      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.
      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.
      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.

  Similarly for O, S, Y.

  So we get information.

  Therefore, I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  Both are good. I'll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried.

  So guess: ""nosey""

  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. 

  We haven't tried H.

  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". 

  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".

  We can choose one.

  I think I'll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.

  So let's do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find one. 

  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  ""MONEY"" doesn't have N at 5.

  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.

  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".

  Let's choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:
      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.

  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  But we have more guesses.

  So it's acceptable.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see the feedback we might get:

  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:
      For ""nosey"": 
        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓
        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? 
        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don't know.
        E: ✓ (at 4)
        Y: ? 

  But we don't know the secret word.

  We are trying to get the word.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.

  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.

  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.

  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We haven't tried position 1 for N? We haven't tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don't know about other letters at position 1.

  So testing position 1 with N is good.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see: 
    ""nosey"": 
      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.
      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? 
      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?
      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?

  This will give us good information.

  So I'll go with that.

  Final decision: ""nosey""

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:
      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.
      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  So it's a good test.

  Therefore, I'll guess ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to output in the format.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.

  So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").
- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **E at position 4**.
- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).
- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.

For the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:
- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).
- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).
- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).
- Avoid absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.

<guess>nosey</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 4)
  E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 2)
  L: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""nosey""
  N: - (present, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  S: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")
   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))

2. So the secret word has: _ O _ E Y

3. Known absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (from ""nosey"": S(x))

4. Known present letters: N (but not at position 1,2,4? 
   - Not at 1 (from ""nosey"": N(-))
   - Not at 2 (from ""inlet"": N(-))
   - Not at 4 (from ""crane"": N(-) and ""inlet"": N(-) which confirms position 4 is E)
   - Not at 5? We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don't have direct feedback on N at 3? 
     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.
     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.
     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.
     - Therefore, N must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4,5 are all ruled out? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ""nosey""
        - Position 2: ruled out by ""inlet""
        - Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" and ""inlet"" (which has E at 4)
        - Position 5: ruled out by ""nosey"" (Y is at 5)
        - Therefore, only position 3 is left for N.

   So N must be at position 3.

5. Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

6. We only need to find the first letter.

7. The first letter must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.
   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".

8. Possible words: 
   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let's see: 
        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O's, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O's, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don't have another O in the guess. So we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. 

   So likely, the first letter is not O. 

   We need a word: [letter] ONERY

   Common words: 
     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. 
        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. And it's not in the absent list.

     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.

     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let's check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.

     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.

     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.

     ""PONEY"" -> not common.

     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.

     ""WONEY"" -> not common.

     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. 
        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.
        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.
        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.

   But we don't know which one. We need to test the first letter.

   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.

   But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one of these.

   How to choose? We can pick one that uses a common letter? Or we can pick one that might be the word.

   We don't have any information about the first letter. We have to guess.

   But we can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in previous guesses. So we don't know about them.

   We can choose ""HONEY"" because H is a common letter? Or ""MONEY"" because M is common? 

   Alternatively, we can think: we have to fill the first position. We can try ""HONEY"".

   But note: if we guess ""HONEY"", and it's not the word, we get feedback and then we can try another.

   However, we have three candidates: ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"". 

   But wait: are there more? 
      ""PONEY"" -> not common.
      ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.
      ""WONEY"" -> not common.

   So likely, it's one of these three.

   We can also consider: we have not tested B, H, M in any guess? So we don't have information. 

   But we can choose ""HONEY"" because it's a common word.

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Or ""DONERY""? Not a word.

   So the candidates are: BONEY, HONEY, MONEY.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" and if it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one of those.

   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.

   So we can guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me see: 
        If we guess ""HONEY"":
          If it's correct, we win.
          If not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes B, H, M? But we only have one position to fill. We are forced to guess one of these.

   But note: we don't know if the word has H, B, or M. We haven't tested any of them.

   So we have to choose one.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good guess because H is a common letter.

   But we can also consider: we have already used O, N, E, Y in the current guess? We are going to use them again? Actually, we have to: because the word is almost known.

   The secret word pattern: ? O N E Y

   We don't know the first letter, so we have to guess one of the candidates.

   We can choose ""HONEY"".

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get feedback that H is absent? And we know it's B.

   Similarly, if we guess ""HONEY"" and the feedback shows:
        H: if absent, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

   However, we can also consider: we have not tested the letter B, H, M in any context. So we don't have information. 

   But we can try to use a word that has multiple candidates? But we can't because we only have one position.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of the candidates but that tests the first letter with B, H, M? But we cannot because we must have the pattern: ? O N E Y. 

   Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good choice.

   So let's go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not sure if the word is ""HONEY"". We are just guessing.

   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".

   We'll guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":

        H: absent -> x
        O: correct -> ✓
        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")
        E: correct -> ✓
        Y: correct -> ✓

        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.

   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".

   But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate but that tests the first letter? But we cannot because we must have the known letters.

   Therefore, we guess ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not forced to use the known letters? We could use a different word? But then we would be wasting the known letters? Because we know they are in the word and in those positions.

   We should use the known letters to get the word.

   So I think ""HONEY"" is the best guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY""? Then we guess one.

   We can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in any guess. So we don't have information. 

   But we don't need to test the letters in the other positions? Because we are only missing the first letter.

   So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

   I'll choose ""HONEY"".

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two more after this.

   So let's do that.

   However, we must output the guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another possibility: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So I think it's safe.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""HONEY"".

   But let me see the pattern: 
        Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,I,L,T,S} and must form a word)
        Position 2: O (fixed)
        Position 3: N (fixed)
        Position 4: E (fixed)
        Position 5: Y (fixed)

   So the word must be ?ONERY.

   We have three possibilities: B, H, M.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" to test H.

   If it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

   So I'll go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we have to output the guess.

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   Format: <guess>honey</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** and **Y at position 5** (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 2** (from Guess 3).
- **N is present** but ruled out of positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (from Guesses 1-3). The only remaining position is 3, so **N must be at position 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (marked `x`).
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O N E Y`

The first letter must:
- Be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
- Form a 5-letter word with ""ONERY"".
- Not be C, R, A, I, L, T, S.

Possible candidates: **BONEY**, **HONEY**, **MONEY**.

""HONEY"" is chosen to test **H** (a common letter) at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate H and try another candidate.

That\'s position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.\n\n But in ""LINED"": \n   L, I, N, E, D.\n   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has L, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that\'s not a common word? And it has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Another idea: ""STONE"" -> \n   S, T, O, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.\n\n In ""STONE"":\n   N is at position 4 -> we know that\'s not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""STEIN"":\n   S, T, E, I, N.\n   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": \n   I, N, L, E, T.\n   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). \n\n This seems good.\n\n But let\'s check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> \n   S, P, I, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""NEEDS"": \n   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""UNITE"" -> \n   U, N, I, T, E.\n   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""UNTIE"": \n   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""INTEG""? But that\'s not a common word.\n\n Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> \n   S, I, N, E, W.\n   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But we have W, which is less common.\n\n How about ""MINES"": \n   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That\'s allowed. But note: we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don\'t know.\n\n To avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5\n   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n We can try:\n   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. \n   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). \n   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don\'t know about them.\n\n How about ""NOISE"": \n   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.\n\n How about ""NOBLE"": \n   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.\n\n How about ""NEXUS"": \n   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.\n\n But we don\'t know about X and U.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": \n   L, I, N, E, S -> \n      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: \n   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).\n\n So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). \n\n Also, we avoid C, R, A.\n\n So ""LINES"" is a candidate.\n\n But wait: we have S at the end. We don\'t know about S.\n\n Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> \n   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.\n\n However, ""MINES"" has two E\'s? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". \n\n We can also consider ""DINER"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\n How about ""DINES"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.\n\n But we don\'t know about D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.\n\n We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let\'s choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". \n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don\'t know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> \n   S, L, E, P, T.\n   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don\'t have to, but if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get information about N\'s position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.\n\n Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: we have to make sure we don\'t put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":\n   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). \n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can\'t because E is at 5. \n\n Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""BONES"": \n   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n But we don\'t know about B, O, S.\n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter S? We don\'t know about S. We can try it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that\'s not a word. \n\n Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. \n\n How about ""INLET"": \n   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). \n   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". \n\n We can choose either. Let\'s pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.\n\n I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""INLET"": \n      Position 1: I -> we don\'t know.\n      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s at 2.\n      Position 3: L -> unknown.\n      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.\n      Position 5: T -> unknown.\n\n This will help us:\n\n   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it\'s present but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   Similarly for E at 4.\n\n Also, we get information about I, L, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let\'s choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""INLET"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.\n\n Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it\'s not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).\n\n So let\'s choose ""INLET"".\n\n However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""INLET"": \n   N is at position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E).\n\n So that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".\n\n But let me double-check: \n   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\n   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\n\n   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\n So I think that\'s a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""WINDS"" -> \n   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INLET"".\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.\n\nThe word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).\n- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).\n- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)\n  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""inlet""\n  I: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]\n  L: x (not in word)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T\nPresent letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)\n\nWe also know about N:\n  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.\n  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters. We know:\n  Position 4: E\n\nAnd N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses).

So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.\n\nBut note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we can\'t be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.\n\nBut in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it\'s likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.\n\nSo the word has exactly one N and one E.\n\nTherefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _\n  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n  Possible words: \n    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.\n\n  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.\n\n  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E\'s? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let\'s spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.\n\n  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?\n\n  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).\n\n  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t seen any. So avoid.\n\n  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.\n\n  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.\n\n  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.\n\n  ""NOVEL"": \n    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": \n      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.\n\n  ""NOSEY"": \n    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    But we don\'t know about O, S, Y.\n\n  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let\'s see.\n\n  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). \n    But X is uncommon.\n\n  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _\n  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\n  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? \n      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n    This word: \n      - Has E at 4 (good).\n      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).\n      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.\n\n  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\n  ""BONES"" is a valid word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  Then we need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""SHOWN"": \n      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""POWER"": \n      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""DOWNS"": \n      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.\n\n  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that\'s not a word? \n      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? \n      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: \n        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.\n\n  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? \n      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that\'s not a single word? \n      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? \n      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, in ""SENSE"": \n        Position 4 is C? Not E. \n        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? \n        That would be ... E N. \n        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that\'s not E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that\'s 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates.\n\n  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.\n\nCase 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _\n  Then we need positions 2,3,5.\n\n  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. \n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s? \n  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This fits: \n        - E is at 4 (good).\n        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). \n        - Uses U, K, S which are available.\n\n  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it\'s accepted in word games sometimes? But let\'s see if there\'s a better one.\n\n  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.\n\n  But ""NOSES"" has two S\'s. We might get less information.\n\n  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""NURDS"" -> not common.\n\n  ""NEXUS"": \n      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?\n\n  So the third letter must be something else. \n\n  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s.\n\n  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  We need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.\n  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. \n      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.\n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N\'s.\n\n  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.\n\n  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.\n\n  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. \n      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Examples: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.\n\n  How about ""SENTE""? It\'s a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.\n\n  I think it\'s hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. \n\n  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Words: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.\n\n  Actually, I can\'t think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". \n\n  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ N E _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nWe have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nCandidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.\n\nAlso, we are testing B, O, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.\n\n""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.\n\n""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n\nBut we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don\'t know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E\'s? Not good.\n\n""HONES"" -> not a word.\n\n""bones"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.\n\n""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.\n\n""bones"" is good.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words.\n\n""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? \n  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is also a candidate.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".\n\nWe can choose either. Let\'s pick ""bones"" because it\'s more common.\n\nBut note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.\n\nAnother word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. \n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  But we don\'t know about D and U.\n\n  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.\n\n  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".\n\n  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.\n\n  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.\n\n  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.\n\n  We want to maximize information. \n\n  In ""dunes"": \n    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""bones"": \n    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""zones"": \n    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We don\'t know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.\n\n  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is good.\n\n  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. \n\n  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.\n\n  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This fits the pattern? \n        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). \n        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.\n\n  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: \n      Position 1: N\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: S\n      Position 4: E\n      Position 5: Y\n\n  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.\n\n  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.\n\n  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S and Y.\n\n  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.\n\n  We don\'t know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.\n\n  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". \n\n  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven\'t tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.\n\n  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.\n\n  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.\n\n  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word.\n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? \n\n  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.\n\n  So we have:\n    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S\n    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y\n    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y\n\n  We can choose one that uses more common letters.\n\n  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.\n\n  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. \n\n  We are testing B, O, S.\n\n  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.\n\n  But we are not there yet.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters.\n\n  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.\n\n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But I think ""bones"" is more common.\n\n  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  I think either is fine. Let\'s choose ""bones"".\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven\'t tested O before.\n\n  We are going to test O at position 2.\n\n  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.\n\n  Similarly for B and S.\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".\n\n  But let me confirm: \n    Guess 3: ""bones""\n\n  Pattern: B O N E S\n\n  We know:\n    Position 4: E (will be ✓)\n    Position 3: N (we are testing if it\'s at 3)\n\n  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.\n\n  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  But we don\'t have a good word for case 1 and case 3.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven\'t tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it\'s new.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.\n\n  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N\'s and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.\n\n  I think we should go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? \n    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.\n\n  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven\'t tested. And we test O, S, Y.\n\n  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  And it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.\n\n  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But we already know E is at 4, so we don\'t need to test E again? But we are including it.\n\n  Actually, we are testing the entire word.\n\n  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.\n\n  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters. \n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. \n\n  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.\n\n  Words: \n    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.\n    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.\n    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.\n\n  I think it\'s safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. \n\n  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.\n\n  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.\n\n  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".\n\n  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.\n\n  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). \n\n  Then we can adjust.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  But let me see: \n    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:\n      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.\n      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.\n      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.\n\n  Similarly for O, S, Y.\n\n  So we get information.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  Both are good. I\'ll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n  So guess: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. \n\n  We haven\'t tried H.\n\n  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". \n\n  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".\n\n  We can choose one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find one. \n\n  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  ""MONEY"" doesn\'t have N at 5.\n\n  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.\n\n  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:\n      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.\n\n  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  But we have more guesses.\n\n  So it\'s acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see the feedback we might get:\n\n  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:\n      For ""nosey"": \n        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓\n        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? \n        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don\'t know.\n        E: ✓ (at 4)\n        Y: ? \n\n  But we don\'t know the secret word.\n\n  We are trying to get the word.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.\n\n  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.\n\n  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.\n\n  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We haven\'t tried position 1 for N? We haven\'t tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don\'t know about other letters at position 1.\n\n  So testing position 1 with N is good.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see: \n    ""nosey"": \n      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.\n      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? \n      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?\n      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)\n      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.\n\n  Final decision: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:\n      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.\n      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  So it\'s a good test.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll guess ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to output in the format.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").\n- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **E at position 4**.\n- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).\n- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.\n\nFor the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:\n- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).\n- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).\n- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>nosey</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (absent)\n  R: x (absent)\n  A: x (absent)\n  N: - (present, but not at position 4)\n  E: - (present, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""inlet""\n  I: x (absent)\n  N: - (present, but not at position 2)\n  L: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  T: x (absent)\n\nGuess 3: ""nosey""\n  N: - (present, but not at position 1)\n  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  S: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. Correct positions:\n   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))\n   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")\n   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))\n\n2.

We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don\'t have direct feedback on N at 3? \n     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.\n     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.\n     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.\n     - Therefore, N must be at position 3?

Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y\n\n6. We only need to find the first letter.\n\n7. The first letter must be a letter that:\n   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.\n   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".\n\n8. Possible words: \n   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don\'t know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let\'s see: \n        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O\'s, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O\'s, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don\'t have another O in the guess. So we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. \n\n   So likely, the first letter is not O. \n\n   We need a word: [letter] ONERY\n\n   Common words: \n     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. \n        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B. And it\'s not in the absent list.\n\n     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.\n\n     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let\'s check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.\n\n     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.\n\n     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.\n\n     ""PONEY"" -> not common.\n\n     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.\n\n     ""WONEY"" -> not common.\n\n     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. \n        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.\n        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.\n        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.\n\n   But we don\'t know which one. We need to test the first letter.\n\n   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.\n\n   But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one of these.\n\n   How to choose? We can pick one that uses a common letter? Or we can pick one that might be the word.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the first letter. We have to guess.\n\n   But we can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in previous guesses. So we don\'t know about them.\n\n   We can choose ""HONEY"" because H is a common letter? Or ""MONEY"" because M is common? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: we have to fill the first position. We can try ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: if we guess ""HONEY"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback and then we can try another.\n\n   However, we have three candidates: ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"". \n\n   But wait: are there more? \n      ""PONEY"" -> not common.\n      ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.\n      ""WONEY"" -> not common.\n\n   So likely, it\'s one of these three.\n\n   We can also consider: we have not tested B, H, M in any guess? So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we can choose ""HONEY"" because it\'s a common word.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Or ""DONERY""? Not a word.\n\n   So the candidates are: BONEY, HONEY, MONEY.\n\n   We can guess ""HONEY"" and if it\'s not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one of those.\n\n   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.\n\n   So we can guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me see: \n        If we guess ""HONEY"":\n          If it\'s correct, we win.\n          If not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes B, H, M? But we only have one position to fill. We are forced to guess one of these.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if the word has H, B, or M. We haven\'t tested any of them.\n\n   So we have to choose one.\n\n   I think ""HONEY"" is a good guess because H is a common letter.\n\n   But we can also consider: we have already used O, N, E, Y in the current guess? We are going to use them again? Actually, we have to: because the word is almost known.\n\n   The secret word pattern: ? O N E Y\n\n   We don\'t know the first letter, so we have to guess one of the candidates.\n\n   We can choose ""HONEY"".\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get feedback that H is absent? And we know it\'s B.\n\n   Similarly, if we guess ""HONEY"" and the feedback shows:\n        H: if absent, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s safe.\n\n   However, we can also consider: we have not tested the letter B, H, M in any context. So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we can try to use a word that has multiple candidates? But we can\'t because we only have one position.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of the candidates but that tests the first letter with B, H, M? But we cannot because we must have the pattern: ? O N E Y. \n\n   Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.\n\n   I think ""HONEY"" is a good choice.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word is ""HONEY"". We are just guessing.\n\n   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.\n\n   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".\n\n   We\'ll guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":\n\n        H: absent -> x\n        O: correct -> ✓\n        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")\n        E: correct -> ✓\n        Y: correct -> ✓\n\n        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)\n\n        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.\n\n   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate but that tests the first letter? But we cannot because we must have the known letters.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are not forced to use the known letters? We could use a different word? But then we would be wasting the known letters? Because we know they are in the word and in those positions.\n\n   We should use the known letters to get the word.\n\n   So I think ""HONEY"" is the best guess.\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY""? Then we guess one.\n\n   We can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in any guess. So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we don\'t need to test the letters in the other positions? Because we are only missing the first letter.\n\n   So I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\n   I\'ll choose ""HONEY"".\n\n   So the guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two more after this.\n\n   So let\'s do that.\n\n   However, we must output the guess.\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Another possibility: ""DONERY"" is not a word.\n\n   So I think it\'s safe.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me see the pattern: \n        Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,I,L,T,S} and must form a word)\n        Position 2: O (fixed)\n        Position 3: N (fixed)\n        Position 4: E (fixed)\n        Position 5: Y (fixed)\n\n   So the word must be ?ONERY.\n\n   We have three possibilities: B, H, M.\n\n   We can guess ""HONEY"" to test H.\n\n   If it\'s not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we guess one.\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s okay.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we have to output the guess.\n\n   So the guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   Format: <guess>honey</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** and **Y at position 5** (from Guess 2 and 3).\n- **O is confirmed at position 2** (from Guess 3).\n- **N is present** but ruled out of positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (from Guesses 1-3). The only remaining position is 3, so **N must be at position 3**.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (marked `x`).\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O N E Y`\n\nThe first letter must:\n- Be a valid English letter not in the absent list.\n- Form a 5-letter word with ""ONERY"".\n- Not be C, R, A, I, L, T, S.\n\nPossible candidates: **BONEY**, **HONEY**, **MONEY**.\n\n""HONEY"" is chosen to test **H** (a common letter) at position 1.

We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""honey"":
  H: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  N: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

This tells us:
- H is absent (so the first letter is not H)
- O, N, E, Y are all correct in their positions: positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed as O, N, E, Y.

Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (from previous feedback)
- Forms a valid English word with ""ONERY""

From previous guesses, we have ruled out:
- C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H as possible first letters.

The only common words left are:
- BONEY: B at position 1
- MONEY: M at position 1

We also had ""NONEY"" (not a word) and ""BONNY"" (but that would be B-O-N-N-Y, which has two N's, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates. Also, ""BONNY"" has N at position 3 and 4? But we already have N at position 3, and if we put N at 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two minuses? But we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only got one minus. Similarly in other guesses. So it's likely no duplicates. Therefore, we assume the first letter is not N (because if it were, we would have seen duplicates in the feedback? Not necessarily: because we never put N at position 1 in a guess? Actually, in ""nosey"", we put N at 1 and got a minus, so N is not at 1. But we don't know about duplicates: if the word had two N's, we might have gotten a minus for N at 1 even if another N is at 3? But in ""nosey"", we have only one N (at position 1) and it was marked as minus, meaning there is an N but not at 1. It doesn't say anything about a duplicate N at 3. However, in ""honey"", we have N at 3 and it was correct, so if there were a duplicate N at 1, we wouldn't know because we never tested N at 1 in a way that would show a duplicate? 

But let's think: if the word were ""NONEY"", then in ""honey"" we have:
  H (absent) -> correct because ""NONEY"" has no H.
  O, N, E, Y: correct.

But in ""NONEY"", the first letter is N. We never tested N at position 1? But in ""nosey"", we tested N at 1 and got a minus, meaning that N is not at 1. But if the word is ""NONEY"", then N is at 1. So that would contradict the feedback of ""nosey"": because we got a minus for N at 1, meaning that N is not at 1. Therefore, ""NONEY"" is impossible.

Similarly, we have to check if there is a word ""BONNY"": 
  B-O-N-N-Y -> but then the first letter is B, and the third letter is N. But in ""honey"", we have N at position 3 and it was correct. If the word is ""BONNY"", then in ""honey"":
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (position 2)
      N: correct (position 3) -> but ""BONNY"" has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. We guessed N at 3 and it was correct. But what about the N at 4? We didn't guess it. So we don't know. 
      However, in ""honey"", we only have one N (at 3), so we get a check for N. But if the word is ""BONNY"", then the fourth letter is N, which we didn't guess. So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at 4 that is N in ""honey"". 

  But the feedback for ""honey"" only tells us about the letters we guessed. For ""honey"": 
      H: absent -> correct for ""BONNY"" because H is not in it.
      O: correct -> matches.
      N: correct -> matches the N at position 3, but not at 4? In ""BONNY"", there is an N at 3 and at 4. We only guessed N at 3, so we get a check for that. The N at 4 in the secret word is not covered by our guess (we guessed Y at 5, not N). So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at position 4 that is N? We have Y at 5, so if the secret word has N at 4, we wouldn't guess it because we have Y at 5. So we don't know.

  But in ""BONNY"", the fourth letter is N. We have not guessed any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any information about position 4 having N? But we already know that the word has N (from the first guess) and we have placed N at 3. If the word has another N? We don't know.

  However, in ""honey"", we only guessed one N (at 3), so if the secret word has two N's, we only get information about one N. So it's possible that the secret word has N at 3 and another N at 4? But we don't know.

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present (minus). In ""inlet"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""nosey"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""honey"", we had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word had two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. Similarly, in other guesses, we only have one N. So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guess a word with one N, we only get one minus. But we don't know if there is a second N. 

  However, in the pattern we have: the word is _ O N E Y. If we try ""BONNY"", then it has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. But we haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't know about N at 4? 

  But in ""honey"", we didn't guess any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, not N. So we don't get information about position 4. 

  However, we can infer: if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then in the feedback for ""honey"", we would have:
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (✓)
      N: correct (✓) -> because N at 3 is correct, and the secret word has N at 3 and also at 4? But we didn't guess the fourth position? 
      But we guessed E at 4, which is correct. So if the secret word has N at 4, then we wouldn't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4, which is correct. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? Because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, which is not N.

  So we don't know about a duplicate N. 

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was minus. If the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten a minus for N (at 4) if the secret word had an N at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and it was minus, meaning that N is in the word but not at 4. If the word had two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know.

  However, in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and it was minus, so if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 2? But we didn't guess it. 

  So we cannot rule out duplicates. 

  But in the current pattern, we have: 
      Position 1: unknown
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: N
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  And we know the word must be a valid English word.

  The candidates we had were ""BONEY"", ""MONEY"", and possibly others? But we ruled out ""NONEY"" because we tested N at 1 and got a minus (so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"" or ""inlet""? Actually, in ""inlet"", N at 2 was minus, so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus in ""inlet"" for N? No, in ""inlet"", N was at 2 and got minus, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. 

  Actually, we never tested N at position 1. So it's possible that N is at 1? But we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if the word had two N's, then N at 1 is not possible, but we can have N at 3 and another N? 

  But in the pattern, we have position 3 as N. If we try ""BONNY"", then the word has N at 3 and at 4. We haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't know.

  However, we can check the feedback for ""honey"": 
      We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). 
      If the secret word were ""BONNY"", then:
          H: absent (correct)
          O: correct
          N: correct (for the N at 3)
          But E: correct (for position 4)
          Y: correct (for position 5)
          And the fourth letter (E) is not N? But we have E at 4 and the secret word has N at 4? Then why didn't we get a minus for the N at 3? Because in ""BONNY"", the N at 3 is correct, so we get a check. But the secret word also has N at 4? We didn't guess a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? But we know from the first guess that N is not at 4 (because ""crane"" had N at 4 and got minus). So if the secret word has N at 4, that would contradict the first guess? Because the first guess said N is not at 4. So the secret word cannot have N at 4. Therefore, ""BONNY"" is impossible because it has N at 4? But wait, ""BONNY"" has N at 3 and 4? So if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then:
        - First guess ""crane"": N at 4 -> minus (correct, because N is at 3 and 4? But we don't know about duplicates? Actually, if the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at 4, we should have gotten a minus (because one N is at 3, so the N at 4 is not at the same position? But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" said N is present but not at 4. If the secret word has two N's, then there is an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know. However, in the first guess, we only got one minus for N, so if there were two N's, we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guess ""crane"", we only mark one N as present? But we don't know which one. 

  Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has two N's, and we guess one N in the wrong position, we get a minus. But we don't know which position is correct for that N? 

  However, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and got a minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. 

  But in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and got a minus, so if there is an N at 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is confusing. 

  Let me reexamine: 

  First guess ""crane"": 
      C: absent -> okay
      R: absent -> okay
      A: absent -> okay
      N: present but not at 4 -> okay (because even if there is an N at 4, we didn't guess it, so we only get a minus for the N we guessed at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we have N at 4 and the feedback says minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions. 

  But if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? We get only that N is present and not at 4. 

  Similarly, in ""inlet"": we had N at 2 and got minus. That means there is an N in the word that is not at 2. It doesn't say anything about position 4? 

  So it is possible that the secret word has an N at 4? But we have to check the feedback for ""crane"": 
      The feedback for ""crane"" says N is present but not at 4. That is, there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. 

  But in ""inlet"", we have N at 2 and got minus, so if there is an N at 4, we don't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is ambiguous. 

  However, we can look at the pattern: the secret word is ? O N E Y. 
      If the first letter is B, then it's ""BONEY"". 
      If the first letter is M, then ""MONEY"".
      If the first letter is N, then ""NONEY"" (but we already ruled out ""NONEY"" because we got a minus for N at 1? But wait, we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if we try ""NONEY"", then we would be putting N at 1? But we know N is not at 1. So we cannot have ""NONEY"".

  Therefore, the first letter cannot be N? Because we already tested N at 1 and got a minus. 

  So the first letter is not N, and not any of the absent letters.

  Now, back to the candidates:
      ""BONEY"": B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.
      ""MONEY"": M at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  And ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  Also, we have other possibilities? 
      ""CONERY"" -> but C is absent.
      ""DONERY"" -> not a word.
      ""PONEY"" -> not common, and we haven't tested P? But we can eliminate.

  So the two main candidates are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We can guess one of them.

  Since we are on the fifth guess, we can try ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we know it's ""MONEY"".

  But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both B and M? But we cannot because we have only one position to fill. We are forced to choose one.

  But note: we don't have to guess a word that is one of the candidates? We could guess a word that includes B and M? But we cannot because we have to have the known letters. 

  We are forced to guess a word that has the pattern: ? O N E Y. 

  The only common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

  We can also consider ""WONEY"" -> not common.

  Or ""JONEY"" -> not common.

  So we choose one.

  I'll go with ""BONEY"" because B is a common letter.

  But we can also consider: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get it right.

  If we guess ""BONEY"" and it's correct, we win.

  If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So let's guess ""BONEY"".

  But note: we have to output the guess.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent.

  Or ""DONERY"" -> not a word.

  So I think it's safe.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""BONEY"".

  But let me confirm the pattern: 
      Position 1: B (or M)
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 3: N (correct)
      Position 4: E (correct)
      Position 5: Y (correct)

  So if we guess ""BONEY"":
      If the secret word is ""BONEY"", we win.
      If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So we do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. 

  What about ""NONEY""? We already ruled out because we know N is not at 1 (from ""nosey"" feedback: N at 1 was minus). So ""NONEY"" is impossible.

  Similarly, ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  So only two candidates: ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We'll guess ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we guess ""MONEY"" next.

  But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 3: `O(✓)` in ""nosey"")
  - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4: `N(✓)` in ""honey"")
  - Position 4: **E** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"" and confirmed in ""honey"")
  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 3: `Y(✓)` in ""nosey"" and ""honey"")

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (marked `x` in previous feedback).

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O N E Y`.

- **First letter constraints**: 
  - Must be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
  - Must form a real word with ""ONERY"".
  - Cannot be **N** (ruled out by Guess 3: `N(-)` in ""nosey"") or **O, E, Y** (which are already placed).

- **Candidates**: 
  - **BONEY** (B at position 1)
  - **MONEY** (M at position 1)

Given that ""HONEY"" was guessed and ruled out (H absent), and ""NONEY"" is invalid (N cannot be at position 1), the only remaining common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

""BONEY"" is chosen to test **B** at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate B and guess ""MONEY"" next.

<guess>boney</guess>",boney,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""honey"":
  H: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  N: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

This tells us:
- H is absent (so the first letter is not H)
- O, N, E, Y are all correct in their positions: positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed as O, N, E, Y.

Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (from previous feedback)
- Forms a valid English word with ""ONERY""

From previous guesses, we have ruled out:
- C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H as possible first letters.

The only common words left are:
- BONEY: B at position 1
- MONEY: M at position 1

We also had ""NONEY"" (not a word) and ""BONNY"" (but that would be B-O-N-N-Y, which has two N's, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates. Also, ""BONNY"" has N at position 3 and 4? But we already have N at position 3, and if we put N at 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two minuses? But we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only got one minus. Similarly in other guesses. So it's likely no duplicates. Therefore, we assume the first letter is not N (because if it were, we would have seen duplicates in the feedback? Not necessarily: because we never put N at position 1 in a guess? Actually, in ""nosey"", we put N at 1 and got a minus, so N is not at 1. But we don't know about duplicates: if the word had two N's, we might have gotten a minus for N at 1 even if another N is at 3? But in ""nosey"", we have only one N (at position 1) and it was marked as minus, meaning there is an N but not at 1. It doesn't say anything about a duplicate N at 3. However, in ""honey"", we have N at 3 and it was correct, so if there were a duplicate N at 1, we wouldn't know because we never tested N at 1 in a way that would show a duplicate? 

But let's think: if the word were ""NONEY"", then in ""honey"" we have:
  H (absent) -> correct because ""NONEY"" has no H.
  O, N, E, Y: correct.

But in ""NONEY"", the first letter is N. We never tested N at position 1? But in ""nosey"", we tested N at 1 and got a minus, meaning that N is not at 1. But if the word is ""NONEY"", then N is at 1. So that would contradict the feedback of ""nosey"": because we got a minus for N at 1, meaning that N is not at 1. Therefore, ""NONEY"" is impossible.

Similarly, we have to check if there is a word ""BONNY"": 
  B-O-N-N-Y -> but then the first letter is B, and the third letter is N. But in ""honey"", we have N at position 3 and it was correct. If the word is ""BONNY"", then in ""honey"":
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (position 2)
      N: correct (position 3) -> but ""BONNY"" has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. We guessed N at 3 and it was correct. But what about the N at 4? We didn't guess it. So we don't know. 
      However, in ""honey"", we only have one N (at 3), so we get a check for N. But if the word is ""BONNY"", then the fourth letter is N, which we didn't guess. So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at 4 that is N in ""honey"". 

  But the feedback for ""honey"" only tells us about the letters we guessed. For ""honey"": 
      H: absent -> correct for ""BONNY"" because H is not in it.
      O: correct -> matches.
      N: correct -> matches the N at position 3, but not at 4? In ""BONNY"", there is an N at 3 and at 4. We only guessed N at 3, so we get a check for that. The N at 4 in the secret word is not covered by our guess (we guessed Y at 5, not N). So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at position 4 that is N? We have Y at 5, so if the secret word has N at 4, we wouldn't guess it because we have Y at 5. So we don't know.

  But in ""BONNY"", the fourth letter is N. We have not guessed any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any information about position 4 having N? But we already know that the word has N (from the first guess) and we have placed N at 3. If the word has another N? We don't know.

  However, in ""honey"", we only guessed one N (at 3), so if the secret word has two N's, we only get information about one N. So it's possible that the secret word has N at 3 and another N at 4? But we don't know.

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present (minus). In ""inlet"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""nosey"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""honey"", we had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word had two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. Similarly, in other guesses, we only have one N. So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guess a word with one N, we only get one minus. But we don't know if there is a second N. 

  However, in the pattern we have: the word is _ O N E Y. If we try ""BONNY"", then it has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. But we haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't know about N at 4? 

  But in ""honey"", we didn't guess any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, not N. So we don't get information about position 4. 

  However, we can infer: if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then in the feedback for ""honey"", we would have:
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (✓)
      N: correct (✓) -> because N at 3 is correct, and the secret word has N at 3 and also at 4? But we didn't guess the fourth position? 
      But we guessed E at 4, which is correct. So if the secret word has N at 4, then we wouldn't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4, which is correct. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? Because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, which is not N.

  So we don't know about a duplicate N. 

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was minus. If the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten a minus for N (at 4) if the secret word had an N at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and it was minus, meaning that N is in the word but not at 4. If the word had two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know.

  However, in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and it was minus, so if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 2? But we didn't guess it. 

  So we cannot rule out duplicates. 

  But in the current pattern, we have: 
      Position 1: unknown
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: N
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  And we know the word must be a valid English word.

  The candidates we had were ""BONEY"", ""MONEY"", and possibly others? But we ruled out ""NONEY"" because we tested N at 1 and got a minus (so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"" or ""inlet""? Actually, in ""inlet"", N at 2 was minus, so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus in ""inlet"" for N? No, in ""inlet"", N was at 2 and got minus, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. 

  Actually, we never tested N at position 1. So it's possible that N is at 1? But we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if the word had two N's, then N at 1 is not possible, but we can have N at 3 and another N? 

  But in the pattern, we have position 3 as N. If we try ""BONNY"", then the word has N at 3 and at 4. We haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't know.

  However, we can check the feedback for ""honey"": 
      We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). 
      If the secret word were ""BONNY"", then:
          H: absent (correct)
          O: correct
          N: correct (for the N at 3)
          But E: correct (for position 4)
          Y: correct (for position 5)
          And the fourth letter (E) is not N? But we have E at 4 and the secret word has N at 4? Then why didn't we get a minus for the N at 3? Because in ""BONNY"", the N at 3 is correct, so we get a check. But the secret word also has N at 4? We didn't guess a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? But we know from the first guess that N is not at 4 (because ""crane"" had N at 4 and got minus). So if the secret word has N at 4, that would contradict the first guess? Because the first guess said N is not at 4. So the secret word cannot have N at 4. Therefore, ""BONNY"" is impossible because it has N at 4? But wait, ""BONNY"" has N at 3 and 4? So if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then:
        - First guess ""crane"": N at 4 -> minus (correct, because N is at 3 and 4? But we don't know about duplicates? Actually, if the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at 4, we should have gotten a minus (because one N is at 3, so the N at 4 is not at the same position? But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" said N is present but not at 4. If the secret word has two N's, then there is an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know.

  But in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and got a minus, so if there is an N at 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is confusing. 

  Let me reexamine: 

  First guess ""crane"": 
      C: absent -> okay
      R: absent -> okay
      A: absent -> okay
      N: present but not at 4 -> okay (because even if there is an N at 4, we didn't guess it, so we only get a minus for the N we guessed at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we have N at 4 and the feedback says minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions. 

  But if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? We get only that N is present and not at 4. 

  Similarly, in ""inlet"": we had N at 2 and got minus. That means there is an N in the word that is not at 2. It doesn't say anything about position 4? 

  So it is possible that the secret word has an N at 4? But we have to check the feedback for ""crane"": 
      The feedback for ""crane"" says N is present but not at 4. That is, there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. 

  But in ""inlet"", we have N at 2 and got minus, so if there is an N at 4, we don't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is ambiguous. 

  However, we can look at the pattern: the secret word is ? O N E Y. 
      If the first letter is B, then it's ""BONEY"". 
      If the first letter is M, then ""MONEY"".
      If the first letter is N, then ""NONEY"" (but we already ruled out ""NONEY"" because we got a minus for N at 1? But wait, we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if we try ""NONEY"", then we would be putting N at 1? But we know N is not at 1. So we cannot have ""NONEY"".

  Therefore, the first letter cannot be N? Because we already tested N at 1 and got a minus. 

  So the first letter is not N, and not any of the absent letters.

  Now, back to the candidates:
      ""BONEY"": B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.
      ""MONEY"": M at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  And ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  Also, we have other possibilities? 
      ""CONERY"" -> but C is absent.
      ""DONERY"" -> not a word.
      ""PONEY"" -> not common, and we haven't tested P? But we can eliminate.

  So the two main candidates are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We can guess one of them.

  Since we are on the fifth guess, we can try ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we know it's ""MONEY"".

  But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both B and M? But we cannot because we have only one position to fill. We are forced to choose one.

  The only common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

  We can also consider ""WONEY"" -> not common.

  Or ""JONEY"" -> not common.

  So we choose one.

  I'll go with ""BONEY"" because B is a common letter.

  But we can also consider: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get it right.

  If we guess ""BONEY"" and it's correct, we win.

  If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So let's guess ""BONEY"".

  But note: we have to output the guess.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent.

  Or ""DONERY"" -> not a word.

  So I think it's safe.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""BONEY"".

  But let me confirm the pattern: 
      Position 1: B (or M)
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 3: N (correct)
      Position 4: E (correct)
      Position 5: Y (correct)

  So if we guess ""BONEY"":
      If the secret word is ""BONEY"", we win.
      If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So we do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. 

  What about ""NONEY""? We already ruled out because we know N is not at 1 (from ""nosey"" feedback: N at 1 was minus). So ""NONEY"" is impossible.

  Similarly, ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  So only two candidates: ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We'll guess ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we guess ""MONEY"" next.

  But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

  Format: <guess>boney</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 3: `O(✓)` in ""nosey"")
  - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4: `N(✓)` in ""honey"")
  - Position 4: **E** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"" and confirmed in ""honey"")
  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 3: `Y(✓)` in ""nosey"" and ""honey"")

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (marked `x` in previous feedback).

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O N E Y`.

- **First letter constraints**: 
  - Must be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
  - Must form a real word with ""ONERY"".
  - Cannot be **N** (ruled out by Guess 3: `N(-)` in ""nosey"") or **O, E, Y** (which are already placed).

- **Candidates**: 
  - **BONEY** (B at position 1)
  - **MONEY** (M at position 1)

Given that ""HONEY"" was guessed and ruled out (H absent), and ""NONEY"" is invalid (N cannot be at position 1), the only remaining common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

""BONEY"" is chosen to test **B** at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate B and guess ""MONEY"" next.",Guess 5: boney -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x).
 - N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters N and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, N was in the 4th position and E in the 5th position of ""crane"", so in the secret word:
     N is not at position 4.
     E is not at position 5.

 - The secret word does not contain C, R, or A.

 We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long and must be a valid English word.

 Since N and E are present, we should try to use a word that includes N and E, but in different positions.

 We must avoid using C, R, A.

 Let's think of a word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A.
   - Contains N and E (but not at position 4 for N and not at position 5 for E).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

 Let's try to put N and E in positions that are not 4 and 5 respectively.

 Possibilities for N: it can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5? But note: we don't know the exact positions, but we know it's not at 4.

 Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.

 Let's try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.

 Example words: 
   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That's position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.

 But in ""LINED"": 
   L, I, N, E, D.
   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).

 However, we don't know if the word has L, I, D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that's not a common word? And it has two E's? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Let's think of more common words.

 Another idea: ""STONE"" -> 
   S, T, O, N, E.
   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.

 In ""STONE"":
   N is at position 4 -> we know that's not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.

 How about ""STEIN"":
   S, T, E, I, N.
   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).

 But note: we don't know if the word has S, T, I.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": 
   I, N, L, E, T.
   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). 

 This seems good.

 But let's check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> 
   S, P, I, N, E.
   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.

 How about ""NEEDS"": 
   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don't know.

 To keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""UNITE"" -> 
   U, N, I, T, E.
   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.

 So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""UNTIE"": 
   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""INTEG""? But that's not a common word.

 Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> 
   S, I, N, E, W.
   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But we have W, which is less common.

 How about ""MINES"": 
   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That's allowed. But note: we have two E's? We don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn't have them.

 But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E's, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E's, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, let's try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.

 Let me list some words that fit:
   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5
   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

 We can try:
   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. 
   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). 
   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don't know about them.

 How about ""NOISE"": 
   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""NOBLE"": 
   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.

 How about ""NEXUS"": 
   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.

 But we don't know about X and U.

 Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": 
   L, I, N, E, S -> 
      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). 

 But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: 
   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).

 So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). 

 Also, we avoid C, R, A.

 So ""LINES"" is a candidate.

 But wait: we have S at the end. We don't know about S.

 Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> 
   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.

 However, ""MINES"" has two E's? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.

 But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". 

 We can also consider ""DINER"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.

 How about ""DINES"": 
   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.

 But we don't know about D.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.

 We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let's choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". 

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

 But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don't know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven't tried and also includes other common letters.

 Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> 
   S, L, E, P, T.
   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don't have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don't have to, but if we don't include N, we won't get information about N's position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.

 Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.

 So let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: we have to make sure we don't put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":
   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). 

 So that's acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can't because E is at 5. 

 Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.

 How about ""BONES"": 
   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 But we don't know about B, O, S.

 I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.

 However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.

 Let's go with ""LINES"".

 But wait: what about the letter S? We don't know about S. We can try it.

 Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that's not a word. 

 Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. 

 How about ""INLET"": 
   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). 
   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). 

 This is also a candidate.

 We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". 

 We can choose either. Let's pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.

 But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.

 However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.

 I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 But let me check: 
   In ""INLET"": 
      Position 1: I -> we don't know.
      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don't know if it's at 2.
      Position 3: L -> unknown.
      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.
      Position 5: T -> unknown.

 This will help us:

   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it's present but not at 2, we get a minus.

   Similarly for E at 4.

 Also, we get information about I, L, T.

 Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.

 I think both are reasonable. Let's choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.

 So I'll go with ""INLET"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.

 Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it's not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).

 So let's choose ""INLET"".

 However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""INLET"": 
   N is at position 2 (we haven't tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven't tried position 4 for E).

 So that's good.

 Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".

 But let me double-check: 
   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)
   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)

   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)

   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.

 So I think that's a good guess.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.

 Another word: ""WINDS"" -> 
   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). 
   N at 3 (allowed) and we don't have E? But we must include E because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip E.

 We must include both N and E.

 So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.

 Let's go with ""INLET"".

<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).
- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).

For the next guess:
- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.
- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.

The word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:
- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).
- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).
- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>inlet</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)
  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]
  L: x (not in word)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (not in word)

So, from all feedback so far:

Absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T
Present letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)

We also know about N:
  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.
  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.

Therefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.

We know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).

The secret word has 5 letters. We know:
  Position 4: E

And N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
  - Has E at position 4.
  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).
  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Available common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.

Case 1: N at position 1
  Then the word: N _ _ E _
  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.

Case 2: N at position 3
  Then: _ _ N E _
  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _
  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)

Actually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it's not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.

But note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don't know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn't show duplicates, so we can't be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.

But in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it's likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.

So the word has exactly one N and one E.

Therefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).

Let's try to form words:

Case 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _
  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.

  Possible words: 
    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.

  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.

  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E's? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let's spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.

  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.

  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?

  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).

  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N's? We don't want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't seen any. So avoid.

  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.

  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.

  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.

  ""NOVEL"": 
    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": 
      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.

  ""NOSEY"": 
    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    But we don't know about O, S, Y.

  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let's see.

  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? 
      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). 
    But X is uncommon.

  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.

  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.

Case 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _
  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.

  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? 
      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
    This word: 
      - Has E at 4 (good).
      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).
      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.

  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.

  ""BONES"" is a valid word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  Then we need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.

  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.

  ""SHOWN"": 
      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.

  ""POWER"": 
      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.

  ""DOWNS"": 
      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.

  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that's not a word? 
      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? 
      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E's? We don't want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: 
        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.

  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? 
      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that's not a single word? 
      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? 
      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? 
      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, in ""SENSE"": 
        Position 4 is C? Not E. 
        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? 
        That would be ... E N. 
        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that's not E at 4 and N at 5. 

  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that's 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N's? We don't want duplicates.

  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.

Case 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _
  Then we need positions 2,3,5.

  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. 
  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's? 
  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This fits: 
        - E is at 4 (good).
        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). 
        - Uses U, K, S which are available.

  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it's accepted in word games sometimes? But let's see if there's a better one.

  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S's? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S's? We don't know if the secret word has two S's. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.

  But ""NOSES"" has two S's. We might get less information.

  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.

  ""NURDS"" -> not common.

  ""NEXUS"": 
      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.

  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?

  So the third letter must be something else. 

  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.

  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N's.

  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let's see if there's a better word.

Case 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N
  We need positions 1,2,3.

  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.
  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.

  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. 
      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". 
      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? 
      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.

  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N's.

  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.

  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.

  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. 
      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Examples: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.
        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.

  How about ""SENTE""? It's a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.

  I think it's hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. 

  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. 

  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. 
      But then the fourth is E. 
      So the word ends with ""EN"". 

      Words: 
        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? 
        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.
        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.

  Actually, I can't think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". 

  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.

Therefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.

So pattern: _ _ N E _

We need to fill positions 1,2,5.

We have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Candidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.

Also, we are testing B, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.

""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.

""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 

But we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.

Another candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E's? We don't want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don't know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E's? Not good.

""HONES"" -> not a word.

""bones"" seems a good candidate.

But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

Another candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.

""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.

""bones"" is good.

But let me see if there are other words.

""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? 
  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is also a candidate.

We have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".

We can choose either. Let's pick ""bones"" because it's more common.

But note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.

Another word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. 
  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  But we don't know about D and U.

  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.

  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".

  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.

  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.

  Let's choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.

  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.

  We want to maximize information. 

  In ""dunes"": 
    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""bones"": 
    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  In ""zones"": 
    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We don't know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.

  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.

  Another word: ""bones"" is good.

  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. 

  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.

  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This fits the pattern? 
        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). 
        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.

  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: 
      Position 1: N
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: S
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.

  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.

  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.

  But we are also testing S and Y.

  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.

  We don't know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.

  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". 

  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven't tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven't tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.

  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.

  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.

  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word.

  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? 

  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.

  So we have:
    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S
    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y
    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y

  We can choose one that uses more common letters.

  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.

  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. 

  We are testing B, O, S.

  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  So let's go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.

  But we are not there yet.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters.

  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). 
      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.

  But ""dunes"" is a common word.

  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.

  But I think ""bones"" is more common.

  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  I think either is fine. Let's choose ""bones"".

  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven't tested O before.

  We are going to test O at position 2.

  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.

  Similarly for B and S.

  This will give us good information.

  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".

  But let me confirm: 
    Guess 3: ""bones""

  Pattern: B O N E S

  We know:
    Position 4: E (will be ✓)
    Position 3: N (we are testing if it's at 3)

  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.

  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.

  But we don't have a good word for case 1 and case 3.

  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven't tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it's new.

  So I'll go with ""bones"".

  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.

  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N's and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.

  I think we should go with ""bones"".

  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? 
    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). 
    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven't tested. And we test O, S, Y.

  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  And it's a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.

  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.

  Let's choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.

  But we already know E is at 4, so we don't need to test E again? But we are including it.

  Actually, we are testing the entire word.

  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.

  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.

  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.

  So let's do that.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find a common word without the absent letters. 

  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. 

  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.

  Words: 
    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.
    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.
    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.

  I think it's safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. 

  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.

  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.

  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".

  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.

  So let's do that.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.

  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). 

  Then we can adjust.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  But let me see: 
    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:
      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.
      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.
      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.

  Similarly for O, S, Y.

  So we get information.

  Therefore, I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  Both are good. I'll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven't tried.

  So guess: ""nosey""

  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. 

  We haven't tried H.

  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". 

  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".

  We can choose one.

  I think I'll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.

  So let's do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn't find one. 

  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.

  ""MONEY"" doesn't have N at 5.

  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.

  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".

  Let's choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:
      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.

  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  But we have more guesses.

  So it's acceptable.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see the feedback we might get:

  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:
      For ""nosey"": 
        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓
        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? 
        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don't know.
        E: ✓ (at 4)
        Y: ? 

  But we don't know the secret word.

  We are trying to get the word.

  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.

  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.

  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.

  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.

  So I'll go with ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don't know.

  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.

  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.

  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.

  We haven't tried position 1 for N? We haven't tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don't know about other letters at position 1.

  So testing position 1 with N is good.

  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".

  But let me see: 
    ""nosey"": 
      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.
      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? 
      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?
      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)
      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?

  This will give us good information.

  So I'll go with that.

  Final decision: ""nosey""

  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:
      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.
      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.

  So it's a good test.

  Therefore, I'll guess ""nosey"".

  But note: we have to output in the format.

  So the guess is ""nosey"".

  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.

  So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").
- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).

The secret word must:
- Have **E at position 4**.
- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).
- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.

For the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:
- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).
- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).
- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).
- Avoid absent letters.

This guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.

<guess>nosey</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: x (absent)
  A: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 4)
  E: - (present, but not at position 5)

Guess 2: ""inlet""
  I: x (absent)
  N: - (present, but not at position 2)
  L: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  T: x (absent)

Guess 3: ""nosey""
  N: - (present, but not at position 1)
  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)
  S: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Correct positions:
   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")
   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))

2. So the secret word has: _ O _ E Y

3. Known absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (from ""nosey"": S(x))

4. Known present letters: N (but not at position 1,2,4? 
   - Not at 1 (from ""nosey"": N(-))
   - Not at 2 (from ""inlet"": N(-))
   - Not at 4 (from ""crane"": N(-) and ""inlet"": N(-) which confirms position 4 is E)
   - Not at 5? We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don't have direct feedback on N at 3? 
     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.
     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.
     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.
     - Therefore, N must be at position 3? Because positions 1,2,4,5 are all ruled out? 
        - Position 1: ruled out by ""nosey""
        - Position 2: ruled out by ""inlet""
        - Position 4: ruled out by ""crane"" and ""inlet"" (which has E at 4)
        - Position 5: ruled out by ""nosey"" (Y is at 5)
        - Therefore, only position 3 is left for N.

   So N must be at position 3.

5. Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

6. We only need to find the first letter.

7. The first letter must be a letter that:
   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.
   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".

8. Possible words: 
   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don't know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let's see: 
        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O's, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O's, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don't have another O in the guess. So we don't know.

   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. 

   So likely, the first letter is not O. 

   We need a word: [letter] ONERY

   Common words: 
     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. 
        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven't tested B. And it's not in the absent list.

     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.

     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let's check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.

     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.

     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.

     ""PONEY"" -> not common.

     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.

     ""WONEY"" -> not common.

     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.

   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. 
        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.
        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.
        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.

   But we don't know which one. We need to test the first letter.

   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.

   But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one of these.

   How to choose? We can pick one that uses a common letter? Or we can pick one that might be the word.

   We don't have any information about the first letter. We have to guess.

   But we can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in previous guesses. So we don't know about them.

   We can choose ""HONEY"" because H is a common letter? Or ""MONEY"" because M is common? 

   Alternatively, we can think: we have to fill the first position. We can try ""HONEY"".

   But note: if we guess ""HONEY"", and it's not the word, we get feedback and then we can try another.

   However, we have three candidates: ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"". 

   But wait: are there more? 
      ""PONEY"" -> not common.
      ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.
      ""WONEY"" -> not common.

   So likely, it's one of these three.

   We can also consider: we have not tested B, H, M in any guess? So we don't have information. 

   But we can choose ""HONEY"" because it's a common word.

   However, we must be cautious: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Or ""DONERY""? Not a word.

   So the candidates are: BONEY, HONEY, MONEY.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" and if it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one of those.

   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.

   So we can guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me see: 
        If we guess ""HONEY"":
          If it's correct, we win.
          If not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes B, H, M? But we only have one position to fill. We are forced to guess one of these.

   But note: we don't know if the word has H, B, or M. We haven't tested any of them.

   So we have to choose one.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good guess because H is a common letter.

   But we can also consider: we have already used O, N, E, Y in the current guess? We are going to use them again? Actually, we have to: because the word is almost known.

   The secret word pattern: ? O N E Y

   We don't know the first letter, so we have to guess one of the candidates.

   We can choose ""HONEY"".

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get feedback that H is absent? And we know it's B.

   Similarly, if we guess ""HONEY"" and the feedback shows:
        H: if absent, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

   However, we can also consider: we have not tested the letter B, H, M in any context. So we don't have information. 

   But we can try to use a word that has multiple candidates? But we can't because we only have one position.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of the candidates but that tests the first letter with B, H, M? But we cannot because we must have the pattern: ? O N E Y. 

   Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.

   I think ""HONEY"" is a good choice.

   So let's go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not sure if the word is ""HONEY"". We are just guessing.

   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".

   We'll guess ""HONEY"".

   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":

        H: absent -> x
        O: correct -> ✓
        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")
        E: correct -> ✓
        Y: correct -> ✓

        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)

        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.

   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".

   But we have two more guesses, so it's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate but that tests the first letter? But we cannot because we must have the known letters.

   Therefore, we guess ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are not forced to use the known letters? We could use a different word? But then we would be wasting the known letters? Because we know they are in the word and in those positions.

   We should use the known letters to get the word.

   So I think ""HONEY"" is the best guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY""? Then we guess one.

   We can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in any guess. So we don't have information. 

   But we don't need to test the letters in the other positions? Because we are only missing the first letter.

   So I think we should guess one of the candidates.

   I'll choose ""HONEY"".

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two more after this.

   So let's do that.

   However, we must output the guess.

   But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.

   Another possibility: ""DONERY"" is not a word.

   So I think it's safe.

   Therefore, the next guess is ""HONEY"".

   But let me see the pattern: 
        Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,I,L,T,S} and must form a word)
        Position 2: O (fixed)
        Position 3: N (fixed)
        Position 4: E (fixed)
        Position 5: Y (fixed)

   So the word must be ?ONERY.

   We have three possibilities: B, H, M.

   We can guess ""HONEY"" to test H.

   If it's not, then we know it's either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we guess one.

   But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

   So I'll go with ""HONEY"".

   But note: we have to output the guess.

   So the guess is ""HONEY"".

   Format: <guess>honey</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E is confirmed at position 4** and **Y at position 5** (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **O is confirmed at position 2** (from Guess 3).
- **N is present** but ruled out of positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (from Guesses 1-3). The only remaining position is 3, so **N must be at position 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (marked `x`).
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O N E Y`

The first letter must:
- Be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
- Form a 5-letter word with ""ONERY"".
- Not be C, R, A, I, L, T, S.

Possible candidates: **BONEY**, **HONEY**, **MONEY**.

""HONEY"" is chosen to test **H** (a common letter) at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate H and try another candidate.

<guess>honey</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 4: honey -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""honey"":
  H: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  N: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

This tells us:
- H is absent (so the first letter is not H)
- O, N, E, Y are all correct in their positions: positions 2,3,4,5 are fixed as O, N, E, Y.

Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (from previous feedback)
- Forms a valid English word with ""ONERY""

From previous guesses, we have ruled out:
- C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H as possible first letters.

The only common words left are:
- BONEY: B at position 1
- MONEY: M at position 1

We also had ""NONEY"" (not a word) and ""BONNY"" (but that would be B-O-N-N-Y, which has two N's, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates. Also, ""BONNY"" has N at position 3 and 4? But we already have N at position 3, and if we put N at 4, that would be a duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present, so if there were two N's, we might have gotten two minuses? But we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only got one minus. Similarly in other guesses. So it's likely no duplicates. Therefore, we assume the first letter is not N (because if it were, we would have seen duplicates in the feedback? Not necessarily: because we never put N at position 1 in a guess? Actually, in ""nosey"", we put N at 1 and got a minus, so N is not at 1. But we don't know about duplicates: if the word had two N's, we might have gotten a minus for N at 1 even if another N is at 3? But in ""nosey"", we have only one N (at position 1) and it was marked as minus, meaning there is an N but not at 1. It doesn't say anything about a duplicate N at 3. However, in ""honey"", we have N at 3 and it was correct, so if there were a duplicate N at 1, we wouldn't know because we never tested N at 1 in a way that would show a duplicate? 

But let's think: if the word were ""NONEY"", then in ""honey"" we have:
  H (absent) -> correct because ""NONEY"" has no H.
  O, N, E, Y: correct.

But in ""NONEY"", the first letter is N. We never tested N at position 1? But in ""nosey"", we tested N at 1 and got a minus, meaning that N is not at 1. But if the word is ""NONEY"", then N is at 1. So that would contradict the feedback of ""nosey"": because we got a minus for N at 1, meaning that N is not at 1. Therefore, ""NONEY"" is impossible.

Similarly, we have to check if there is a word ""BONNY"": 
  B-O-N-N-Y -> but then the first letter is B, and the third letter is N. But in ""honey"", we have N at position 3 and it was correct. If the word is ""BONNY"", then in ""honey"":
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (position 2)
      N: correct (position 3) -> but ""BONNY"" has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. We guessed N at 3 and it was correct. But what about the N at 4? We didn't guess it. So we don't know. 
      However, in ""honey"", we only have one N (at 3), so we get a check for N. But if the word is ""BONNY"", then the fourth letter is N, which we didn't guess. So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at 4 that is N in ""honey"". 

  But the feedback for ""honey"" only tells us about the letters we guessed. For ""honey"": 
      H: absent -> correct for ""BONNY"" because H is not in it.
      O: correct -> matches.
      N: correct -> matches the N at position 3, but not at 4? In ""BONNY"", there is an N at 3 and at 4. We only guessed N at 3, so we get a check for that. The N at 4 in the secret word is not covered by our guess (we guessed Y at 5, not N). So we don't get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don't have a letter at position 4 that is N? We have Y at 5, so if the secret word has N at 4, we wouldn't guess it because we have Y at 5. So we don't know.

  But in ""BONNY"", the fourth letter is N. We have not guessed any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any information about position 4 having N? But we already know that the word has N (from the first guess) and we have placed N at 3. If the word has another N? We don't know.

  However, in ""honey"", we only guessed one N (at 3), so if the secret word has two N's, we only get information about one N. So it's possible that the secret word has N at 3 and another N at 4? But we don't know.

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present (minus). In ""inlet"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""nosey"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""honey"", we had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word had two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. Similarly, in other guesses, we only have one N. So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guess a word with one N, we only get one minus. But we don't know if there is a second N. 

  However, in the pattern we have: the word is _ O N E Y. If we try ""BONNY"", then it has two N's: one at 3 and one at 4. But we haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't know about N at 4? 

  But in ""honey"", we didn't guess any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, not N. So we don't get information about position 4. 

  However, we can infer: if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then in the feedback for ""honey"", we would have:
      H: absent (correct)
      O: correct (✓)
      N: correct (✓) -> because N at 3 is correct, and the secret word has N at 3 and also at 4? But we didn't guess the fourth position? 
      But we guessed E at 4, which is correct. So if the secret word has N at 4, then we wouldn't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4, which is correct. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? Because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, which is not N.

  So we don't know about a duplicate N. 

  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was minus. If the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten a minus for N (at 4) if the secret word had an N at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and it was minus, meaning that N is in the word but not at 4. If the word had two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know.

  However, in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and it was minus, so if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 2? But we didn't guess it. 

  So we cannot rule out duplicates. 

  But in the current pattern, we have: 
      Position 1: unknown
      Position 2: O
      Position 3: N
      Position 4: E
      Position 5: Y

  And we know the word must be a valid English word.

  The candidates we had were ""BONEY"", ""MONEY"", and possibly others? But we ruled out ""NONEY"" because we tested N at 1 and got a minus (so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"" or ""inlet""? Actually, in ""inlet"", N at 2 was minus, so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus in ""inlet"" for N? No, in ""inlet"", N was at 2 and got minus, but that doesn't say anything about position 1. 

  Actually, we never tested N at position 1. So it's possible that N is at 1? But we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if the word had two N's, then N at 1 is not possible, but we can have N at 3 and another N? 

  But in the pattern, we have position 3 as N. If we try ""BONNY"", then the word has N at 3 and at 4. We haven't guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't know.

  However, we can check the feedback for ""honey"": 
      We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). 
      If the secret word were ""BONNY"", then:
          H: absent (correct)
          O: correct
          N: correct (for the N at 3)
          But E: correct (for position 4)
          Y: correct (for position 5)
          And the fourth letter (E) is not N? But we have E at 4 and the secret word has N at 4? Then why didn't we get a minus for the N at 3? Because in ""BONNY"", the N at 3 is correct, so we get a check. But the secret word also has N at 4? We didn't guess a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don't have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? But we know from the first guess that N is not at 4 (because ""crane"" had N at 4 and got minus). So if the secret word has N at 4, that would contradict the first guess? Because the first guess said N is not at 4. So the secret word cannot have N at 4. Therefore, ""BONNY"" is impossible because it has N at 4? But wait, ""BONNY"" has N at 3 and 4? So if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then:
        - First guess ""crane"": N at 4 -> minus (correct, because N is at 3 and 4? But we don't know about duplicates? Actually, if the secret word has two N's, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at 4, we should have gotten a minus (because one N is at 3, so the N at 4 is not at the same position? But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" said N is present but not at 4. If the secret word has two N's, then there is an N at 4? But we didn't guess it, so we don't know. However, in the first guess, we only got one minus for N, so if there were two N's, we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. So if the secret word has two N's, then when we guess ""crane"", we only mark one N as present? But we don't know which one. 

  Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has two N's, and we guess one N in the wrong position, we get a minus. But we don't know which position is correct for that N? 

  However, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and got a minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. 

  But in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and got a minus, so if there is an N at 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is confusing. 

  Let me reexamine: 

  First guess ""crane"": 
      C: absent -> okay
      R: absent -> okay
      A: absent -> okay
      N: present but not at 4 -> okay (because even if there is an N at 4, we didn't guess it, so we only get a minus for the N we guessed at 4? But we didn't guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we have N at 4 and the feedback says minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't tell us about other positions. 

  But if the secret word has two N's, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don't get any indication that there is an N at 4? We get only that N is present and not at 4. 

  Similarly, in ""inlet"": we had N at 2 and got minus. That means there is an N in the word that is not at 2. It doesn't say anything about position 4? 

  So it is possible that the secret word has an N at 4? But we have to check the feedback for ""crane"": 
      The feedback for ""crane"" says N is present but not at 4. That is, there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. 

  But in ""inlet"", we have N at 2 and got minus, so if there is an N at 4, we don't know because we didn't guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? 

  This is ambiguous. 

  However, we can look at the pattern: the secret word is ? O N E Y. 
      If the first letter is B, then it's ""BONEY"". 
      If the first letter is M, then ""MONEY"".
      If the first letter is N, then ""NONEY"" (but we already ruled out ""NONEY"" because we got a minus for N at 1? But wait, we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if we try ""NONEY"", then we would be putting N at 1? But we know N is not at 1. So we cannot have ""NONEY"".

  Therefore, the first letter cannot be N? Because we already tested N at 1 and got a minus. 

  So the first letter is not N, and not any of the absent letters.

  Now, back to the candidates:
      ""BONEY"": B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.
      ""MONEY"": M at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.

  And ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  Also, we have other possibilities? 
      ""CONERY"" -> but C is absent.
      ""DONERY"" -> not a word.
      ""PONEY"" -> not common, and we haven't tested P? But we can eliminate.

  So the two main candidates are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We can guess one of them.

  Since we are on the fifth guess, we can try ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we know it's ""MONEY"".

  But we have two more guesses, so it's safe.

  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both B and M? But we cannot because we have only one position to fill. We are forced to choose one.

  But note: we don't have to guess a word that is one of the candidates? We could guess a word that includes B and M? But we cannot because we have to have the known letters. 

  We are forced to guess a word that has the pattern: ? O N E Y. 

  The only common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

  We can also consider ""WONEY"" -> not common.

  Or ""JONEY"" -> not common.

  So we choose one.

  I'll go with ""BONEY"" because B is a common letter.

  But we can also consider: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get it right.

  If we guess ""BONEY"" and it's correct, we win.

  If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So let's guess ""BONEY"".

  But note: we have to output the guess.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

  But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent.

  Or ""DONERY"" -> not a word.

  So I think it's safe.

  Therefore, the next guess is ""BONEY"".

  But let me confirm the pattern: 
      Position 1: B (or M)
      Position 2: O (correct)
      Position 3: N (correct)
      Position 4: E (correct)
      Position 5: Y (correct)

  So if we guess ""BONEY"":
      If the secret word is ""BONEY"", we win.
      If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".

  So we do that.

  But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. 

  What about ""NONEY""? We already ruled out because we know N is not at 1 (from ""nosey"" feedback: N at 1 was minus). So ""NONEY"" is impossible.

  Similarly, ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.

  So only two candidates: ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".

  We'll guess ""BONEY"".

  If it's not, then we guess ""MONEY"" next.

  But we have two more guesses, so it's okay.

  So the guess is ""BONEY"".

  Format: <guess>boney</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Fixed positions**:
  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 3: `O(✓)` in ""nosey"")
  - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4: `N(✓)` in ""honey"")
  - Position 4: **E** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"" and confirmed in ""honey"")
  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 3: `Y(✓)` in ""nosey"" and ""honey"")

- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (marked `x` in previous feedback).

- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O N E Y`.

- **First letter constraints**: 
  - Must be a valid English letter not in the absent list.
  - Must form a real word with ""ONERY"".
  - Cannot be **N** (ruled out by Guess 3: `N(-)` in ""nosey"") or **O, E, Y** (which are already placed).

- **Candidates**: 
  - **BONEY** (B at position 1)
  - **MONEY** (M at position 1)

Given that ""HONEY"" was guessed and ruled out (H absent), and ""NONEY"" is invalid (N cannot be at position 1), the only remaining common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". 

""BONEY"" is chosen to test **B** at position 1. If correct, we solve the word. If not, we eliminate B and guess ""MONEY"" next.

But note: we don\'t know the exact positions, but we know it\'s not at 4.\n\n Similarly, E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n However, we must also avoid the letters C, R, A.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has N and E, and three new letters.\n\n Example words: \n   ""LINED"" -> but note: we have E at the end? That\'s position 5, which we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is in the word but not at position 5, so we cannot put E at 5. Similarly, N cannot be at 4.\n\n But in ""LINED"": \n   L, I, N, E, D.\n   N is at position 3 (which is allowed) and E is at position 4 (which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5).\n\n However, we don\'t know if the word has L, I, D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SENTE"" but that\'s not a common word? And it has two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters.\n\n Let\'s think of more common words.\n\n Another idea: ""STONE"" -> \n   S, T, O, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? But wait, in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put N at position 4 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not at 4 so it would be a waste. We should try N in a new position.\n\n In ""STONE"":\n   N is at position 4 -> we know that\'s not the position for N (from first feedback), so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""STEIN"":\n   S, T, E, I, N.\n   E is at position 3 (not 5) and N is at position 5 (which is not 4, so allowed).\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has S, T, I.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INLET"": \n   I, N, L, E, T.\n   N is at position 2 (not 4) and E is at position 4 (not 5). \n\n This seems good.\n\n But let\'s check: we are avoiding C, R, A. ""INLET"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n Another common word: ""SPINE"" -> \n   S, P, I, N, E.\n   N is at position 4? -> but we know N is not at 4, so we avoid.\n\n How about ""NEEDS"": \n   N at position 1 (allowed) and E at position 2 (allowed). But then we have two E\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have D and S.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the word had two E\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If a letter is present twice but we only have one in the guess, then we only get one minus. But if we have two in the guess, then we get two minuses if both are present? Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the letter appears more than once, then the feedback might be tricky. But in this case, we don\'t know.\n\n To keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another word: ""UNITE"" -> \n   U, N, I, T, E.\n   N at position 2 (allowed) and E at position 5? -> but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E is not at 5, but it might be at 5 in a different word? No, the same word? The secret word is fixed. The feedback for the first guess: E was at position 5 and we got a minus, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. So E cannot be at 5 in the secret word. Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at 5.\n\n So ""UNITE"" has E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""UNTIE"": \n   U, N, T, I, E -> but E is at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""INTEG""? But that\'s not a common word.\n\n Another idea: ""SINEW"" -> \n   S, I, N, E, W.\n   N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But we have W, which is less common.\n\n How about ""MINES"": \n   M, I, N, E, S -> but N is at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). However, we have E at 4? That\'s allowed. But note: we have two E\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we are avoiding R, C, A? This word doesn\'t have them.\n\n But we have to be cautious: the feedback for the first guess only showed one E and one N. If the secret word has two E\'s, then we might get two minuses? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E and one N, so we only got one minus for each. So if the word has two E\'s, then when we guess a word with one E, we get one minus. But we don\'t know.\n\n To avoid confusion, let\'s try a word without E at 5 and without N at 4, and without C, R, A.\n\n Let me list some words that fit:\n   Position for N: 1, 2, 3, 5\n   Position for E: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n We can try:\n   N at 1: e.g., ""NEEDS"" -> but has E at 5? Not allowed. \n   N at 1 and E at 4: e.g., ""NAMES"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). \n   N at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""NIGHT"" -> but H and G? And we don\'t know about them.\n\n How about ""NOISE"": \n   N at 1 (allowed), O, I, S, E at 5 -> but E at 5 is not allowed? We know E is not at 5 in the secret word. So we cannot put E at 5.\n\n How about ""NOBLE"": \n   N at 1, O, B, L, E at 5 -> again E at 5: not allowed.\n\n How about ""NEXUS"": \n   N at 1, E at 2 (allowed), X, U, S.\n\n But we don\'t know about X and U.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""LINES"": \n   L, I, N, E, S -> \n      N at position 3 (allowed) and E at position 4 (allowed). \n\n But note: the word ""LINES"" has E at 4? Yes: \n   L (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5).\n\n So N is at 3 (not 4) and E is at 4 (not 5). \n\n Also, we avoid C, R, A.\n\n So ""LINES"" is a candidate.\n\n But wait: we have S at the end. We don\'t know about S.\n\n Another candidate: ""MINES"" -> \n   M (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as above.\n\n However, ""MINES"" has two E\'s? No: M-I-N-E-S -> only one E.\n\n But we have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""MINES"". \n\n We can also consider ""DINER"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), R (5) -> but R is not allowed! We know R is not in the word (from first feedback: R was x). So we cannot use R.\n\n How about ""DINES"": \n   D (1), I (2), N (3), E (4), S (5) -> same as ""MINES"" but with D.\n\n But we don\'t know about D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses more new letters to get more information.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from the first guess). We cannot use C, R, A again. We must use N and E again, but in different positions.\n\n We are required to guess a 5-letter word. Let\'s choose ""LINES"" or ""MINES"". \n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the secret word has N and E, but we don\'t know their positions. We are trying to find the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has N and E in positions we haven\'t tried and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another word: ""SLEPT"" -> \n   S, L, E, P, T.\n   E is at position 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have N? But we know the word must have N. So we must include N? Actually, we don\'t have to, but if we don\'t include N, we won\'t get information about N\'s position. We have 6 tries, so we can try to confirm the presence of N and E? But we already know they are present (from the first feedback). So we should try to find their positions.\n\n Therefore, we should include both N and E in the next guess.\n\n So let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: we have to make sure we don\'t put N at 4 and E at 5. In ""LINES"":\n   N is at position 3 (which is not 4) and E is at position 4 (which is not 5). \n\n So that\'s acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""UNITE"" but we can\'t because E is at 5. \n\n Another word: ""TUNIC"" -> but C is not allowed.\n\n How about ""BONES"": \n   B (1), O (2), N (3), E (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n But we don\'t know about B, O, S.\n\n I think ""LINES"" is a good choice.\n\n However, note that the first guess had N at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Similarly, E was at 5 and now we put at 4.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LINES"".\n\n But wait: what about the letter S? We don\'t know about S. We can try it.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""INES"" but that\'s not a word. \n\n Another common word: ""SENTE"" is not common. \n\n How about ""INLET"": \n   I (1), N (2), L (3), E (4), T (5). \n   N at 2 (allowed) and E at 4 (allowed). \n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n We have two candidates: ""LINES"" and ""INLET"". \n\n We can choose either. Let\'s pick ""INLET"" because it has T at the end, which is common.\n\n But note: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, R, A. Both ""LINES"" and ""INLET"" are free of these.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are trying to get information about the positions of N and E, and also about the other letters.\n\n I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n But let me check: \n   In ""INLET"": \n      Position 1: I -> we don\'t know.\n      Position 2: N -> we know N is present, but we don\'t know if it\'s at 2.\n      Position 3: L -> unknown.\n      Position 4: E -> we know E is present, but not at 5, so 4 is a new position.\n      Position 5: T -> unknown.\n\n This will help us:\n\n   If N is at position 2, we get a check? Or if it\'s present but not at 2, we get a minus.\n\n   Similarly for E at 4.\n\n Also, we get information about I, L, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""LINES"" has N at 3 and E at 4.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let\'s choose ""INLET"" because it uses T which is very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""INLET"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get a check for N at 2. If not, we get a minus and then we know N is at 1,3, or 5? But we are trying position 2.\n\n Similarly for E: if E is at 4, we get a check; if not, we get a minus and then we know E is at 1,2, or 3? (since 4 is the one we tried and it was minus, meaning it\'s not at 4, so in the next guess we can try 1,2,3).\n\n So let\'s choose ""INLET"".\n\n However, note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for N and E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""INLET"": \n   N is at position 2 (we haven\'t tried position 2 for N before) and E is at position 4 (we haven\'t tried position 4 for E).\n\n So that\'s good.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""INLET"".\n\n But let me double-check: \n   First guess: crane -> positions: C(1), R(2), A(3), N(4), E(5)\n   Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)\n\n   Now we are guessing: I(1), N(2), L(3), E(4), T(5)\n\n   We are trying N at 2 and E at 4, which are new positions.\n\n So I think that\'s a good guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SINCE"" but C is not allowed.\n\n Another word: ""WINDS"" -> \n   W (1), I (2), N (3), D (4), S (5). \n   N at 3 (allowed) and we don\'t have E? But we must include E because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip E.\n\n We must include both N and E.\n\n So I think ""INLET"" is a good choice.\n\n Let\'s go with ""INLET"".\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, R, A** are absent from the secret word (marked `x`).\n- **N** is present but not in position 4 (marked `-`).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (marked `-`).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **N** and **E** (since they are confirmed present).\n- **N** cannot be in position 4, and **E** cannot be in position 5.\n- Avoid **C, R, A** entirely.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information.\n\nThe word **""INLET""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **N** in position 2 (new position, not 4).\n- Places **E** in position 4 (new position, not 5).\n- Introduces new common letters: **I, L, T**.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of N and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>inlet</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in word)\n  R: x (not in word)\n  A: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 4)\n  E: - (in word, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""inlet""\n  I: x (not in word)\n  N: - (in word, but not at position 2)  [since it was at position 2 and got minus]\n  L: x (not in word)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  T: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from all feedback so far:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T\nPresent letters: N, E (and we know E is at position 4)\n\nWe also know about N:\n  - From guess 1: N is not at position 4.\n  - From guess 2: N is not at position 2.\n\nTherefore, N must be at position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe know E is at position 4 (from guess 2).\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters. We know:\n  Position 4: E\n\nAnd N is somewhere else: positions 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, L, T (from the two guesses). So we should avoid these except for N and E which are present.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that:\n  - Has E at position 4.\n  - Includes N (but not at position 2 or 4, so at 1, 3, or 5).\n  - Does not contain C, R, A, I, L, T.\n\nWe also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\nAvailable common letters: S, O, U, D, H, M, P, B, G, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n\nPattern: _ _ _ E _\n\nWe need to place N in one of the first three positions or the last position.\n\nCase 1: N at position 1\n  Then the word: N _ _ E _\n  We need to fill the next three positions with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and including the remaining letters.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3\n  Then: _ _ N E _\n  Case 2a: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _\n  Case 2b: N at 3, then the word: _ _ N E _ (with the last letter not at 5? but it can be at 5? Wait, position 5 is available for N? But we have to see.)\n\nActually, N can be at 5 as well because the feedback only said it\'s not at 2 or 4. So positions 1, 3, 5 are possible.\n\nBut note: in case 2b, if N is at position 3, then the word has N at 3 and E at 4. Then the last position can be any letter (not in the absent list) and N cannot be at 5? Wait, no: the word only has one N? We don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. But we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates, so we can\'t be sure. But to be safe, we should consider the possibility.\n\nBut in the feedback, when we guessed ""crane"", we had one N and one E, and the feedback showed one minus for each. Similarly for ""inlet"". So it\'s likely the word has only one N and one E. Therefore, we assume no duplicates.\n\nSo the word has exactly one N and one E.\n\nTherefore, for the remaining positions (2, 1, 5) we need to choose letters that are not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not N or E (since we are using one N and one E).\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nCase 1: N at 1 -> N _ _ E _\n  We need two letters for positions 2, 3, and 5? Actually, three positions. But note: we have two more letters (since we have two more positions: 2, 3, and 5? Actually, positions 2, 3, and 5 are open). But we have only two present letters: N and E, so we need three more letters that are not in the absent list.\n\n  Possible words: \n    ""N"" at 1, then positions 2,3,5: choose from available letters (B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z) but common ones.\n\n  Example: ""NOISE"" -> but O, I, S: but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x) and O and S are available? But wait, ""NOISE"" has I at position 3? But I is absent, so we cannot use I.\n\n  Another: ""NOBLE"" -> but B, L, E: but L is absent (from guess 2: L is x) and E is at 5? But we know E is at 4, so we cannot put E at 5. Also, we have two E\'s? No, ""NOBLE"" has only one E? Actually, it has E at 4? Let\'s spell: N-O-B-L-E -> E is at 5? Not at 4. So we cannot use because E must be at 4.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the word must have E at the fourth position.\n\n  So for case 1: N at 1, then the word: N ? ? E ?\n\n  We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters not in {C,R,A,I,L,T} and not E or N (since we are using one E and one N).\n\n  Example: ""NOMEN"" -> but M, E, N: E is at 4? Actually, ""NOMEN"" is not a common word? And it has two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, we are using N again? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t seen any. So avoid.\n\n  Another: ""NUDGE"" -> but D, G, E: E is at 5? Not at 4. So no.\n\n  How about ""NURSE"" -> but R and U? R is absent (from guess 1) and U is available. But R is absent so we cannot use.\n\n  This is difficult. Let me think of common words.\n\n  ""NOVEL"": \n    N, O, V, E, L -> but L is absent (from guess 2) and E is at 4? Actually, ""NOVEL"": \n      N (1), O (2), V (3), E (4), L (5) -> but L is absent, so we cannot use L.\n\n  ""NOSEY"": \n    N, O, S, E, Y -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"" is not a common word? And it has E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    But we don\'t know about O, S, Y.\n\n  However, we have to avoid L, T, etc. So ""NOSEY"" is acceptable? But is it a valid word? Maybe, but let\'s see.\n\n  Another: ""NOXES"" -> but X and S? And E at 4? \n      N(1), O(2), X(3), E(4), S(5). \n    But X is uncommon.\n\n  ""NAKES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  This is hard. Maybe case 1 is not promising.\n\nCase 2: N at position 3 -> pattern: _ _ N E _\n  Then we need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\n  Example: ""BONES"" -> but B, O, N, E, S -> but O and S are available? \n      B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n    This word: \n      - Has E at 4 (good).\n      - N at 3 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4).\n      - Uses B, O, S which are new and not in the absent list.\n\n  But wait: we have to check if B, O, S are allowed? Yes, they are not in the absent list.\n\n  ""BONES"" is a valid word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  Then we need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""SENTE"" -> not common, and T is absent? T is absent (from guess 2: T is x). So we cannot use T.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S, O, U, N, D -> E is missing? We must have E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""SHOWN"": \n      S, H, O, W, N -> but E is missing? We need E at 4. So no.\n\n  ""POWER"": \n      P, O, W, E, R -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""DOWNS"": \n      D, O, W, N, S -> E is missing? No.\n\n  We need E at 4 and N at 5. So the word must end with ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two letters are E and then N? But that\'s not a word? \n      Instead, we have: ... E at 4 and N at 5: so the word ends with ""EN"". But what words end with ""EN""? \n      Common words: ""SENSE"" -> but S, E, N, C, E -> C is absent and two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? Also, E at 4 and N at 5: \n        S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Here N is at 3 and E at 2? Not matching.\n\n  Actually, we need the fourth letter to be E and fifth to be N. So the word must be ... E N at the end? \n      But the pattern is: _ _ _ E N -> so the last two are E and then N? But that\'s not a single word? \n      Except for words like ""SENSE"" but that has E at 2 and 5, and N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that has E at 4 and N at 5: so the last two letters are ""EN"". But that would be ...? \n      Actually, the word must end with ""EN"". But then the pattern is: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N? \n      But we have E at 4 and N at 5? That would be ... E N. But then the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, in ""SENSE"": \n        Position 4 is C? Not E. \n        We need a word that has the fourth letter as E and fifth as N? \n        That would be ... E N. \n        Words: ""SENSE"" is S-E-N-S-E -> that\'s not E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> but that\'s 5 letters? S-E-N-N-A -> but A is absent and also two N\'s? We don\'t want duplicates.\n\n  This is difficult. Maybe case 3 is not common.\n\nCase 3: N at position 1 -> pattern: N _ _ E _\n  Then we need positions 2,3,5.\n\n  Example: ""NAPES"" -> but A and P? A is absent. \n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s? \n  ""NUKES"" -> but K, E, S: E is at 4? Actually, ""NUKES"": N(1), U(2), K(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This fits: \n        - E is at 4 (good).\n        - N at 1 (which is a new position, not 2 or 4). \n        - Uses U, K, S which are available.\n\n  But is ""NUKES"" a word? It means nuclear weapons, but it\'s accepted in word games sometimes? But let\'s see if there\'s a better one.\n\n  ""NOSES"" -> but O, S, E: E at 4? Actually, ""NOSES"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), S(5) -> but two S\'s? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E at 4 and N at 1. But the word has two S\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s. But we can try? However, we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know, so we can try? But we want to maximize information.\n\n  But ""NOSES"" has two S\'s. We might get less information.\n\n  ""NURSE"" -> but R is absent.\n\n  ""NURDS"" -> not common.\n\n  ""NEXUS"": \n      N(1), E(2), X(3), U(4), S(5) -> but we need E at 4? Here E is at 2. So not.\n\n  We need E at 4. So the pattern is: N ? ? E ?\n\n  So the third letter must be something else. \n\n  ""NAMES"" -> but A is absent.\n\n  ""NOMEN"" -> not common and has two N\'s.\n\n  ""NUKES"" is acceptable? But let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nCase 3: N at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ E N\n  We need positions 1,2,3.\n\n  Example: ""DOWEN"" -> not a word.\n  ""POWER"" -> but R is absent and E is at 4? Actually, ""POWER"": P(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5) -> R absent.\n\n  ""SOUND"" -> E is at 4? Actually, ""SOUND"": S(1), O(2), U(3), N(4), D(5) -> but N is at 4? We know N is not at 4 (from first guess). So we cannot put N at 4. \n      But in this pattern, we are putting N at 5? So the word ends with ""EN"". \n      Examples: ""SENSE"" -> but that ends with ""SENSE"": S(1), E(2), N(3), C(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? \n      Actually, ""SENSE"" has N at 3 and E at 2? Not at 4 and 5.\n\n  How about ""SENNA""? -> S(1), E(2), N(3), N(4), A(5) -> A absent and two N\'s.\n\n  ""SENTE"" -> not common and T is absent.\n\n  ""SOLVE"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""SOLVE"": S(1), O(2), L(3), V(4), E(5) -> but we need E at 4 and N at 5? Not matching.\n\n  We need the word to end with ""EN"". But then the last two letters are fixed: E at 4 and N at 5. \n      So the word must be: ... E N -> meaning the fifth letter is N? \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Examples: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""SENOR"" -> but O and R? R absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""SENNA"" -> not ending with EN.\n\n  How about ""SENTE""? It\'s a word (a type of bird or a machine for spinning) but it ends with TE? Not EN.\n\n  I think it\'s hard to find a word with E at 4 and N at 5. \n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> but then N is at 3, not at 5. \n\n  We need N at 5. So the word must be: ... E N -> so the fifth letter is N. \n      But then the fourth is E. \n      So the word ends with ""EN"". \n\n      Words: \n        ""SENSE"" -> ends with S E N C E -> not E at 4 and N at 5? \n        ""ABUSE"" -> A absent and not ending with EN.\n        ""AMUSE"" -> A absent.\n\n  Actually, I can\'t think of a common word that ends with ""EN"". \n\n  So maybe case 3 is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible is case 2: N at position 3.\n\nSo pattern: _ _ N E _\n\nWe need to fill positions 1,2,5.\n\nWe have to choose letters from: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and not in {C,R,A,I,L,T}).\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nCandidate: ""BONES"" -> B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  - Uses B, O, S (all new) -> good for information.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""BONES"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> N and E are present, the others are new and not absent.\n\nAlso, we are testing B, O, S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CONES"" -> but C is absent.\n\n""ONES"" -> not a word? But ""bones"" is a word.\n\n""bones"": B(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n\nBut we have to check if O and S are allowed? Yes.\n\nAnother candidate: ""DONES"" -> not common? But ""donees"" is a word? But it has two E\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? And we are using E at 4, so the fifth letter would be E? But we don\'t know. Also, ""donees"" is D-O-N-E-E -> two E\'s? Not good.\n\n""HONES"" -> not a word.\n\n""bones"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PONES"" -> not common.\n\n""MINES"" -> but M, I, N, E, S -> but I is absent (from guess 2: I is x). So we cannot use I.\n\n""bones"" is good.\n\nBut let me see if there are other words.\n\n""bones"" is one. What about ""zones""? \n  ""zones"": Z(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is also a candidate.\n\nWe have two candidates: ""bones"" and ""zones"".\n\nWe can choose either. Let\'s pick ""bones"" because it\'s more common.\n\nBut note: we are going to test B, O, S. If we get a check for N at 3? Then we know N is at 3. And we get information about B, O, S.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1 or 5? But we saw difficulties.\n\nAnother word: ""dunes"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""dunes"": D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n  This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U. \n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  But we don\'t know about D and U.\n\n  However, we are trying to find the position of N. If we put N at 3, then we are testing if N is at 3.\n\n  Also, we can try ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But we have two candidates: ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"".\n\n  We can also consider ""hones"" -> not common.\n\n  ""bones"", ""dunes"", ""zones"" are all common.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""dunes"" because it uses U and D, which are less common? But we need to test them.\n\n  However, we have to consider that we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left. But we are making the third guess.\n\n  We want to maximize information. \n\n  In ""dunes"": \n    We test D at 1, U at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""bones"": \n    B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  In ""zones"": \n    Z at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We don\'t know which one is better. But we can choose ""bones"" because B and O are more common than Z.\n\n  However, Z is less common, so maybe we avoid.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is good.\n\n  But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 1? But we had trouble. \n\n  How about ""NOBLE""? But that has E at 5? Not at 4.\n\n  Another idea: ""NOSEY"" -> but E at 4? Actually, ""NOSEY"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This fits the pattern? \n        N at 1 (allowed), E at 4 (good). \n        But we have S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But is ""NOSEY"" a word? It might be considered informal? But we can use it? Or ""noisy"" is the adjective, but we need 5 letters.\n\n  ""NOSEY"" is 5 letters: N-O-S-E-Y -> but then E is at 4? Yes: \n      Position 1: N\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: S\n      Position 4: E\n      Position 5: Y\n\n  This is acceptable? And it uses N at 1, E at 4, and new letters O, S, Y.\n\n  But we are testing N at 1, which is a possibility.\n\n  However, we already know N is in the word, so we are trying to put it at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S and Y.\n\n  Compare to ""bones"": tests N at 3, and tests B, O, S.\n\n  We don\'t know which position N is in, so we might want to test a new position.\n\n  We have three possibilities for N: 1,3,5. We are testing 3 positions at once? Not exactly, because we are fixing N at 3 in ""bones"" and at 1 in ""nosey"". \n\n  We can choose a word that tests N at a position we haven\'t tried? We tried N at 4 (in crane) and at 2 (in inlet) and both were minuses. So we haven\'t tried N at 1 or 3 or 5.\n\n  In ""bones"", we are trying N at 3.\n\n  In ""nosey"", we are trying N at 1.\n\n  We can also try N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word.\n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with H and Y instead of B and O? \n\n  But ""HONEY"" is a common word.\n\n  So we have:\n    Option 1: ""bones"" (N at 3) -> tests B, O, S\n    Option 2: ""nosey"" (N at 1) -> tests N at 1, and O, S, Y\n    Option 3: ""honey"" (N at 3) -> tests H, O, Y\n\n  We can choose one that uses more common letters.\n\n  Common letters: S, O, H, Y, B, etc.\n\n  I think ""bones"" is a good choice because B and O are common.\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" uses B, O, S, N, E -> all are either new or present. \n\n  We are testing B, O, S.\n\n  If we get a check for N at 3, then we know N is at 3. If not, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, if we get a minus for N at 3, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  So let\'s go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we win.\n\n  But we are not there yet.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters.\n\n  Another word: ""DUNES"" -> D(1), U(2), N(3), E(4), S(5). \n      This is similar to ""bones"" but with D and U.\n\n  But ""dunes"" is a common word.\n\n  We can choose ""dunes"" to test D and U.\n\n  But I think ""bones"" is more common.\n\n  However, we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  I think either is fine. Let\'s choose ""bones"".\n\n  But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. ""bones"" does not contain any of the absent letters (C,R,A,I,L,T).\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about the letter O? We haven\'t tested O before.\n\n  We are going to test O at position 2.\n\n  If we get a check for O, then we know O is in the word at position 2. If not, then O is absent.\n\n  Similarly for B and S.\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""bones"".\n\n  But let me confirm: \n    Guess 3: ""bones""\n\n  Pattern: B O N E S\n\n  We know:\n    Position 4: E (will be ✓)\n    Position 3: N (we are testing if it\'s at 3)\n\n  We will get feedback on B, O, S at positions 1,2,5.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t put N at 3? But we have to put N somewhere. We are putting N at 3 to test.\n\n  If we are wrong, then we know N is at 1 or 5.\n\n  But we don\'t have a good word for case 1 and case 3.\n\n  Another word: ""bones"" is acceptable.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position that we know is wrong for N? We are putting N at 3, which we haven\'t tried before (we tried 4 and 2, not 3). So it\'s new.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""bones"".\n\n  However, let me check if there is a word that tests N at 5? We might be missing something.\n\n  How about ""SUNNY"" -> but two N\'s and U? And E is missing? We need E at 4.\n\n  I think we should go with ""bones"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""NOSEY""? \n    ""nosey"": N(1), O(2), S(3), E(4), Y(5). \n    This tests N at 1, O at 2, S at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.\n\n  This tests N at 1, which is a possibility we haven\'t tested. And we test O, S, Y.\n\n  We can use ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  And it\'s a valid word? Yes, meaning nosy parker.\n\n  So we can choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  But we are also testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  I think both ""bones"" and ""nosey"" are acceptable.\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" because we are testing N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried, and we are testing S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  But we already know E is at 4, so we don\'t need to test E again? But we are including it.\n\n  Actually, we are testing the entire word.\n\n  I think ""nosey"" is a good choice.\n\n  But we have to avoid the absent letters: ""nosey"" has N, O, S, E, Y -> no C,R,A,I,L,T. Good.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are testing N at position 1. If we get a check, then we know N is at 1. If not, then N must be at 3 or 5.\n\n  Similarly, we get information about O, S, Y.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find a common word without the absent letters. \n\n  Another word: ""HONEY"" is not ending with N? It ends with Y. \n\n  ""HONEY"": H(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  We need a word that ends with N? Then E at 4 and N at 5: ... E N.\n\n  Words: \n    ""SENNA"" -> not ending with N.\n    ""SENTE"" -> not ending with N and T absent.\n    ""SASEN"" -> not common and A absent.\n\n  I think it\'s safe to say that words ending with ""EN"" are rare. \n\n  Therefore, we can rule out case 3.\n\n  So now we have two cases: N at 1 or N at 3.\n\n  We are testing N at 1 with ""nosey"".\n\n  If we get a minus for N at 1, then N must be at 3.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""bones""? Then we would get a check for N at 3? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 1, we get a check, else if at 3, we get a minus? But in ""nosey"", we are not testing N at 3? We are testing N at 1.\n\n  Actually, in ""nosey"", we are putting N at 1. If the secret word has N at 1, then we get a check. If not, then we get a minus (meaning N is at 3 or 5). \n\n  Then we can adjust.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  But let me see: \n    If the feedback for ""nosey"" shows:\n      N: ✓ -> then N is at 1.\n      N: - -> then N is at 3 or 5.\n      N: x -> but we know N is present, so it cannot be x.\n\n  Similarly for O, S, Y.\n\n  So we get information.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we are also testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""bones"", which tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  Both are good. I\'ll choose ""nosey"" to test N at a new position (1) that we haven\'t tried.\n\n  So guess: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what about ""honey""? It has N at 3 and E at 4, and tests H, O, Y. \n\n  We haven\'t tried H.\n\n  But we are testing N at 3 in ""honey"". \n\n  We are trying to find the position of N. We have three possibilities: 1,3,5. We are testing 1 with ""nosey"" and 3 with ""honey"".\n\n  We can choose one.\n\n  I think I\'ll go with ""nosey"" to test position 1.\n\n  So let\'s do that.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not using absent letters. ""nosey"" is N,O,S,E,Y -> no absent letters.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that has N at 5? But we couldn\'t find one. \n\n  Another word: ""MONEY"" -> but E is at 4? Actually, ""MONEY"": M(1), O(2), N(3), E(4), Y(5) -> N at 3, not at 5.\n\n  ""MONEY"" doesn\'t have N at 5.\n\n  ""PENNE"" -> duplicate E? And N at 1 and 5? Not allowed.\n\n  I think we have to choose between ""bones"", ""zones"", ""dunes"", ""nosey"", ""honey"".\n\n  Let\'s choose ""nosey"" to test N at 1.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we are not testing N at 1? But we are guessing ""nosey"", which has N at 1. If the secret word is ""honey"", then we would get:\n      N: ✓ (if secret is honey: N at 1) or - (if secret is honey: N at 3) -> but in ""nosey"", we have N at 1, so if the secret word has N at 3 (like ""honey"") then we get a minus for N at 1? And then we know N is at 3.\n\n  Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  But we have more guesses.\n\n  So it\'s acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see the feedback we might get:\n\n  If the secret word is, say, ""bones"", then:\n      For ""nosey"": \n        N: if the secret word has N at 1: ✓\n        O: if the secret word has O at 2: ? \n        S: if at 3: ✓? But we don\'t know.\n        E: ✓ (at 4)\n        Y: ? \n\n  But we don\'t know the secret word.\n\n  We are trying to get the word.\n\n  So I think ""nosey"" is a good guess.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try ""bones"" to test N at 3.\n\n  But I think testing N at 1 is as good as testing at 3? We are equally informed.\n\n  We have no information about position 1, so we test it.\n\n  So I\'ll go with ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have O or S? We don\'t know.\n\n  We are testing O at 2 and S at 3 and Y at 5.\n\n  We can also consider ""honey"" to test H and O and Y.\n\n  But I think ""nosey"" is fine.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  But wait: what about ""bones""? It tests B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, S at 5.\n\n  We haven\'t tried position 1 for N? We haven\'t tested position 1 at all? We tested ""crane"" at 1: C, ""inlet"" at 1: I (which was absent). So position 1 has been tested with C and I: both absent. So we don\'t know about other letters at position 1.\n\n  So testing position 1 with N is good.\n\n  Therefore, I choose ""nosey"".\n\n  But let me see: \n    ""nosey"": \n      Position 1: N -> we are testing if N is at 1.\n      Position 2: O -> if O is present and at 2? \n      Position 3: S -> if S is present and at 3?\n      Position 4: E -> ✓ (we know)\n      Position 5: Y -> if Y is present and at 5?\n\n  This will give us good information.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.\n\n  Final decision: ""nosey""\n\n  But wait: what if the secret word is ""honey""? Then we get:\n      N: - (because N is at 3 in ""honey"", not at 1) -> so we know N is at 3.\n      Then we can guess ""honey"" next.\n\n  So it\'s a good test.\n\n  Therefore, I\'ll guess ""nosey"".\n\n  But note: we have to output in the format.\n\n  So the guess is ""nosey"".\n\n  However, let me check if ""nosey"" is a valid word. Yes.\n\n  So I\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"").\n- **N is present** but not in positions 2, 4, or 1 (from Guess 1: `N(-)`; Guess 2: `N(-)`; and ""crane"" had N at position 4 which was wrong, ""inlet"" had N at position 2 which was wrong, and ""nosey"" tests N at position 1).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T (marked `x` in previous feedback).\n\nThe secret word must:\n- Have **E at position 4**.\n- Include **N** in position 1, 3, or 5 (since positions 2, 4, and 1 have been ruled out).\n- Exclude C, R, A, I, L, T.\n\nFor the next guess, ""NOSEY"" is chosen to:\n- Test **N at position 1** (a new position not yet tested).\n- Keep **E at position 4** (confirmed).\n- Introduce new common letters: **O, S, Y** (to gather more information).\n- Avoid absent letters.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of N and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>nosey</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: inlet -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: nosey -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (absent)\n  R: x (absent)\n  A: x (absent)\n  N: - (present, but not at position 4)\n  E: - (present, but not at position 5)\n\nGuess 2: ""inlet""\n  I: x (absent)\n  N: - (present, but not at position 2)\n  L: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  T: x (absent)\n\nGuess 3: ""nosey""\n  N: - (present, but not at position 1)\n  O: ✓ (correct, at position 2)\n  S: x (absent)\n  E: ✓ (correct, at position 4)\n  Y: ✓ (correct, at position 5)\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. Correct positions:\n   - Position 2: O (from ""nosey"": O(✓))\n   - Position 4: E (from ""inlet"": E(✓) and confirmed in ""nosey"")\n   - Position 5: Y (from ""nosey"": Y(✓))\n\n2. So the secret word has: _ O _ E Y\n\n3. Known absent letters: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (from ""nosey"": S(x))\n\n4. Known present letters: N (but not at position 1,2,4? \n   - Not at 1 (from ""nosey"": N(-))\n   - Not at 2 (from ""inlet"": N(-))\n   - Not at 4 (from ""crane"": N(-) and ""inlet"": N(-) which confirms position 4 is E)\n   - Not at 5? We have Y at 5, so N cannot be at 5 because Y is there. But we don\'t have direct feedback on N at 3? \n     - From ""crane"": N at 4 was wrong -> so N not at 4.\n     - From ""inlet"": N at 2 was wrong -> so N not at 2.\n     - From ""nosey"": N at 1 was wrong -> so N not at 1.\n     - Therefore, N must be at position 3?

Therefore, the secret word is: _ O N E Y\n\n6. We only need to find the first letter.\n\n7. The first letter must be a letter that:\n   - Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S.\n   - Is a letter that can form a word with ""ONERY"".\n\n8. Possible words: \n   - ONERY (if first letter is O? but O is at position 2, so we cannot have O at 1? And we don\'t know if O is duplicated? But we have O at 2, so if we put O at 1, it would be a duplicate? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback, so we should consider the possibility? But let\'s see: \n        - In ""nosey"", we had O at 2 and it was correct. If the word had two O\'s, then when we guessed ""nosey"", we would have gotten a minus for the O at 2? Actually, no: because we only have one O? And it was at the correct position. So if there were two O\'s, we might have gotten a minus for the other O? But we don\'t have another O in the guess. So we don\'t know.\n\n   However, to be safe, we should consider that the first letter might be O? But then the word would be ""OONERY""? Not a word. \n\n   So likely, the first letter is not O. \n\n   We need a word: [letter] ONERY\n\n   Common words: \n     ""BONEY"" -> but we have Y at 5? Actually, ""BONEY"" is B-O-N-E-Y -> which matches the pattern: B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5. \n        But we have to check if B is allowed? We haven\'t tested B. And it\'s not in the absent list.\n\n     ""CONEY"" -> but C is absent.\n\n     ""DONEY"" -> not a common word? But let\'s check: it might be a variant of donkey? But not standard.\n\n     ""HONEY"" -> H-O-N-E-Y -> which is a common word.\n\n     ""MONEY"" -> M-O-N-E-Y -> common word.\n\n     ""PONEY"" -> not common.\n\n     ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.\n\n     ""WONEY"" -> not common.\n\n     ""BONEY"" and ""HONEY"" and ""MONEY"" are candidates.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid the absent letters. \n        - ""BONEY"": B is new, O, N, E, Y -> O, N, E, Y are known, B is new -> good.\n        - ""HONEY"": H is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.\n        - ""MONEY"": M is new, O, N, E, Y -> good.\n\n   But we don\'t know which one. We need to test the first letter.\n\n   However, we have only one position left, so we can guess one of these.\n\n   But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the fourth guess. We can guess one of these.\n\n   How to choose? We can pick one that uses a common letter? Or we can pick one that might be the word.\n\n   We don\'t have any information about the first letter. We have to guess.\n\n   But we can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in previous guesses. So we don\'t know about them.\n\n   We can choose ""HONEY"" because H is a common letter? Or ""MONEY"" because M is common? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: we have to fill the first position. We can try ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: if we guess ""HONEY"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback and then we can try another.\n\n   However, we have three candidates: ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"". \n\n   But wait: are there more? \n      ""PONEY"" -> not common.\n      ""TONEY"" -> T is absent.\n      ""WONEY"" -> not common.\n\n   So likely, it\'s one of these three.\n\n   We can also consider: we have not tested B, H, M in any guess? So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we can choose ""HONEY"" because it\'s a common word.\n\n   However, we must be cautious: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Or ""DONERY""? Not a word.\n\n   So the candidates are: BONEY, HONEY, MONEY.\n\n   We can guess ""HONEY"" and if it\'s not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one of those.\n\n   But we have two more guesses after this? We are on guess 4, so we have 2 more after this? Actually, we have 6 total, so after this we have 2 left.\n\n   So we can guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me see: \n        If we guess ""HONEY"":\n          If it\'s correct, we win.\n          If not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.\n\n   Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes B, H, M? But we only have one position to fill. We are forced to guess one of these.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if the word has H, B, or M. We haven\'t tested any of them.\n\n   So we have to choose one.\n\n   I think ""HONEY"" is a good guess because H is a common letter.\n\n   But we can also consider: we have already used O, N, E, Y in the current guess? We are going to use them again? Actually, we have to: because the word is almost known.\n\n   The secret word pattern: ? O N E Y\n\n   We don\'t know the first letter, so we have to guess one of the candidates.\n\n   We can choose ""HONEY"".\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get feedback that H is absent? And we know it\'s B.\n\n   Similarly, if we guess ""HONEY"" and the feedback shows:\n        H: if absent, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we can guess one.\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s safe.\n\n   However, we can also consider: we have not tested the letter B, H, M in any context. So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we can try to use a word that has multiple candidates? But we can\'t because we only have one position.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not one of the candidates but that tests the first letter with B, H, M? But we cannot because we must have the pattern: ? O N E Y. \n\n   Therefore, we must guess one of the candidates.\n\n   I think ""HONEY"" is a good choice.\n\n   So let\'s go with ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are not sure if the word is ""HONEY"". We are just guessing.\n\n   We can also consider: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Another candidate: ""DONERY"" is not a word.\n\n   So the only common words are ""BONEY"", ""HONEY"", ""MONEY"".\n\n   We\'ll guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me double-check the feedback we would get if the word is ""BONEY"" and we guess ""HONEY"":\n\n        H: absent -> x\n        O: correct -> ✓\n        N: correct -> ✓ (because in ""BONEY"", N is at 3, same as in ""HONEY"")\n        E: correct -> ✓\n        Y: correct -> ✓\n\n        So feedback: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) E(✓) Y(✓)\n\n        Then we know the word is ?ONERY, and we try ""BONEY"" next.\n\n   Similarly, if the word is ""MONEY"", we get the same feedback for ""HONEY"", and then we try ""MONEY"".\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that is not a candidate but that tests the first letter? But we cannot because we must have the known letters.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are not forced to use the known letters? We could use a different word? But then we would be wasting the known letters? Because we know they are in the word and in those positions.\n\n   We should use the known letters to get the word.\n\n   So I think ""HONEY"" is the best guess.\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY""? Then we guess one.\n\n   We can also consider: we have not used B, H, M in any guess. So we don\'t have information. \n\n   But we don\'t need to test the letters in the other positions? Because we are only missing the first letter.\n\n   So I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\n   I\'ll choose ""HONEY"".\n\n   So the guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two more after this.\n\n   So let\'s do that.\n\n   However, we must output the guess.\n\n   But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n   Another possibility: ""DONERY"" is not a word.\n\n   So I think it\'s safe.\n\n   Therefore, the next guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   But let me see the pattern: \n        Position 1: unknown (but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,I,L,T,S} and must form a word)\n        Position 2: O (fixed)\n        Position 3: N (fixed)\n        Position 4: E (fixed)\n        Position 5: Y (fixed)\n\n   So the word must be ?ONERY.\n\n   We have three possibilities: B, H, M.\n\n   We can guess ""HONEY"" to test H.\n\n   If it\'s not, then we know it\'s either ""BONEY"" or ""MONEY"", and we guess one.\n\n   But we have two more guesses, so it\'s okay.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""HONEY"".\n\n   But note: we have to output the guess.\n\n   So the guess is ""HONEY"".\n\n   Format: <guess>honey</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E is confirmed at position 4** and **Y at position 5** (from Guess 2 and 3).\n- **O is confirmed at position 2** (from Guess 3).\n- **N is present** but ruled out of positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 (from Guesses 1-3). The only remaining position is 3, so **N must be at position 3**.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S (marked `x`).\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ O N E Y`\n\nThe first letter must:\n- Be a valid English letter not in the absent list.\n- Form a 5-letter word with ""ONERY"".\n- Not be C, R, A, I, L, T, S.\n\nPossible candidates: **BONEY**, **HONEY**, **MONEY**.\n\n""HONEY"" is chosen to test **H** (a common letter) at position 1.

However, in the feedback for ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present, so if there were two N\'s, we might have gotten two minuses? But we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only got one minus. Similarly in other guesses. So it\'s likely no duplicates. Therefore, we assume the first letter is not N (because if it were, we would have seen duplicates in the feedback? Not necessarily: because we never put N at position 1 in a guess? Actually, in ""nosey"", we put N at 1 and got a minus, so N is not at 1. But we don\'t know about duplicates: if the word had two N\'s, we might have gotten a minus for N at 1 even if another N is at 3? But in ""nosey"", we have only one N (at position 1) and it was marked as minus, meaning there is an N but not at 1. It doesn\'t say anything about a duplicate N at 3. However, in ""honey"", we have N at 3 and it was correct, so if there were a duplicate N at 1, we wouldn\'t know because we never tested N at 1 in a way that would show a duplicate? \n\nBut let\'s think: if the word were ""NONEY"", then in ""honey"" we have:\n  H (absent) -> correct because ""NONEY"" has no H.\n  O, N, E, Y: correct.\n\nBut in ""NONEY"", the first letter is N. We never tested N at position 1? But in ""nosey"", we tested N at 1 and got a minus, meaning that N is not at 1. But if the word is ""NONEY"", then N is at 1. So that would contradict the feedback of ""nosey"": because we got a minus for N at 1, meaning that N is not at 1. Therefore, ""NONEY"" is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, we have to check if there is a word ""BONNY"": \n  B-O-N-N-Y -> but then the first letter is B, and the third letter is N.

But if the word is ""BONNY"", then the fourth letter is N, which we didn\'t guess. So we don\'t get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don\'t have a letter at 4 that is N in ""honey"". \n\n  But the feedback for ""honey"" only tells us about the letters we guessed. For ""honey"": \n      H: absent -> correct for ""BONNY"" because H is not in it.\n      O: correct -> matches.\n      N: correct -> matches the N at position 3, but not at 4? In ""BONNY"", there is an N at 3 and at 4. We only guessed N at 3, so we get a check for that. The N at 4 in the secret word is not covered by our guess (we guessed Y at 5, not N). So we don\'t get information about the fourth position? Actually, we don\'t have a letter at position 4 that is N? We have Y at 5, so if the secret word has N at 4, we wouldn\'t guess it because we have Y at 5. So we don\'t know.\n\n  But in ""BONNY"", the fourth letter is N. We have not guessed any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). So we don\'t have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don\'t get any information about position 4 having N? But we already know that the word has N (from the first guess) and we have placed N at 3. If the word has another N? We don\'t know.\n\n  However, in ""honey"", we only guessed one N (at 3), so if the secret word has two N\'s, we only get information about one N. So it\'s possible that the secret word has N at 3 and another N at 4? But we don\'t know.\n\n  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was marked as present (minus). In ""inlet"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""nosey"", we had one N and it was minus. In ""honey"", we had one N and it was correct. So if the secret word had two N\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. Similarly, in other guesses, we only have one N. So if the secret word has two N\'s, then when we guess a word with one N, we only get one minus. But we don\'t know if there is a second N. \n\n  However, in the pattern we have: the word is _ O N E Y. If we try ""BONNY"", then it has two N\'s: one at 3 and one at 4. But we haven\'t guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don\'t know about N at 4? \n\n  But in ""honey"", we didn\'t guess any letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, not N. So we don\'t get information about position 4. \n\n  However, we can infer: if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then in the feedback for ""honey"", we would have:\n      H: absent (correct)\n      O: correct (✓)\n      N: correct (✓) -> because N at 3 is correct, and the secret word has N at 3 and also at 4? But we didn\'t guess the fourth position? \n      But we guessed E at 4, which is correct. So if the secret word has N at 4, then we wouldn\'t have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4, which is correct. So we don\'t get any indication that there is an N at 4? Because we didn\'t guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed Y at 5, which is not N.\n\n  So we don\'t know about a duplicate N. \n\n  But in the first guess ""crane"", we had only one N and it was minus. If the secret word has two N\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"", we would have gotten a minus for N (at 4) if the secret word had an N at 4? But we didn\'t guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and it was minus, meaning that N is in the word but not at 4. If the word had two N\'s, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn\'t guess it, so we don\'t know.\n\n  However, in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and it was minus, so if the secret word has two N\'s, then we would have an N at 2? But we didn\'t guess it. \n\n  So we cannot rule out duplicates. \n\n  But in the current pattern, we have: \n      Position 1: unknown\n      Position 2: O\n      Position 3: N\n      Position 4: E\n      Position 5: Y\n\n  And we know the word must be a valid English word.\n\n  The candidates we had were ""BONEY"", ""MONEY"", and possibly others? But we ruled out ""NONEY"" because we tested N at 1 and got a minus (so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"" or ""inlet""? Actually, in ""inlet"", N at 2 was minus, so if N were at 1, we would have gotten a minus in ""inlet"" for N? No, in ""inlet"", N was at 2 and got minus, but that doesn\'t say anything about position 1. \n\n  Actually, we never tested N at position 1. So it\'s possible that N is at 1? But we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if the word had two N\'s, then N at 1 is not possible, but we can have N at 3 and another N? \n\n  But in the pattern, we have position 3 as N. If we try ""BONNY"", then the word has N at 3 and at 4. We haven\'t guessed a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don\'t know.\n\n  However, we can check the feedback for ""honey"": \n      We guessed H at 1 (absent), O at 2 (correct), N at 3 (correct), E at 4 (correct), Y at 5 (correct). \n      If the secret word were ""BONNY"", then:\n          H: absent (correct)\n          O: correct\n          N: correct (for the N at 3)\n          But E: correct (for position 4)\n          Y: correct (for position 5)\n          And the fourth letter (E) is not N? But we have E at 4 and the secret word has N at 4? Then why didn\'t we get a minus for the N at 3? Because in ""BONNY"", the N at 3 is correct, so we get a check. But the secret word also has N at 4? We didn\'t guess a letter at position 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4, which is correct. So we don\'t have a letter at 4 that is N? We have E at 4. So we don\'t get any indication that there is an N at 4? But we know from the first guess that N is not at 4 (because ""crane"" had N at 4 and got minus). So if the secret word has N at 4, that would contradict the first guess? Because the first guess said N is not at 4. So the secret word cannot have N at 4. Therefore, ""BONNY"" is impossible because it has N at 4? But wait, ""BONNY"" has N at 3 and 4? So if the secret word is ""BONNY"", then:\n        - First guess ""crane"": N at 4 -> minus (correct, because N is at 3 and 4? But we don\'t know about duplicates? Actually, if the secret word has two N\'s, then when we guessed ""crane"" with N at 4, we should have gotten a minus (because one N is at 3, so the N at 4 is not at the same position? But wait, the feedback for ""crane"" said N is present but not at 4. If the secret word has two N\'s, then there is an N at 4? But we didn\'t guess it, so we don\'t know. However, in the first guess, we only got one minus for N, so if there were two N\'s, we would have gotten two minuses? Actually, no: because we only had one N in ""crane"", so we only get one minus. So if the secret word has two N\'s, then when we guess ""crane"", we only mark one N as present? But we don\'t know which one. \n\n  Actually, the feedback is per letter: if the secret word has two N\'s, and we guess one N in the wrong position, we get a minus. But we don\'t know which position is correct for that N? \n\n  However, in ""crane"", we had N at 4 and got a minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. \n\n  But in ""inlet"", we had N at 2 and got a minus, so if there is an N at 4, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? \n\n  This is confusing. \n\n  Let me reexamine: \n\n  First guess ""crane"": \n      C: absent -> okay\n      R: absent -> okay\n      A: absent -> okay\n      N: present but not at 4 -> okay (because even if there is an N at 4, we didn\'t guess it, so we only get a minus for the N we guessed at 4? But we didn\'t guess N at 4? We guessed N at 4? Actually, in ""crane"", we have N at 4 and the feedback says minus. That means that there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn\'t tell us about other positions. \n\n  But if the secret word has two N\'s, then we would have an N at 4? But we didn\'t guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed E at 4. So we don\'t get any indication that there is an N at 4? We get only that N is present and not at 4. \n\n  Similarly, in ""inlet"": we had N at 2 and got minus. That means there is an N in the word that is not at 2. It doesn\'t say anything about position 4? \n\n  So it is possible that the secret word has an N at 4? But we have to check the feedback for ""crane"": \n      The feedback for ""crane"" says N is present but not at 4. That is, there is an N in the word that is not at 4. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. \n\n  But in ""inlet"", we have N at 2 and got minus, so if there is an N at 4, we don\'t know because we didn\'t guess a letter at 4 that is N? We guessed L at 3? \n\n  This is ambiguous. \n\n  However, we can look at the pattern: the secret word is ? O N E Y. \n      If the first letter is B, then it\'s ""BONEY"". \n      If the first letter is M, then ""MONEY"".\n      If the first letter is N, then ""NONEY"" (but we already ruled out ""NONEY"" because we got a minus for N at 1? But wait, we got a minus for N at 1 in ""nosey"", meaning N is not at 1. So if we try ""NONEY"", then we would be putting N at 1? But we know N is not at 1. So we cannot have ""NONEY"".\n\n  Therefore, the first letter cannot be N? Because we already tested N at 1 and got a minus. \n\n  So the first letter is not N, and not any of the absent letters.\n\n  Now, back to the candidates:\n      ""BONEY"": B at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.\n      ""MONEY"": M at 1, O at 2, N at 3, E at 4, Y at 5.\n\n  And ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.\n\n  Also, we have other possibilities? \n      ""CONERY"" -> but C is absent.\n      ""DONERY"" -> not a word.\n      ""PONEY"" -> not common, and we haven\'t tested P? But we can eliminate.\n\n  So the two main candidates are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".\n\n  We can guess one of them.\n\n  Since we are on the fifth guess, we can try ""BONEY"".\n\n  If it\'s not, then we know it\'s ""MONEY"".\n\n  But we have two more guesses, so it\'s safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try a word that tests both B and M? But we cannot because we have only one position to fill. We are forced to choose one.\n\n  But note: we don\'t have to guess a word that is one of the candidates? We could guess a word that includes B and M? But we cannot because we have to have the known letters. \n\n  We are forced to guess a word that has the pattern: ? O N E Y. \n\n  The only common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". \n\n  We can also consider ""WONEY"" -> not common.\n\n  Or ""JONEY"" -> not common.\n\n  So we choose one.\n\n  I\'ll go with ""BONEY"" because B is a common letter.\n\n  But we can also consider: what if the word is ""BONEY""? Then we get it right.\n\n  If we guess ""BONEY"" and it\'s correct, we win.\n\n  If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".\n\n  So let\'s guess ""BONEY"".\n\n  But note: we have to output the guess.\n\n  So the guess is ""BONEY"".\n\n  But wait: what if the word is ""CONERY""? But C is absent.\n\n  Or ""DONERY"" -> not a word.\n\n  So I think it\'s safe.\n\n  Therefore, the next guess is ""BONEY"".\n\n  But let me confirm the pattern: \n      Position 1: B (or M)\n      Position 2: O (correct)\n      Position 3: N (correct)\n      Position 4: E (correct)\n      Position 5: Y (correct)\n\n  So if we guess ""BONEY"":\n      If the secret word is ""BONEY"", we win.\n      If not, then it must be ""MONEY"".\n\n  So we do that.\n\n  But note: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. \n\n  What about ""NONEY""? We already ruled out because we know N is not at 1 (from ""nosey"" feedback: N at 1 was minus). So ""NONEY"" is impossible.\n\n  Similarly, ""HONEY"" we tried and H is absent.\n\n  So only two candidates: ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"".\n\n  We\'ll guess ""BONEY"".\n\n  If it\'s not, then we guess ""MONEY"" next.\n\n  But we have two more guesses, so it\'s okay.\n\n  So the guess is ""BONEY"".\n\n  Format: <guess>boney</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Fixed positions**:\n  - Position 2: **O** (from Guess 3: `O(✓)` in ""nosey"")\n  - Position 3: **N** (from Guess 4: `N(✓)` in ""honey"")\n  - Position 4: **E** (from Guess 2: `E(✓)` in ""inlet"" and confirmed in ""honey"")\n  - Position 5: **Y** (from Guess 3: `Y(✓)` in ""nosey"" and ""honey"")\n\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H (marked `x` in previous feedback).\n\n- **Pattern**: The secret word is `_ O N E Y`.\n\n- **First letter constraints**: \n  - Must be a valid English letter not in the absent list.\n  - Must form a real word with ""ONERY"".\n  - Cannot be **N** (ruled out by Guess 3: `N(-)` in ""nosey"") or **O, E, Y** (which are already placed).\n\n- **Candidates**: \n  - **BONEY** (B at position 1)\n  - **MONEY** (M at position 1)\n\nGiven that ""HONEY"" was guessed and ruled out (H absent), and ""NONEY"" is invalid (N cannot be at position 1), the only remaining common words are ""BONEY"" and ""MONEY"". \n\n""BONEY"" is chosen to test **B** at position 1.

We have the feedback from the fifth guess ""boney"":
  B: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct at position 2)
  N: ✓ (correct at position 3)
  E: ✓ (correct at position 4)
  Y: ✓ (correct at position 5)

This tells us:
- B is absent (so the first letter is not B)
- O, N, E, Y are still correct at their positions.

Given this, the secret word is still in the form: _ O N E Y

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list: C, R, A, I, L, T, S, H, B (from previous feedback)
- Forms a valid English word with ""ONERY""

Remaining common candidates:
- **MONEY**: M at position 1
- **Other possibilities?** 
  - ""CONERY"": C is absent -> invalid.
  - ""DONERY"": not a valid word.
  - ""PONEY"": not a standard word.
  - ""TONEY"": T is absent -> invalid.
  - ""WONEY"": not common.

So the only common word left is **MONEY**.

Therefore, the secret word must be **MONEY**.
